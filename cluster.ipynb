By all means. Bon jour, Mademoiselle.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Bon jour, Madame.â\\x80\\x99 This little conference took place upon the staircase of an old dilapidated sombre house in Dieppe. It stood in the midst of the street, with shops on either side, and a dark archway for an entrance ; the pavement was broken and painfully uneven, and on the north side of the archway a little door conducted you into the house. Nothing about the place excited the imagina 172 tion, or brought up fanciful pictures of what might once have been there ;â\\x80\\x94it was a common-place house, fallen into common 172 place decay ; the passages were narrow and dismal, the rooms bare, the glass in the windows tinged with green. And yet, by some strange freak of the architect, it possessed one magnificent feature in a wonderful old oak staircase, ascending from a little flagged court, round which the house was built, so that its sides, protected by heavy black balustrades, were open to the air. The steps were broad and shallow ; the oak panelling and mas 172 sive rails, black with age and rubbing, were carved with all manner of quaint, almost uncouth devices; and each flight ended with a little landing from whence, over the railing, you might look up or down as the fancy seized you. Up, if you loved to follow the grotesque windings of the black staircase, on which the sunlights became golden, the shadows alrhost terrible in their gloom,-â\\x80\\x94the solid balustrade at the top, the slightly overhanging roof, and then, with all its exquisite colouring condensed and deepened by this preparation, a few square yards of sky, of a blue too tender to dazzle, too intense to weary, too heavenly for anything on earth to be compared to it. Very often there were pigeons flying about the opening; sometimes they would perch upon the edge of the roof, andURSULE. 3 Ursule, standing upon her landingâ\\x80\\x94the highestâ\\x80\\x94would coax them out of their stately graces to come and pick up the crumbs she scattered for them. There was a pretty picture to look at then. The young girl leaning over the carved black railings, half in shadow, half in light, her slender throat curved back, her smiling face raised to watch the birds fluttering round the open 172 ing ; over all, the unfathomable depth of sunlit blue. A few more shy advances, and with a soft rustle of wings the first grey pigeon flies down upon the balustrade, another lights on the girlâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder, a third follows, and, babbling and cooing to each other, Ursule and her favourites flit in and out among the deep shadows overhead. This, if you were fortunate, was what you might not unfre- quently see, if you stood upon the landing of Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s floor and looked upwards for a little while. But, for those who cared to keep their eyes and their thoughts in the world below, there was another point of view in the contemplation of which they would probably be joined by Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny herself. For while Ursule loved to gaze up at the sky, and the flickering lights, and her pearl-coloured pigeons, Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, when she stopped on her landing to take breath after the ascent, as instinctively cast down her eyes towards the glazed corner of the little room beneath, which served Sanson and his wife, the master and mistress of the house, for kitchen, salon, and bed 172 chamber in one : whence aroseâ\\x80\\x94Monsieur being in his way a gourmandâ\\x80\\x94savoury whiffs of seasoned compounds which caused poor Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny to close her eyes, shake her head, and inveigh somewhat bitterly to Ursule against those greedy lovers of self who care for nothing higher than the miserable pleasures of the table. â\\x80\\x98 Never be like such,â\\x80\\x99 she would say with half-pathetic eager-4 ONE YEAR. ness, â\\x80\\x98 never so degrade yourself. Imitate me, who have always resisted selfish indulgences, always sacrificed the flesh. And yet I have had my temptations in those bygone days. What pÃ¢tÃ©s !â\\x80\\x94what fricandeaux ! You, with your eternal soups and vegetables, and only an occasional chocolate bon-bon for conso 172 lation, know absolutely nothing of what a fricandeau may be. But it is vanity ; it must all be renounced, child.â\\x80\\x99 Upon which Ursule, who had no fricandeaux to renounce, would look at Madame and wonder vaguely whether by sacri 172 ficing the flesh it must grow so wrinkled and colourless as the wizened face before her. Threescore years and upwards set their mark more unmistakably upon a French than an English woman, to which must be added that Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny had not only known many sorrows and some reverse of fortune, but had lived alone with her sad memories until she unconsciously multiplied them, and actually revelled in troubles which she had never experienced. She had her fits of vivacity, and her fits of depression. In the former she employed herself by going out to visit the little circle of acquaintances with whom she still kept up a ceremonious intercourse, or by bargaining in the market : in the latter she sat drearily at home, bewailed herself to Ursule, and inveighed with particular fervour against the odour of Monsieur Sansonâ\\x80\\x99s little stews. Madame was tall, gaunt, untidy-looking. Her white frizzly hair was arranged round her face in tiers of short horizontal curls. When she spoke, her eyes still sparkled keenly, but her eyebrows lifted her forehead into long ridged lines. She had lived in the old house fifteen years ; Ursule, her father and her brother, nineâ\\x80\\x94more than half the girlâ\\x80\\x99s lifetime, for she was only seventeen, and they came to the Sansonsâ\\x80\\x99 a short time before her mother died. Madame was au premier ; the Lafons, au second. Madame, al-URSULE. 5 though, as she would tell you, by many heartrending circum 172 stances reduced to poverty, had never dropped the aristocratic de which preceded her name and lifted her above the level of ordinary mortals. Jean Lafon, although calling himself artist, cared little in what level he found himself. Madame could not possibly know the family. Madame never once in all those long years had ascended au second. Madame shut her eyes to the fact that there were other lodgers in the house. But when a little brown sprite came dancing down the stairs at all manner of unexpected times, and, with the undaunted confidence of childhood, wished Madame a smiling 1 Bon jour,â\\x80\\x99 it was impos 172 sible to ignore her existence or to avoid making friends. Ursule was soon free of the first floor ; and since that period Madame had alternately petted, scolded, entreated, quarrelled with, and in vain attempted to tyrannize over her. The girl was loving and compassionate, but of too wilful a spirit to succumb to her dominion, and utterly and immeasurably scornful over the su 172 periority conferred by a de. It was not therefore to be wondered at that quarrels between the oddly assorted pair were frequent, and that Ursule was in the habit of keeping angrily away from Madameâ\\x80\\x99s room, to the extreme discomfort of the latter, until, scolded into propriety by Louis, or smitten with sudden com punction at the idea of the desolation below, she would fly down the staircase into the cold bare room, always carefully designated by Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny the salon, sure of the same scene meeting her eyesâ\\x80\\x94the red brick floor partially hidden by little strips of carpetâ\\x80\\x94the bed in its cupboard-like recess, curtained off from viewâ\\x80\\x94the great gilt clock, with fat Cupids supporting it, ticking monotonously on the chimney-pieceâ\\x80\\x94two pieces of modern French china on either sideâ\\x80\\x94and Madame, with a rigid and melancholy face, sitting sadly at the window, seeking distraction6 ONE YEAR. by watching the hairdresserâ\\x80\\x99s shop opposite, and the little crowd continually passing out and in. On the evening of the day when the short conversation al 172 ready related took place, Ursule found it thus. She received no greeting or notice of any kind, not so much as a look ; but she knew Madame too well to expect it, nor, to tell the truth, was her penitence deep. She only shrugged her shoul 172 ders impatiently, began to hum a merry country chanson, and, snatching a brush from its hiding-place, energetically attacked the comers of the room, and presently raised a dust which was certainly set flying rather more extensively than was necessary. Madame was quite conscious of her enemyâ\\x80\\x99s tactics, and struggled hard to preserve her dignity. It was in vain. Fairly driven to desperation by the cloud that enveloped her, she rose up, and angrily shaking her skirts, exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98 Have done, then, with folly, Ursule ! this is not a time to disturb me thus ! In the morning, when I was absent, it would have been a suitable attention; but I desire that I may at least be permitted to pass my evenings in peace.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah, pardon!\\' answered Ursule, pausing in her labour, and looking a pretty roguish picture, as she daintily turned back her cuffs, and stole a glance at Madame with sparkling eyes. â\\x80\\x98 I am grieved to disarrange Madame, but she sees the state of the room ; it is really a disgrace â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It should have been done this morning.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 This morning ? ah, yes ! But I had so much to occupy me this morning; Madame Paul sent for me, and Louisâ\\x80\\x94poor Louis !â\\x80\\x94has been so suffering.â\\x80\\x99 The mischievous expression faded out of her eyes, her voice became unconsciously sorrowful, her figure drooped : Madame grew interested in the change.URSULE. 7 â\\x80\\x98I know the reason,â\\x80\\x99 said she, decidedly. â\\x80\\x98Yesterday he sat too long in the balcony. The sun was scorching, and I heard your voices there for hours.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98It may have been so,â\\x80\\x99 Ursule said wearily, letting the brush drop, the dust subside into fresh lodgments, and seating herself upon the low window-sill in her favourite attitude, her hands clasped round one knee. â\\x80\\x98 But sometimes I think there always is something ; and it is so little, so little that does it.â\\x80\\x99 Madame was too sensible of the relief of having her young- opponent at her feet, dejected, softened, requiring only sympathy to be completely subdued, to dare to push her advantage far ; but she could not refrain from one slap. â\\x80\\x98The young persons of this day have no prudence. They adopt their own ways, their own plans. They reject their eldersâ\\x80\\x99 counsel.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9cI am sure we reject no oneâ\\x80\\x99s counsel,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, still sad; \\'â\\x80\\x99on the contraiy, it seems to me that we follow everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s by turn. But vesterday Louis was so restless and uneasy in the room . at least it gave him a change to have the air in the balcony, and I remembered that you had warned me last week that the evening air was evil. What can one do ? If one has not the sun, one must have the dew; if one has not the dew, one must have the sun ! There is always something. And he seemed better; ne had quite an appetite for the little cake good Madame Sanson brought up to him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh!â\\x80\\x99 said Madame sententiously, â\\x80\\x98I am satisfied. That explains all. If you will allow the Sansons to overwhelm him with their coarse cookery, no wonder that the poor boy is suf 172 fering.â\\x80\\x99 Madame pulled some knitting out of a capacious pocket, and applied herself to its intricacies with an air of having satisfac-s ONE YEAR. torily disposed of the subject. Ursule broke into a merry laugh, her buoyant spirit in a moment shaking off the depres 172 sion which had clouded it. â\\x80\\x98 Their coarse cookery is very fine to us; we have had no experience to make us dainty in our tastes. You shake your head : ah, well, what would you have? One must taste to know. Besides which, to me Madameâ\\x80\\x99s dishes are delicious ; only I cannot bear so much as to touch them when it is so good for Louis to have a change. But I must return to him directly,â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, springing up from her low seat ; â\\x80\\x98 and after all the room is not finished, Madame. Would you rather I waited until to-morrow ? Really, the dust is as thick as all that,â\\x80\\x99 raising one hand above the other to show an appalling depth. â\\x80\\x98 Bah, bah ! â\\x80\\x99 returned the old lady, with impatience ; â\\x80\\x98 what has done will do ; the dust makes no mischief, if only you will let it alone. However, if you must, to-morrowâ\\x80\\x94yes, to-morrow, when I go to market. That old cochon, Michael, sold me eggs yesterday that were not fresh. To-morrow, child, dust every 172 thing, and make it tidy. Thursday is the FÃªte Dieu, and Madame Grignon and Madame Larousse come to me to see the spectacle from my salon. Ciel, what a fÃªte it will be ! All the newly confirmed in their fresh white toilettesâ\\x80\\x94soldiers, music, everything that can inspire us. Ah, you poor Protes 172 tants, what a dull religion they give you, who are called your priests ! We shall sit on the balcony, and Madame Grignon, who is connected distantly with Monsieur lâ\\x80\\x99AbbÃ© dâ\\x80\\x99O., assures me on the best authority that one of the stations will be exactly in front of this house, so that all the procession will be stopped, and we shall see it to perfection. It is not every one, after all, who has the advantage of living an premier; the position assists one to endure muchâ\\x80\\x94even the smell of Sansonâ\\x80\\x99s bad cooking.URSULE. 9 Of what are you thinking, Ursule?â\\x80\\x99 Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny added, patting her hand with unusual graciousness. â\\x80\\x98 Some day, who knows ? you too may live au premier.\\' â\\x80\\x98 It was not of that I was thinking,â\\x80\\x99 Ursule answered ab 172 stractedly, â\\x80\\x98 but of the fÃªte. For the other, I do not wish it ; I like the second best. It is nearer the sky.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Nearer the sky ! Is it possible !â\\x80\\x94do I dream ! Do you talk of the sky, which is so common that everybody can see it ! And this, after all the care, the pains, I have taken to form, to give ideas. I can do no moreâ\\x80\\x94I yieldâ\\x80\\x94I wash my hands of you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But you cannot dust your room without me,â\\x80\\x99 interrupted Ursule, merrily. â\\x80\\x98 Ban soir, Madame ; I undertake that every 172 thing shall be as you like it for your friends, and I will bring down the great oak chair which stands in our room, so that you shall receive them like a princess.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah ! â\\x80\\x99 said Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, mollified ; â\\x80\\x98 stay, Ursule â\\x80\\x99 But the girl was already gone. She ran gladly up the stairsâ\\x80\\x94she was always glad when going back to Louisâ\\x80\\x94and at the door she stopped, smiling. To ordinary eyes there was not much to smile over in the room itself; while not so formal in arrangement, it was even more shabbily furnished than Madameâ\\x80\\x99s down below ; only the most necessary articles remained in it, and theseâ\\x80\\x94with the exception of one very handsome high-backed oak chair, which seemed to belong to the same date as the staircaseâ\\x80\\x94were of the roughest, plainest description. A curtain portioned off the little recess where Ursule slept, it is true ; but, long ago, the last vestige of colour had been washed out of the flowered chintz which com 172 posed it. The glass in the windows was so green and uneven, that nothing looked natural which was viewed through itsIO ONE YEAR. medium â\\x96\\xa0, and as to the floor, there was no attempt at cover 172 ing the red bricks except at one spot, where reposed a tiny square of faded carpet. Yet the room was far prettier and more interesting than Madameâ\\x80\\x99s salon,- and contained certain points on which the eye rested with pleasure. Leaning against the wall were a few pictures, one or two mere sketches daubed in with bright dashes of colour, but all in their way significant and powerful. One there was in particular which arrested the fancy, a long low painting of a sea view, wild and gloomy, as if it repre 172 sented the gradual rising of a storm. There was no land, no ship, no human interest, and yet the picture was a poem. Piles of heavy clouds gathered ominously together ; fierce sunset lights broke luridly out from the increasing darkness ; the sea, answering to the movements overhead, was lashing itself into fury. But perhaps the chief strength of the painting lay in the feeling it conveyed of repression, as if, through all the visible stir, there was a holding back of worse things : the sun 172 set lights had not yet died out, hope was not over ; how would it end? Had Jean Lafon unconsciously pictured his own life? Who knows ? A heap of large waxy yellow and red bigarreau cherries were temptingly arranged in a green leaf upon the table which was drawn near a little low couchâ\\x80\\x94Louisâ\\x80\\x99 resting-place. It was there that Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes dwelt with a look of infinite tender 172 ness. She thought her brother was asleep, for he lay quite still, this boy of sixteen, who, born a cripple, had passed through childhood without tasting the joyousness of a childâ\\x80\\x99s existence, and now was lengthening outâ\\x80\\x94not growing upâ\\x80\\x94to manhood, the same helpless burden as ever. His eyes were closed, his face turned towards the door ; one hand was under his cheek.URSULE. Though the hazel eyes were hidden, you could see that the face was beautiful, the nose short and straight, the lips rather full, the chin round. Brown hair lifted itself a little from the forehead, and the long curved eyelashes were darker than the hair. Only the colouring and roundness of health was wantâ\\x80\\x99 ing, and even now the usual suffering look was veiled by a half smile flickering tremulously round the mouth. The next instant it broke out unrestrainedly, his eyes opened, and Ursule darted to his side. She knelt down, and laid her cheek against his. â\\x80\\x98 Thou hast had a good sleep, my Louis ; I am so glad !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Not a sleep, but a day-dream. I have been a hundred leagues away.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And left me behind ? â\\x80\\x99 Ursule said, with a little quick re 172 proachful gesture. She could not endure that he should separate himself from her even in his dreams. â\\x80\\x98 We shall see. At all events, I have come back now, and I want to hear how you and Madame got on. Have you been good? Is she still angry with my poor soup?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Noâ\\x80\\x94yesâ\\x80\\x94no ; that is to say, she was angry, but I brought her round in a cloud of dust, and then it was all nearly un 172 done again because I said I liked to look at the sky. How 172 ever, do not be troubled; she is not really vexed. I have promised to lend her the big chair. Oh, Louis ! â\\x80\\x99 Ursule jumped up and clapped her hands delightedly, â\\x80\\x98 I have some 172 thing to tell.â\\x80\\x99 * Ah ? And I too.â\\x80\\x99 * Thou ? Has Madame Sanson been up ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No.â\\x80\\x99 * Not Monsieur, I know : Monsieur is too fat. Pierre Renait?â\\x80\\x9912 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Not a creature.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule pondered. â\\x80\\x98 Tiens, I have it ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, pre 172 sently ; â\\x80\\x98 a letter has come from our father.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98When he left us but yesterday, and I told you no one had been up ! Do letters come of themselves, little wise- head ? â\\x80\\x99 Ursule pretended to pout. â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t like secrets,â\\x80\\x99 said she. 1 Eh bien! find it out. Guess again. No? There, I give you warning I shall make my own bargain ; you shall tell me your news, and perhaps I will tell you mine.â\\x80\\x99 His sister pinched his arm, and called him a usurer. â\\x80\\x98 I have a more generous spirit, and care not for conditions. The day after to-morrow is the great June fete; the principal stations will be in this street, and you will see everything to perfection. There ! Last yearâ\\x80\\x94do you remember ?â\\x80\\x94you were ill, and it was all lost on us.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 So the big chair is for Madame ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes; she has friends who will sit solemnly in the balcony and behold everything.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Has she invited you ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How, I ! To meet her friends ! She called me a little Protestant. To tell you the truth, Louis,â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, draw 172 ing up her head proudly, â\\x80\\x98 I care not greatly for being a Pro 172 testant except when they mock me for it, and thenâ\\x80\\x94I would not be anything else for the world.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Madame has Protestant relations of her own ? â\\x80\\x99 said Louis, letting Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s doctrinal opinions pass for once without com 172 ment ; â\\x80\\x98 you have often told me so.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, there is her sister, and her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s English son, Mon 172 sieur Clement Blunt. She talks of them so much ; she hopes, IURSULE. i3 think, continually, that they will come and see her. Poor Madame ! she says no good thing that ever she hopes for comes. That is terrible, Louis, is it not? Now, to me, it seems that so many good things come just when one wants them most, and does not expect to have themâ\\x80\\x94when matters are at their worst, sometimes ; and my father has been tiresome and horrid for ever so longâ\\x80\\x94you need not shake your head, Louis, I must say it to somebodyâ\\x80\\x94then, all of a sudden, he takes a turn and works at a picture, sells it, gives me some of the money, and we can go on again. And when you are ill, and I am fretting because I have nothing nice to give you, up comes dear old Madame Sanson with her good-natured face, and just the very thing I want pops out from under her apron. Oh, it is wonderful ! One has so many nice surprises in the world ! â\\x80\\x99 Her brightness infected Louis ; his eyes sparkled. â\\x80\\x98 Have you forgotten that it is I who am to give you a sur 172 prise this time?â\\x80\\x99 said he, blithely. â\\x80\\x98 No, no, I have not forgotten that your secret is coming; I am wondering and wondering to myself while I talk. But it is to be very charming, remember. It is to be the best of all, because it comes from you.â\\x80\\x99 Louis smiled gravely, and a little nervously. He put his hand under his pillow, and slowly drew out something which he placed in Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s hand. She looked at it in an ecstasy of wonder and delight. It was a little picture, delicately painted in water-colours, of a young girl caressing her pigeons. One she clasped, and smoothed the soft feathers, while her head was turned towards another, which had just fluttered on her shoulder. It was not difficult to see who had been Louisâ\\x80\\x99 model. Shall I describe14 ONE YEAR. Ursule ? It is time to do so ; and yet hers was just one of those faces which it is almost impossible to realise by description, for the interest lay entirely in expression. She was not even pretty, yet she looked so as she stood with the flush of delighted pride upon her face, her lips slightly parted, her grey eyes sparkling and tender; her whole countenance lit with sweet unselfish sympathy. It was pleasant to see the deep love evidently existing between the young brother and sister : she so entirely wrapped in him that no consciousness of who was represented in the little painting crossed her mind, only wonder at Louisâ\\x80\\x99 surprising genius ; and he showing his affection in the care with which he had fashioned every fold of her simple dark dress, the wave in her hair, the ribbon bound round her head, the graceful poise of her slender figure, the little prettinesses which no stranger would have recognized. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s voice trembled almost into a sob as she laid her hands upon his shoulders, and looked full into his eyes : â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Louis, is it your doing ? Your very, very own ? â\\x80\\x99 For answer he drew down her head and kissed her, and the two whispered gleefully to one another like a pair of little children. â\\x80\\x98 How clever ! How beautiful ! â\\x80\\x99 * Do you really like it?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Like it ! Why, Louis, who could have done it better ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah, you see, who knows ? I may do something yet.â\\x80\\x99 * Has Pierre seen it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, no ! â\\x80\\x99 * What will he say ? â\\x80\\x99 And Ursule drew herself back once more to look at it, and said, after a long scrutiny, quite naively, â\\x80\\x98 She has such a pretty face !â\\x80\\x99 whereupon Louis broke into a peal of laughter so joyousURSULE. and hearty, and unlike his usual quiet amusement, that good Madame Sanson downstairs stopped in her work, smiled for sympathy, and said to her husband, â\\x80\\x98Listen, Jules, mon avii, that is all your little cake.â\\x80\\x99 Monsieur Sanson sighed. â\\x80\\x98 It was delicate,â\\x80\\x99 lie said, â\\x80\\x98 the flavour was ravishing, andâ\\x80\\x94it was the last.â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER II. LOUIS. And I know full well, though I cannot see, How the calmness falls over meadow and tree ; And the carven pinnacles, clear and high, How still they stand in the quiet sky. Der Tod als Freund. prove an excuse for idleness. His mother loved him very dearly, and it is easy to build visionary castles for those we love. He used to talk grandly of the things he would do some day, and of it being not worth while to attend to little things meanwhile. Madame Lafon was ready to believe that she had in her son a great painter, who could leap, whenever he liked, to the highest point of fame. So also thought Marie Laget when she married him. When she diedâ\\x80\\x94eight years afterwardsâ\\x80\\x94she was content to pray passionately that her chil 172 dren might be kept from starvation. Dreams of fame fade quickly if want stands gaunt and grim before the door, and Marie grew bitter when she lost trust in her husband. Had heLOUIS. 17 honestly tried and failed, she would have comforted, and loved, and believed in him the more; but when success was in his powerâ\\x80\\x94when he used it sufficiently to gratify his own wants, his wishes, his pleasures, leaving her and the children to struggle on as they mightâ\\x80\\x94when selfishness was the only motive that stung him to exertion, Marieâ\\x80\\x99s love drifted away from him and centered in the children. For them she toiled day and night, caring nothing for her own suffering and failing health; and just when it seemed as if they could least do without her, she diedâ\\x80\\x94 died, raising herself upon her elbow to give Louis one long, last, yearning kiss. Madame Sanson used often to speak of it in after-days, and never without tears. It was the ending of a life which, to the lookers-on who judged from the same level, seemed unlovely and failing, full of twists, unravellings, and rugged knots, but wherein, it may be, higher Eyes dis 172 cerned the golden thread which beautified the whole. It was very hard to her to go and leave her cripple-boy behind. Almost her last words were to impress upon Ursule the charge she left to her. And it was, in all probability, the remembrance of this which made the girl, childish as she was in other ways, so womanly, almost motherly, in her care of Louis. In this she had never once failed. All the nursery ogres that ever existed were rolled into one by Madame Sanson when she wanted to find a comparison for what was likely to prove the behaviour of Jean Lafon at this juncture; but whether, as she persisted in affirming, he was possessed by the spirit of contradiction, or not, it is true that he certainly disappointed her expectations. He did not desert his children and leave them on her hands; but, on the con 172 trary, he worked harder than he had been known to do before, for several months in succession. He finished off and success- 2j8 ONE YEAR. fully sold two or three original sketches, executed a commission for copying a famous opal-tinted Cuyp, with cows standing in a marsh by a broad canal ; and, having satisfied his conscience by leaving money enough to support the children for a certain time, went off to indulge his love for a roving gipsy life. Ever since that day Ursule and Louis had lived on in the old house. Their father came home from time to timeâ\\x80\\x94they could never calculate whenâ\\x80\\x94sometimes bringing with him a finished picture, but more often painting after his arrival ; providing Ursule with money at most uncertain intervals, and often reducing her to hard shifts. She had a brave, undaunted spirit, and never com 172 plained for herself : but for Louis she often shed bitter tears ; and the delicate boy could not have struggled through it all, had not Madame Sanson with motherly kindness helped poor Ursule in her charge. As for Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, although, to hear her talk, yofi would have supposed her to be the girlâ\\x80\\x99s protector, she was in truth but another burden. If any per 172 son had taken the trouble to set down the services on either side in a debtor and creditor account, Madame must have been credited with unlimited advice upon certain subjects, prominent among which stood the treatment of Louis (whom she had never seen), due contempt for Monsieur Sansonâ\\x80\\x99s cooking qualities, due respect\\' for noble birth, and a just view of the importance of attaining a deportment which was distinguished by her with the title of comme il faut. Ursule, on her side, cleaned Madameâ\\x80\\x99s room, nursed her when she was ill, ran errands for her, and kept a human interest alive in the sad, desolate old heart. It was not, as people say, by any means all love between them. Madame was sharp, and Ursule naughty with every 172 body except Louis : there was plenty of sparring and retort. \\'You seek occasionâ\\x80\\x94you desire to enrage me !â\\x80\\x99 Madame wouldLOUIS. exclaim, stamping her foot and letting her little grey curls quiver with excitement, and then out would pour Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s torrent of indignation. The wonder lay in the rapidity with which the storm would subside. Louis was general peacemaker. What 172 ever tempests vexed the house, from that clear atmosphere of patient love came down, no one quite knew how, all manner of soothing influences and kindly suggestions. I think it must have been the realization of how great a burden he had tes bear which made all the others feel their petty jars and frett so contemptible. His shrinking, sensitive nature, wanting the vigour that is necessary to lead others, still influenced them unconsciously by a pathetic power. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s infinitely stronger character rested confidingly upon his. He possessed the rare gift of a quick, sympathetic imagination, that enabled him almost to identify himself with whoever claimed his interest, and the charm deepened a hundredfold as belonging to one who might so easily have absorbed himself in the contempla 172 tion of his own trials. He never came down-stairs : it was suffering enough for him to move from one room into the other, or out upon the balcony; worse suffering often than Ursule could well bear to see. But he inherited his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s artist-eye, and made pictures out of everything; out of a flower growing on the steep, red-tiled roof opposite; out of the gloomy arched entrance and quaint gables of another house ; out of the shop beside it, filled with creamy ivory carvings; out of the country-people passing below, with shrill-pitched, merry voices, on their way to the church, to the market, to the shops. In the keen, clear French atmosphere all the coloursâ\\x80\\x94red, blue, yellowâ\\x80\\x94stood sharply out against the background of white houses ; and on fÃªte or market days, when the peasant-women noured in num- 2â\\x80\\x94220 ONE YEAR. bers into the old town, and chatted and gesticulated while their poultry cackled, black-eyed girls in snowy caps, short petti 172 coats, and stout shoes, carrying heavy triangular baskets of fish upon their backs, older women here and there among them, still preserving the picturesque dress of ancient Normandy, and conspicuous for their towering muslin caps, chains and crosses, bright kerchiefs, and striped aprons, Louisâ\\x80\\x99 birdâ\\x80\\x99s-eye- view of life was animated. For other things, which he could never see, he depended upon Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s descriptions, which she had learned to render as faithfully as any landscape-painter. Nothing passed un 172 heeded that might be stored up for Louisâ\\x80\\x99 amusement. Some 172 times she would go to the cathedral, and return to him with quiet, grave pictures of the niched figures which looked peace 172 fully down upon the world below, from out of their fretted canopies; or, better still, of shadowy nooks into which she had penetrated, sombre, solemn depths of dark stone where exquisite carvings were mouldering away, and the grass grow 172 ing up unheeded round them. How patiently, how lovingly, skilled hands had toiled over these carvings, Ursule would think sadly ; and for what ? They were crumbling into decay, unseen, unpraised : even the sun was shut out from them, and all the careful labour was thrown away. She took back to Louis a pathetic picture of one or two such neglected corners, until he took quite an interest in them. He used to eagerly entreat her to go there, to pull up the tall weeds, to bring him back more exact descriptions. In truth, although he could not have accounted in words for the attraction these hidden nooks possessed for him, it was that he unconsciously traced in them an allegory of his own life, and that it comforted him to hear how the great, simple-minded builders of old knew, that everyLOUIS. 21 spot in Godâ\\x80\\x99s house should be beautiful, though it might be that mortal eye would never rest upon it, and that, where no other worship could be offered, the stones at least should cry out His praise. Besides the cathedral, there was the sea. Louis knew all about that. On stormy nights he could hear the distant wail of the waves. Ursule used to tell him how the cliffs looked grey and mysterious in the twilight, or brightened into rosy flushes when the setting sun left a glorious trail upon the waters. He liked to hear of the varying aspect of the green waves; whether they rolled in with a motion, calm, mighty, undisturbed, and suffered the fishing-boats to spread their tawny canvas and rock peacefully upon the surface; or whether they scattered them far and wide, the angry breakers hurling themselves against the pier, and whitening it with clouds of driven foam. He liked especially to hear how, in the midst of all this turmoil, a little black speck would appear out of the mist which mingled sky and sea together, and, drawing nearer and nearer, would hold on its undaunted way through the great waves and against the opposing wind, until the steamer passed the pier into the harbour, and poured forth her freight of weary, pale-faced passengers. It was a great amusement to Louis when sometimes afterwards Ursule was able to point out to him the very people as they walked along sight-seeing, sure to spend a certain time in looking at the ivory carvings opposite. All this Ursule could do, and she did it faithfully. But the part of Louisâ\\x80\\x99 existence, the want to which she could not mini 172 ster, was an almost morbid longing to lessen the burden of his own helplessness. Ursule set Madame Sanson to scold him by the hour in vain. He acquiesced in all she said, but the long-22 ONE YEAR. ing remained as strong as ever. He could not bear to think of the dead weight he was to his sister ; he knew much better than she thought how hard it was sometimes for her to get what she wanted for him, but he would not grieve her by showing that he knew; that would only, as he was well aware, add tenfold to her trouble. But this it was which often, more than pain, made him restless; this it was that led him to toil painfully over the paper and paints, or lumps of clay which Pierre RenaÃ®t, the son of the famous clay-moulder, brought to himâ\\x80\\x94 toil till his hands trembled, and the hot flush came out on his cheek, and Ursule was ready to cry for vexation. How badly she behaved to Pierre on these occasions ! It was all his faultâ\\x80\\x94 all ! He had no sense, no discretion, no perception ; he could not be trusted for a moment to see what was destruction to Louis ! The poor lad knew not what to do; for this little brown fury had before now been as gracious as possible to him when he had, by the very same means, succeeded in wiling away some hours of pain. Pierre always mounted the stairs trembling; there was no knowing the mood in which he might find his queen. And it was a little hard when father, mother, and a hundred besides would have scouted with horror the idea of his falling in love with the daughter of Jean Lafon, the vagabond painter, to be so utterly scorned and made light of by the damsel herself. He thought mournfully that Ursule never seemed to consider him at all, except as a means of amusement for her beloved Louis. Nor did she. When he was entertaining, and Louis was bright, Pierre had a good chance of falling in for a smile, which set his heart bounding for an hour. If, unfortunately, Louis was weary and depressed, then Pierre was chased uncere 172 moniously from the room, and left to make his way dismallyLOUIS. 2 3 down the stairs, and to meditate upon the uncertainty of womenâ\\x80\\x99s tempers. It was all very naughty of Ursule; but then, as Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny complained, her manners were as yet by no means comme il faut. When, however, Pierre Renait ventured to mount to his friendâ\\x80\\x99s room on the morning after the conversation between the brother and sister related in the preceding chapter, he found Ursule radiant. She flung down the work on which she was employed, and jumped up to meet him, clapping her hands. â\\x80\\x98 How long you have been in coming, Pierre ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed. â\\x80\\x98 I have wanted you ever so much.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Wanted me, Mademoiselle?â\\x80\\x99 stammered the young man, colouring from surprise and pleasure. â\\x80\\x98 It is partly owing to you, and it is delightful ! Look at Louis ; does he not look well ? And he has done wonders ! â\\x80\\x99 Show it to Pierre, Louis ; he deserves really to see it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She thinks a great deal too much of it, Pierre,â\\x80\\x99 said Louis, apologetically ; â\\x80\\x98 it is a very little thing, and I remember you saw me beginning it But you know I have done so little. Is there any chance ? Will it do ? â\\x80\\x99 * Do ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Ursule with indignation. But Louis was less sanguine. He watched his friend closely, with painful anxiety, aware of his own deficiencies, and jealous of the notion that Pierre might pretend to admire it for friend 172 shipâ\\x80\\x99s sake. He had not the least idea that there might be another reason to blind his eyes. â\\x80\\x98 Why, it is beautiful ! â\\x80\\x99 cried the young man, warmly ; â\\x80\\x98 it is Mademoiselle to the life. Louis, lucky fellow ! you will make your fortune ! â\\x80\\x99 Louis shut his eyes and sank back upon his pillows, content. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s smile deepened. If Pierre had ventured to think dif-24 ONE YEAR. ferently, there is no knowing what would have become of him ; but there was genuine honesty in his tone, and the girl triumphed. â\\x80\\x98I told you so, Louis,â\\x80\\x99 she said; â\\x80\\x98but of course Monsieur Pierre is a better judge. And we have to thank him for much. Indeed,â\\x80\\x99 she added, turning to him with a pretty little air of dignity which was new to her, â\\x80\\x98 we are very, very much obliged to you.â\\x80\\x99 Pierreâ\\x80\\x99s head swam ; such unwonted graciousness quite took away his breath ; he felt as he had not done since he had the fever, five years before. Yet it seemed to him as if it only mounted Ursule on a higher pedestal, and left him further off than ever â\\x80\\x98 If Mademoiselle would like,â\\x80\\x99 he said timidly, â\\x80\\x98 I might assist her in offering the little picture to those whose opinion is better worth having. Many, as you know, come to my father about works of art; and although it is not our branch exactly, Iâ\\x80\\x94 I thinkâ\\x80\\x94I am sure it would soon find a purchaser.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I do not want it to be sold,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, coming down from her heights and pouting a little. â\\x80\\x98 I want to keep it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Do not listen to her,â\\x80\\x99 interrupted Louis eagerly ; â\\x80\\x98 but thank you a hundred thousand times, Pierre. Take it with youâ\\x80\\x94yes, by all meansâ\\x80\\x94I think, oh, if you can bring me back a few francs, and let me feel that Iâ\\x80\\x94I have earned them !â\\x80\\x94Ursule, I shall not be a log upon you any more.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If I might â\\x80\\x99 hurriedly began Pierre ; he was going to say that if he only might buy it himself it would be the choicest bit of treasure he had ever possessed, when Ursule interrupted him: â\\x80\\x98 I insistâ\\x80\\x94Pierre, I insist that it is not sold to any one who cannot appreciate it properly, who is not charming. I will never speak to you again, if you let it go otherwise. Do you understand ? â\\x80\\x99LOUIS. 2 5 â\\x80\\x98Yes, Mademoiselle, I understand you,â\\x80\\x99 said the young man, humbly. â\\x80\\x98 And you promise ? â\\x80\\x99 Pierre hesitated. â\\x80\\x98 I promise,â\\x80\\x99 he said at last, â\\x80\\x98 that no one shall have it who will not value it with his whole heart.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That is right!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Ursule, gleefully. â\\x80\\x98My Louis, what would you do if you had not me to make conditions? And Pierre is really excellent ; what can we do for him ? Tiens, I have an idea! He shall see the fÃªte to-morrow from our balcony. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny has her little party, and why should not we have our festivity above ? You will come ?â\\x80\\x94that is right. But I shall send you away now ; Louis is tired, and must sleep. Au revoir, Monsieur Pierre : take great care of our treasure.â\\x80\\x99 Pierre went away in a whirl of delight. She had never treated him so confidentially before, never had been so kind, never, he thought, looked so bewitching. He held his charge tightâ\\x80\\x94 Ursule and her pigeons, which he was never to part with, though he spent his last sou upon its purchase. Nevertheless, in spite of his head being turned, he had enough sense re 172 maining to understand that she would not be satisfied with his being the owner. He went, therefore, at once to an old man who worked for his father, and occasionally executed commis 172 sions on his own account, who knew also something of the value of pictures, and would be able to give an opinion as to whatâ\\x80\\x94to ordinary mortals who did not know Ursuleâ\\x80\\x94would be the worth of Louisâ\\x80\\x99 maiden. He found MaÃ®tre Moreau sitting in a stuffy little back room, engaged upon some delicate moulding, and in no good humour at being interrupted. He was surly mannered, and his greeting of Pierre was enough to daunt a less ardent inquirer. But Pierre in the presence of20 ONE YEAR. Ursule, and Pierre with the outer world, were very different beings. \\'Good morning, Moreau; I want a word of advice.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I could give you plenty, only you would not take it,â\\x80\\x99 mut 172 tered the old man, crossly. â\\x80\\x98 Who knows ? Letâ\\x80\\x99s hear it, at any rate.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Take off these fripperies,â\\x80\\x99 touching with his lean forefinger some little ornaments rather ostentatiously displayed on Pierreâ\\x80\\x99s watch-chain ; â\\x80\\x98 go home, learn to bake clay, and not to disturb people when they are occupied.â\\x80\\x99 Pierre laughed. \\'Great thanks for small civilities. How 172 ever, those are not what I require just at present. Just look up, if you please, from that sticky stuff, and tell me for how much this little water-colour ought to sell. There,â\\x80\\x99 he con 172 tinued, holding it at armâ\\x80\\x99s length, and contemplating it with the deepest admiration, â\\x80\\x98if you are honest, you will acknow 172 ledge you have not seen so gracefÃ¹l a bit of work for a long time.â\\x80\\x99 Moreau glanced up quickly for an instant under his shaggy eyebrows. â\\x80\\x98 I â\\x80\\x9911 give you half-a-napoleon for it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Will you, indeed?â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed the young man indignantly; â\\x80\\x98who told you that it was for sale?â\\x80\\x94to you of all people in the world.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If it is not for sale,â\\x80\\x99 said Moreau, coolly continuing his work, â\\x80\\x98 there is no occasion for asking mÂ¿ what it is worth.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98But there is occasion, I tell you. Allez! I shall lose all patience presently. Moreau,â\\x80\\x99 he went on, changing his tone, â\\x80\\x98 oblige me by informing me what a connoisseur in these matters would pay for such another as this? Not this itself, you understandâ\\x80\\x94for, as I have already said, it is not for saleâ\\x80\\x94butLOUIS. 27 one of the same style. Then I will depart, on my word of honour.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Depart, then, in the name of all that is provoking ! And as to your sketch, if you poke it under the nose of every fool you meet as perseveringly as you have poked it under mine, at the end of a twelvemonth you may meet with one big enough to give you a napoleon for it. â\\x80\\x98 The old curmudgeon ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Pierre, flinging himself out of the room indignantly. â\\x80\\x98 But I know his ways, and if he offered me ten francs for it, it is worth twice that ; I will take them twenty francs to-morrow. What will Ursule say? I must be careful; she is so quick and so proud that every time she looks at me I shall think she has found out my secret; and it she did, the storm would be frightful ; I should be compelled to restore it. Her looks sometimes seem as if they would wither one up ; and yet how gentle she can be ! Louis has made her eyes here like doveâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, and so they are to him. But I have heard that women are always strange to those they like ; I hope it is so, for,â\\x80\\x99 concluded poor Pierre, with a sigh, â\\x80\\x98she is strange enough to me at times. Yet to-dayâ\\x80\\x94who knows ?â\\x80\\x94to-day may be the beginning : so courage, my friend, courage ; nothing is to be done without that.â\\x80\\x99 It is very easy work to call for oneâ\\x80\\x99s weapons, but of no possible use if, when they come, they are allowed to slip out of oneâ\\x80\\x99s fingers. That is just where Pierreâ\\x80\\x99s courage oozed away on the following morning when he mounted the oak staircase, with two little gold pieces clasped in his hand, and the picture safely locked away at home in a box. He began the ascent valiantly, two stairs at a time; and then he was seized with mortal dread of the encounter, and of Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes looking through him and bringing his little fraud to light ; so that he28 ONE YEAR. dragged his steps as slowly after him as if he had been a criminal on the way to receive his sentence. Poor Pierre ! Certainly his courtship was not running upon easy wheels. There was his mother, who had been reproaching him all the morning for deserting his own home on the day of the fÃªte, and taunting him with his fondness for a little heretic, who had neither family, riches, nor even good looks to recommend her. There was his father, to whom nobody had ever dared to breathe a word of such monstrous behaviour on the part of his son ; there was his married sister, who lectured like her mother, and the unmarried one, who made a mock at his confidences. There was Ursule herself treating him much as an eastern princess would treat a slave; and finally there was his own heart dragged in opposite directions. Pierre could only com 172 fort himself with the idea that, with so many obstacles in the way, he was every day more closely approximating to the heroes of romance. He reflected what they would have done under the circumstances. Having arranged his hair very care 172 fully before starting, it was not convenient to make any frantic attempts at tearing it, and he could only relieve himself by a tremendous thump upon the chest, which certainly had not the effect of making him feel more comfortable when he found himself in the room with the brother and sister. It was Louisâ\\x80\\x99 turn to welcome him. Ursule was in the balcony, leaning over the railing, and watching the preparations in the street below. â\\x80\\x98 You are just in time, Pierre,â\\x80\\x99 said the boy with a smile. â\\x80\\x98 I want to be helped out to see the gay sights which Ursule reports. Ursule, here is Pierre.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 So I hear,â\\x80\\x99 said the girl carelessly, without turning her head. â\\x80\\x98 Good day, Pierre.â\\x80\\x99LOUIS. 29 She was in one of her moodsâ\\x80\\x94Pierre knew it in a moment by her attitude ; but the talisman he held in his hand gave him unusual confidence. He knelt down by Louisâ\\x80\\x99 couch. * See here, my friend,â\\x80\\x99 he said in an under-tone, * are you content with your earnings ? â\\x80\\x99 Louis looked at him with open eyes. â\\x80\\x98 Mine, all that ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You are pleased ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Twenty francs ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What are you two whispering about? â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, standing on the window-sill. â\\x80\\x98 Do you not know that it is very rude to whisper? Well, well, no fine excuses; do not flatter yourselves I care about your secrets. How could you tear yourself away from your gay friends, Monsieur Pierre?â\\x80\\x94you have a better view from your own apartments.â\\x80\\x99 * Mademoiselle forgets, perhaps, that she invited me,â\\x80\\x99 said Pierre, confused, mortified, and piqued, all in one. â\\x80\\x98No, I remember; but I certainly never thought you would have come.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98How silly you are, both of you,â\\x80\\x99 interrupted Louis im 172 patiently ; â\\x80\\x98 and, Ursule, all this time you ought to be thanking him. See ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah, he has sold the picture already;â\\x80\\x99 and Ursule clapped her hands gleefully : â\\x80\\x98 think of that ! Why, I never gained money like this.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How quickly you have got itâ\\x80\\x94so much too ! Pierre, is it really true ; is it all right ? â\\x80\\x99 The guilty Pierre coloured and stammered ; but, as his dan 172 ger, so his protection came from the quarter where he least expected it. Ursule answered for him tenderly. â\\x80\\x98 My Louis, you will always distrust yourself. I knew how it3 o ONE YEAR. would be; I knew what your beautiful little painting was worth. But, Pierre, I vexed you just now when you have been so good. You did not heed it, did you? You know how my tongue gallops away with me ; you ought to pity me, indeed,â\\x80\\x99 she con 172 tinued with a comical little shrug, â\\x80\\x98 for what am I to do ? When I am cross, I canâ\\x80\\x99t scold Louis, and it is so stupid to scold one 172 self.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You should never do that,â\\x80\\x99 said Pierre, with a little blunder 172 ing attempt at gallantry. â\\x80\\x98No? Well, I am not so sure; but it is the pleasantest doctrine. Come,â\\x80\\x99 she said, shaking off her momentary gravity, â\\x80\\x98 we must lead out Louis. I hear the music in the distance.â\\x80\\x99 Between them, the boy was half helped, half lifted, to the chair which his sister had put for him, and the three ensconced themselves in the little iron balcony to watch for the approach 172 ing processionâ\\x80\\x94Pierre holding a great umbrella so as not only to shade Ursule, but conceal himself, and fervently hoping that no busy friends below would look up, recognise, and report to his father the reason why he had deserted his motherâ\\x80\\x99s guests. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s feelings on this fÃªte-day were a mass of mingled sunshine and shadow. The day was delicious, fresh, keen, and sunny. Louis was wellâ\\x80\\x94unusually well, and in his highest spirits. Their worldly prospects, with this altogether unex 172 pected and, to them, apparently inexhaustible source of wealth opening out, were peculiarly prosperous. Why was it not all sunshine ? She had intended that it should be, and yet, foolish child, I am almost ashamed to write it of her, it sounds so naughty and discontented, the truth must be told, that she was annoyed because Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny had not invited her to her reception in the salon. She wanted very much to know whatLOUIS. 3 1 ladies talked about to one another. She had led a strangely independent, unconventional life, which had at least left her ignorant of the thousand wearisome common-places which make a part of every personâ\\x80\\x99s existence. In her simplicity she wanted to know about them. She would have liked, only for one ten minutes, to have sat humbly behind the three old people down 172 stairs, and heard how they spoke in the unknown world of which she thought so often ; and she was very fierce with Madame for denying her this pleasure. â\\x80\\x98May I come down, Madame, just to see your friends?â\\x80\\x99 she had said innocently, when she had worked through the early morning, shaken and dusted and vigorously furbished up the old things in Madameâ\\x80\\x99s apartment, and dragged the heavy great chair down the stairs, bump, bump, at every step. All this she had done, and then she asked for her crumb of reward. But no, certainly/ Madame said, without a touch of com 172 punction in her voice. â\\x80\\x98 It would not be comme il faut,â\\x80\\x99 she had gone on to explain. She, the poor artistâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, could not be invited to meet Madame Grignon and Madame Larousse, who had once moved in a circle of society so high that it was not possible for Ursule even to reach it in imagination. â\\x80\\x98I should not hurt them,â\\x80\\x99 the girl said, defiantly ; and she had gone away with indignation in her heart. It was this strange worldly problem, which had never before come in her way, that troubled her thoughts as she sat silent under Pierreâ\\x80\\x99s umbrella in the balcony. She was not good enough to meet Madameâ\\x80\\x99s friends. But why ? The young republican frowned and bit her lips at the idea of the balcony from which she was shut outâ\\x80\\x94the bal 172 cony down below, in which the three old women, faded and wizened, sat clinging to the shadow of their fancied dignities3 2 ONE YEAR. and solemnly eating chocolate. It was far more pleasant to look at the group over their heads. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s graceful little lithe figure in the unfailing dark dress, it is true, but with snowy collar and cuffs to freshen it, and the ribbon fillet round her head; Pierre, dark-eyed, sallow, animated; and the pale earnest face of the lame boy, with watchful eyes, keenly seeking a new excitement; all set off by the bright bit of scarlet cloth which, Protestants as they were, good Madame Sanson insisted upon hanging over the balcony. Some of the neighbours, standing at the door of their houses, looked up, smiled and nodded with a good-humoured shrug at sight of Pierre, who, reddening as he caught their glances, kept back as far under the shadow of the umbrella as he could, while Ursule, equally unconscious of him and of them, clasped her hands upon the balcony railing, and looked out with eyes which were trying to pierce that new problem which the world had just placed before her. The brilliant procession came slowly down the street, pausing every now and then at the different stations, the altars decked with green boughs which had been erected in its course. There were soldiers, and banners, and canopies of bright fluttering rib 172 bons carried by young girls ; there was a body of the newly confirmed, the girls in their white dresses and veils; there were the ecclesiastics in their gorgeous many-coloured vestments; and with the guns, and the music, and the moments when all the bystanders simultaneously knelt in the street, it could not fail to be impressive. Louis watched it intently, more intently than either of his companions, and sank back with a sigh of relief as the last straggler disappeared down the street and Madame Sanson came bustling into the room. â\\x80\\x98Was there ever such a fÃªte? Did you think there could be anything half so beautiful upon earth? That little fat man nextLOUIS. 33 monseigneur waddled frightfully, it is true; but then what would you have?â\\x80\\x94they cannot all be angels. Ah, I remember going to a fÃªte myself, all in white and lovely. They would not have me now, though I flatter myself I am a great deal better inside than I used to be. All the same, that will not serve for the angels down below here: one must have a figure and a com 172 plexion to make any show among them. And there was that silly little Annette, with her wreath all awry. Gabrielle Drouet was the most charming of them allâ\\x80\\x94not a hair out of place, not a fold disturbed, and moving like a queen. I called Sanson to see it; but the soup was just simmering, and he would not leave it even for a moment. What will become of him ?â\\x80\\x94that is the question that rests in my throat like a bone. What will become of him,â\\x80\\x99 continued Madame Sanson, puckering her rosy round face into as grave an expression as it could be brought to assume, â\\x80\\x98 if he cannot leave his cooking when all the holiness in our town is passing by? It is frightful ! What dost thou think, little one? â\\x80\\x99 Ursule was still leaning over the heavy iron railing, and Madame Sanson took it for granted that she was absorbed in tracking the course by which the passing splendour had disap 172 peared. She was the more petrified when the girl, without turning her head or changing her position, answered pettishly, â\\x80\\x98 I think he was quite right.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ursule ! â\\x80\\x99 said Louis. In a moment she was kneeling by his side. â\\x80\\x98I canâ\\x80\\x99t think what has got into me to-day,â\\x80\\x99she said penitently; â\\x80\\x98I am always saying what is wrong. Dear Madame, I know it is beautiful to you : I did not mean to vex you. I will go and preach to Mon 172 sieur for an hour, if you would like it. But, my Louis,â\\x80\\x99 laying her brown cheek against his white one, and whispering, â\\x80\\x98it does 334 ONE YEAR. not satisfy me. Is it wicked, do you think, to be different from other people ? Every one else looked so pleased.â\\x80\\x99 * I thought it beautiful,â\\x80\\x99 said the boy, with a sigh. â\\x80\\x98 And so it must have been. It is all my fault ; and these troublesome fancies, which will come, come. You donâ\\x80\\x99t have them because you are good, and when I am quite close to you they fly away from me also. Hush ! you are looking tired ; we will lift you in.â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER III. ON THE QUAI. We live not in our moments or our years; The present we fling from us as the rind Of some sweet future. R. C. Trench. |HREE days after the fÃªte, Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny and Ursule held a grave conference in the salon of the? former lady. Louis, patiently lying on his couch up-stairs, wondered to what it could relate, since it had been heralded by certain signs of importance which were quite unprecedented. Madame Sanson had ascended the black staircase as the bearer of a small elegantly folded missive, in which Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny prayed Mademoiselle Ursule Lafon to do her the favour to descend, she being desirous to consult her upon an affair of moment. Ursule went off into a fit of merry laughter, when with some pains she had succeeded in deciphering this formal document; Madame Sanson, on the contrary, generally full of contempt for her lodgerâ\\x80\\x99s little weaknesses, fidgeted, looked grave, and finally scolded Ursule roundly for her want of pro 172 per respect. * But she sees me every day : why should she take all this trouble ? â\\x80\\x99 sâ\\x80\\x9423 5 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 That is nothing to thee. People do not take trouble with 172 out reason ; leave that to her. Since she desires it, be serious and steady.â\\x80\\x99 She was so evidently anxious on the subject, that Ursule schooled herself into sobriety, and went down-stairs prepared, as she whispered to Louis, to drop three unexceptionable curt 172 sies, and not speak unless she was spoken to. But, in spite of her words, the girl could not help feeling a little curious, and Louis still more so. He and Madame Sanson remained in the room together after Ursule had obediently descended, his old friend sitting with her mouth resolutely pursed up, as if the secret were ready to fly out of it at a momentâ\\x80\\x99s notice. Per- , ceiving this, he abstained from questioning, and went on sketching after some scarcely formed fancy with a bit of char 172 coal which he held in his hand. He had passed a night of suffering, and dark rims round his eyes made them look unnaturally large. Madame Sanson could not withdraw her own from the calm pure young face, and with her head still full of angels would have been scarcely astonished to see him transformed into one before her. She had always stoutly maintained, to the intense scandal of the more orthodox among her friends, that he was as good as any saint ; but, this after 172 noon, she placed him among the angels. He meanwhile, quite unconscious, was meditating in a quiet orderly wayâ\\x80\\x94which, partly from natural temperament and partly from the long discipline of suffering, was as unlike as possible to his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s wayward, roving imaginingsâ\\x80\\x94upon Ursule and the restlessness she had lately displayed. Thinking it just possible that Madame Sanson might throw light upon the subject, he asked her whether she had noticed it. The old woman was terribly taken aback by this question, which placed her secret in serious jeopardy.ON THE QUAI. 37 â\\x80\\x98What is that you sayâ\\x80\\x94restless ? Well, well, it is possible : girls are often so. It fatigues them to be always staying and moping in the same place. She wants a change ; she ought to go away for a little distraction.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Go away ! â\\x80\\x99 repeated Louis, with a shiver, â\\x80\\x98 go away from me ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes, yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame quickly, â\\x80\\x98for a little time, you know, that is all. What will you do when she wants to get married ? A young girl like her wonâ\\x80\\x99t be content to live up here always. Perhaps that may be at the bottom of her contrary ways now.â\\x80\\x99 Louis laughed out at this, a boyish laugh of disbelief. â\\x80\\x98No?â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, sagaciously. â\\x80\\x98Well, well, we shall see, we shall see; stranger things happen. Now, I could tell you something about something which would surprise youâ\\x80\\x94there, as if I had not as nearly as possible let out all Madameâ\\x80\\x99s in 172 tentions ! Ah ! what is coming to me. It keeps dropping out from my mouth as if I had a mouthful of peas ; and in a general way, though I may be an old fool, it is certain no one can accuse me of over-talking. I must descend, I must indeed, or it will be out before I know it, as surely as a chick from the shell.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, no ; sit there, where I can see you, and you need not speak much. Only tell meâ\\x80\\x94ought Ursule to go away? Am I selfish?â\\x80\\x99 Madame Sanson rapidly nodded her head in answer to the first question, and shook it with greater vehemence at the secondâ\\x80\\x94the only means of expression which she felt remained to her. Louisâ\\x80\\x99 brows contacted, and the sweet young face looked troubled. He half raised himself on his arm, and spoke rapidly and with some agitation : â\\x80\\x98 Dear Madame Sanson, you know our circumstances ; no oneONE YEAR. knows them better than you who have been so good to us. And you know about young girls, what is right, what they should be. For me it does not matter; wherever I was it would be the same : I can but lie here and be a burden, I suppose. But we wonâ\\x80\\x99t speak of thatâ\\x80\\x94you shake your head ; and we will conclude that I have nothing to do with the affair â\\x80\\x94only about Ursule. Ah, Madame, it has been so hard for her to have no mother, no father even,â\\x80\\x99 added the lad in a hesitating voice, â\\x80\\x98 and to be sacrificed here to me. How can she learn all the things women ought to know?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She is too independent for a woman ; that is true,â\\x80\\x99 returned Madame Sanson, continuing to shake her head, as if by this means she had found a vent for her feelings. â\\x80\\x98 And yet, how can she be otherwise ? â\\x80\\x99 Â£ Mademoiselle ought to be with other women ;â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, decisively. â\\x80\\x98 It is good, therefore, for her to be with Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny,â\\x80\\x99 Louis said, after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s pause. Then with a half smile, â\\x80\\x98 But she will not submit herself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Her spirit will be broken some day, without doubt ; it is not intended that a woman should have spirit.â\\x80\\x99 \\'No? My poor Ursule! Must it be broken? Should it not rather be curbed and trained ? â\\x80\\x99 \\'All very fine, Monsieur Louis, but who is to do it? You can make those little bits of paper take what colouring you please ; but a girlâ\\x80\\x99s heart !â\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s another thing.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I know,â\\x80\\x99 said the boy sadly. â\\x80\\x98 But, dear Madame, think of all she has had against her ! Who has she to guide her ? How can I help her ? What will become of her when â\\x80\\x99 Louis stopped. Madame looked at him reverently. â\\x80\\x98 One would think you were ever so much older,â\\x80\\x99 said she.ON THE QUAI. 39 He did not answer her for a moment ; then it was to say with a faint smile, â\\x80\\x98 Perhaps my life is gathered into fewer years.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98She wonâ\\x80\\x99t be forsaken,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame heartily, the tears standing in her kind old eyes ; â\\x80\\x98 the good God will take care of you and of her to the end, never doubt it : you might be Pro 172 testants fifty times over before they would get me to believe anything different. There now, donâ\\x80\\x99t talk any more, but try to go to sleep. I hear Sanson calling me, and I must go down all those back-tormenting stairs. How I wish we had a nice com 172 pact little staircase instead ! Donâ\\x80\\x99t be thinking yourself into a headache : there will be good in the end for all you poor young things, heretics or not,â\\x80\\x99 added the old woman in a panting whisper as she descended the stairs, taking each step heavily with the same foot, â\\x80\\x98 Saints preserve us, what would PÃ¨re Roget say if he heard me ! â\\x80\\x99 Louis did not obey his old friendâ\\x80\\x99s injunctions, and the dark shade under his eyes grew darker, as he thought, thought, thought of Ursule, her faults and her lovableness. Pain and weariness had been the teachers sent to train his mind when of other training there was little. Long ago, young as he was, life had stood out before him as no problem, but part of a great wholeâ\\x80\\x94something not only to be accepted, but used. No one, not even Ursule, knew what the patience had cost him, which appeared by others to be worn so easily that it scarcely seemed like patience at all, but rather perfect contentment. No one knew how, through all the weariness and depression of pain, hope would continually spring up with some of the vigour which is inseparable from boyhoodâ\\x80\\x94how resolutely the brave young spirit had striven to put it by, to wrestle with his long 172 ings, to fit himself to the cross, and to accept it as a blessing. Ursule believed there was never any one so good ; but, with all4Â° ONE YEAR. her love and admiration, it seemed to her that she and Louis could never look at life from the same level. To her it was like a veiled beautiful figure standing in the distance, with a smiling face and a lap full of treasures, holding those bright future years which were to come dancing and go out dancing, to make room for others only more beautiful still. And though she longed vaguely to be good, and liked good people and good deeds, it was a dreamy kind of longing, very far removed from any real perception of what that goodness should be, ot the daily struggle, the self-denial, the patience, the thankful heart Temper and patience failed often enough now, when some little passage at arms with Madame crossed her will, and she scarcely professed to be dutiful to her father. She held her religion because it was the religion of the family ; but, as far as any higher motive went, she would as soon have held anything else, and her taste preferred the bright and gorgeous ceremonial of the Church of the country to the cold and unadorned service held once a week in the â\\x80\\x98 Temple.â\\x80\\x99 Yet, though so much in her character seemed anchorless, her nature was not one to be very readily led. She was somewhat reticent in her attachments, and jealous of the smallest attempt at coercion. Loving, warm 172 hearted, generous, faithful, and true, she was also wilful, proud, passionate, and impatient, and as yet deficient in those princi 172 ples which only could give hope that the brighter side of her character would in time predominate. Louisâ\\x80\\x99 meditations came near some of these conclusionsâ\\x80\\x94 painfully near, it seemed; for with a sigh he passed his hand over his forehead as if his task had been too heavy for him, and lay languidly back, feeling relief in the soft summer air which stole in at the window, cool and refreshing, from the sea. Without the breeze the day would have been oppressively sultry. ThereON THE QUAI. 41 was a drone of insects, an occasional rumble of a cart, a sup. pressed murmur of street sounds. Through all these he began to detect a high-pitched note or two, gradually becoming more shrill, which assured him that the interview down-stairs was not altogether of a peaceful nature. He listened as intently as he could to the unintelligible sounds. A quarrel between Madame and Ursule was, as has been said, no uncommon event; but he felt unreasonably impatient at its happening now, when he had just been longing for Ursule to be more gentle with Madame. By-and-by he fancied that the voices grew more composed; nevertheless it was evident that an altercation of some kind had taken place, and though he roused himself to give his unfailing smile of welcome to Ursule when, more slowly than usual, she came up the stairs and into the room, his face wore an anxious and wearied expression which she perceived in a moment. She did not, however, at once allude to it, but asked what had become of Madame Sanson. â\\x80\\x98 She stayed as long as she could.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She has tired you, then, Louis ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Not at all,â\\x80\\x99 said he, putting on a comic air of dignity; â\\x80\\x98we talked philosophy, Madame and I, and it was very improving.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule shook her head. â\\x80\\x98 When I go away from you, every 172 thing goes wrong.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, the vanity â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, no; it is as I say, is it not?â\\x80\\x99 She spoke so imploringly that Louis glanced wonderingly in her face. He put his thin hand into hers. â\\x80\\x98 There is no need for me to tell you, my Ursule, that with you here everything is better.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I said so, I said so,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed she, laughing and crying at once. â\\x80\\x98We will always be together-; no one can place your42 ONE YEAR. pillows like me; no one can read or do anything; no one shall ! â\\x80\\x99 She fluttered about him as she spoke, putting some of her words into practice, but so absently that Louis underwent a good deal of discomfort in the process, and would have preferred his pillows being left as Madame had arranged them. He had not the heart to say so, however, and patiently bore the inflictionâ\\x80\\x94 the more so, because every moment he expected something to be told him which might explain her disjointed words and actions; and she was at all times so ready to pour her little confidences into his ear, and to treasure the veriest trifles for his amusement, that it seemed unnecessary to question her. Nevertheless, to his wonder, she said not a word about the conversation down 172 stairs, but rather seemed by a restless flow of little inconsequent speeches, and by an apparent incapability of sitting still, to be bent upon warding off any reference to the subject. Louis watched and waited until he felt almost a shrinking difficulty in touching upon what she so persistently avoided. â\\x80\\x98 Ursule â\\x80\\x99 he began, at last. * Hark ! did you hear anything ? I must run dovvn-stairs and see whether Madame does not want me.â\\x80\\x99 She was gone before he could stop her; and when she came back it was in a great bustle, to say that she was going as far as the harbour to fetch something for Madame. Louis was not to be put off - again. He caught her by the sleeve, held her fast, and asked with an amused face whether her going at once was of such importance. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s truthfulness barred her from an evasive answer. â\\x80\\x98As to thatâ\\x80\\x94no; but I have really promised to go there this afternoon.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, you shall go, but not this very moment. I have neverON THE QUAI. 43 heard why you were summoned with all that ceremonial to Madame, and I am frightfully curious.â\\x80\\x99 Louis watched for an answer in vain, for his sister stood silent â\\x80\\x98 Is anything wrong ? â\\x80\\x99 he asked anxiously. â\\x80\\x98No, no, indeed !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Only you would rather tell me nothing about it. Is it so, Ursule ? â\\x80\\x99 She glanced quickly at him to discover whether he was hurt by her silence, but meeting only a look of unbroken trust, said quietly, â\\x80\\x98 I do not know how I can ask it, but it is true that I shall be very grateful to you if you will not say anything to me. Madame wanted to ask a question, andâ\\x80\\x94and I answered it ; that really was all.â\\x80\\x99 She spoke in a constrained, measured voice, very unlike her 172 self ; but she could not have done otherwise. She had shared every thought with Louis since babyhood, until now, and she was sufficiently unreasonable to feel sore and annoyed with both Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny and their good old landlady, for having plotted together the little scheme which, she was ashamed to remember, had seemed for a few moments so bright and enticing. Louis answered hesitatingly, â\\x80\\x98 Butâ\\x80\\x94you did not quarrel with her ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No; why?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I thought your voices sounded loud. â\\x80\\x98 Only Madameâ\\x80\\x99s. She was vexed,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, more frankly than she had yet spoken ; â\\x80\\x98 but she meant to be kind.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then you thanked her ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 O Louis, you pay so much attention to my conduct with Madame ! How do you know there was anything to thank her for ? Well, yes, I did. But I am not going to answer ques-44 ONE YEAR. tions, I tell youâ\\x80\\x94not even looks. I am going to the quai for a little fish for Monsieur, and all you are to do meanwhile is to forget every single thing about this afternoon, and to imagine you have spent it in sleeping.â\\x80\\x99 Louis smiled, a weary, puzzled smile, and her heart smote her as she ran down the stairs. Madame Sanson pounced upon her from the little glazed apartment below. She was in a flutter of indignation, which entirely prevented her hearing anything Ursule might have to urge in defence, and scarcely allowed her 172 self time to speak intelligibly. â\\x80\\x98 Such follyâ\\x80\\x94such ingratitudeâ\\x80\\x94such waste of opportunities ! I would not believe Sanson when he told me. Is it true ? No; I will not believe it. Do you know what it is you are throwing away ?â\\x80\\x94and all that I have gone through.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule had no opportunity of answering, but at this last sen 172 tence she drew herself up indignantly. Madame was not advancing her cause. â\\x80\\x98 I said so much for youâ\\x80\\x94I gave her no peace â\\x80\\x99 (Madame did not say that she had, moreover, promised to advance what 172 ever money was required for the girl, but it was the truth) ; â\\x80\\x98 it is too provoking of you ! I canâ\\x80\\x99t believe you understand to what you are saying no. You have never been away: you donâ\\x80\\x99t figure to yourself the delightsâ\\x80\\x94the movement, the gaiety at the railway station, the trains and the passengers. Should I not like to be always going backwards and forwards ! When I make a journey of the kindâ\\x80\\x94it is not often, but when it does occur, I say to Sanson, â\\x80\\x9c Ah, Jules, mon ami, this is different, this is life one is on good terms with all the world. And you, you will not go ! Such a paradise of a countiy ; such a garden of fruit-trees ; such streets, and shops, and factories at Rouen ! You will not go ? It is inconceivable.â\\x80\\x99ON THE QUAI. 45 Madame was thoroughly put out and annoyed. For a length of time Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny had been in the habit of indulging in vague dreams about a little journey into the country. A relation of hers was married to an avocat at Rouen, and had more than once asked Madame to spend a short time there with her. She was half inclined to go, and half terrified at the prospect of the undertaking; and it was Madame Sanson who had first thought of Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s going as her companion, and then had really given her no rest until she wrote to the avocatâ\\x80\\x99s wife and obtained a ready answer and hospitable extension of the invitation to Ursuleâ\\x80\\x94Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny thinking that she would thus obtain a companion who would take a great deal off her hands upon the journey, and Madame Sanson agreeing privately to pay the girlâ\\x80\\x99s expenses, while, apparently, the pa 172 tronage rested in the hands of her first-floor lodger. And Ursule had absolutely refused ! I am not sure that there can be anything more annoying to kindly-natured people than to have their pet schemes for the good of some one in whom they are interested upset by the obstinacy of the person himself. It is such a gratuitous hin 172 drance. Other obstacles they will meet with their accustomed good humour; but this is unpardonable. Madame repeated in a tone of the utmost irritation, â\\x80\\x98 You will not go ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Dear Madame, I cannot.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule was leaning over the back of a chair, with her face turned away from her old friend ; but something in the tone of her voice struck the latter, and made her go up to her, take her head in both hands, and turn it to the light. A tear twinkled in each eye. â\\x80\\x98 Ah-h-h ! â\\x80\\x99 cried Madame, triumphantly, instantly dropping46 ONE YEAR. into the chair, with all her good humour restored. â\\x80\\x98 Now I begin to see. You would like to go after all ; to be sure, to be sure, that is as it should be. I always run my head against a post when, contrary to my own convictions, I listen to Sanson, who is a good man in his way, but without discernment. And now we will come to the inside of the matter. You wish to go, I wish you to go, Madame wishes you to go; what more can be needed?â\\x80\\x99 Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes flashed indignantly round upon her. â\\x80\\x98 Is Louis not to be thought of? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And what possible harm can come to him ? â\\x80\\x99 answered Madame calmly. â\\x80\\x98Am not I here? And should I not take care to see more to his comfort if you were absent ? Bah, bah ! if that is all, we shall do well enough.â\\x80\\x99 The girl shook her head. â\\x80\\x98 I acknowledge that I should like to see all the fine things you tell me about, for they must be beautiful,â\\x80\\x99 she said, simply ; â\\x80\\x98 but it is of no use. Louis and I have never been separated ; I cannot leave him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Now you will enrage me again,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, casting up her hands; â\\x80\\x98and if Sanson returns from his promenade and finds me out of temper, nobody knows what may happen. Answer me one question, What does the poor boy himself say to all this fuss ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 He? He does not know. â\\x80\\x98You have told him nothing?â\\x80\\x99 said the old woman in shrill astonishment. â\\x80\\x98 But no, certainly ! Why, you know Louis by this time; you know he would fret himself into a fever if he thought he was the cause of my not going. I would not have him learn it for all the world.â\\x80\\x99ON THE QUAI. 47 â\\x80\\x98 But how could you help it ?â\\x80\\x94was it not very hard to keep counsel ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Not so very,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, laughing; â\\x80\\x98the tongue need not say all that the heart contains.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It says a great deal more sometimes, as to that, Mademoiselle. But you may rest assured that I shall tell him at the first oppor 172 tunity, and see what he says to these ridiculous ideas.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule put her hands upon her old friendâ\\x80\\x99s shoulders. â\\x80\\x98You will do nothing of the kind,â\\x80\\x99 she said, looking steadily at her with eyes from which every trace of sadness had vanished. â\\x80\\x98Until to-day I never knew you could be cross and unkind. I say solemnly that, if you tell Louis one word of the matter, I will never speak to you againâ\\x80\\x94never, never, never ! Think of that ! What would become of you, I should like to know, if you had not me to tease you ? I will not hear another word ; but instead of my going aivay, you and Monsieur shall come to a little feast with us to-morrow, if Louis is well. You will; will you not? And you will show me the way to mix Monsieurâ\\x80\\x99s favourite salad. Do not fear ; Louisâ\\x80\\x99 cleverness is making us quite rich, and, remember, you have promised ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What have I promised ? â\\x80\\x99 soliloquised Madame, arranging a sort of loose, flapping concern which decorated her head, and had been seriously disarranged by Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s parting hug. â\\x80\\x98 Do what one will, that is a terrible child for always having her own way.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule sped along as if her errand engrossed all her thoughts, nodding gaily to such of the shopkeepers as, tempted by the bright beauty of the afternoon and that instinctive love of open- air enjoyment which belongs to the French people, were lounging or sitting at the doors of their shops ; but not lingering to ex 172 change greetings with any of them. They had known her since48 ONE YEAR. childhood, and were indulgent of the free, independent ways which they would not have permitted in their own daughters ; though, to do her justice, however impatient of restraint she might be, not a word of blame as to unmaidenly conduct in speech or action had ever been imputed to her. She went to the halle, bought the fish destined for Monsieur Sansonâ\\x80\\x99s consumption, and emerged on the side of the building facing the quay. Once having executed her commission, her hurry seemed to evaporate, and she loitered near the brink of the harbour, watching a ponderously built lugger being hauled in to discharge her contents. Clumsy and ugly as the vessel looked, even under the last rays of a gloriously setting sun, which not only made the grey clouds radiant, but touched the most ordinary objects with grand effects of light and shadow, there was a shade of romance in the name carefully painted on the sternâ\\x80\\x94the â\\x80\\x98Jeune Marguerite,â\\x80\\x99 that took Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s fancy. Wondering who was the â\\x80\\x98Jeune Marguerite,â\\x80\\x99 how long the pretty name had clung to the battered old vessel, whether the neatness with which it had evidently been but lately re 172 painted spoke of hope fulfilled, or hope deferred, or sad remembrance, her thoughts went back by their usual inevitable sequence to Louis. Inheriting something of her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s artistic genius, she gathered in a moment all the principal points of the busy scene before her for his benefit : the long, sharp shadows on the dusty roadâ\\x80\\x94the quaint red-tiled roofs flaming under the sunbeamsâ\\x80\\x94piles of cordageâ\\x80\\x94bales of goodsâ\\x80\\x94moun 172 tains of basketsâ\\x80\\x94groups of gesticulating sailors, in caps of vivid scarletâ\\x80\\x94green water lapping ceaselessly under the dis 172 coloured wallâ\\x80\\x94boats fidgeting round the larger vesselsâ\\x80\\x94the â\\x80\\x98 Jeune Marguerite â\\x80\\x99 lumbering wearily alongside. Three women standing near her, with snowy caps and bright brass milk-cans,ON THE QUAI. 49 were comparing notes upon their fortune at the market ; a little child, belonging to one of the number, feasted upon a great handful of cherries. Ursule began to sing softly to herself; the elder women were too much engaged to hear it ; but the child stopped eating, listened, and finally threw her a cherry for a reward. She would not come nearer, however, though Ursule smiled and beckoned ; but, as soon as the song ceased, returned to her occupation of cherry-eating. Ursule added the trim little creature, with her round cheeks and eager eyes, to her picture for Louis, thinking that, if she could make him see the easy, childish attitude and the dangling fruit, he might con 172 trive to sketch a likeness. Then the thought forced itself upon her against which she had been fighting all theafternoonâ\\x80\\x94how much that was newand beau 172 tiful she might bring back to interest him if she went away for that weekâ\\x80\\x99s holiday. She was fierce with herself for the very fact of having to battle with the longing at all ; frightened at the force with which it returned upon her. In these days, when compara 172 tively the quietest lives have in them a degree of movement unknown in old times, it is difficult to conceive an existence so uneventful as hers had been. It seemed to her that to make this projected expedition would be to enter upon a world of delight. Imagination painted it in the most glowing colours ; to no one on the earth could Rouen prove so charming as she pictured it. Until now she had not been able to think the mat 172 ter quietly over by herself. When she had descended into the salon, it was to be received by Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny sitting in dignity in the borrowed great oak chair, with her hands folded before her, and so full of the importance of the communication she was about to make, that Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s small stock of patience had difficulty in meeting the demands made upon it. It was 45Â° ONE YEAR. long before she could gather more than that a great favour was about to be bestowed upon her, and this she was suspicious would resolve itself into one of Madameâ\\x80\\x99s peculiarly one-sided favours. But as, little by little, the project was disclosed, she was lost in a perfect maze of overpowering delight. It seemed as if a bit of the curtain which shut out a beautiful unknown world were to be lifted. She was very young, very inexperienced, and novelty meant enjoyment. Two or three moments of this dream of happiness, and she remembered Louis. How could she have forgotten ? What had she been thinking of? Down went the curtain again ; a chill crept over everything; her face, which had been so radiant and joyous, grew blank. Madame marvelled why, in the midst of broken words of thanks, she suddenly stopped and shook her head ; but when she gathered that she was absolutely declining the proposal, her indignation knew no bounds. It was no wonder that the shrill, angry rav 172 ings penetrated to Louis overhead. Instead of touching Ursule, it made her bitter, feeling, as she did, as if the offer had been only a mockery; angry, too, with herself for having for an instant allowed herself to dream of leaving Louis, and still more for feeling that she actually wanted to go, and that the giving it up was a sharp disappointment. It was tender, unself 172 ish love which made her realize what it would cost him to let her go, and heroically turn away from her bright visions ; but poor Ursule was very far from possessing the self-control that was needed to bear patiently with Madameâ\\x80\\x99s words. Reverence for age, which would have helped many young girls, seemed entirely wanting or undeveloped in her, and the scolding went on so vehemently on either side that it was a wonder their quarrels vere ever made up. This last had ended in a sort of truce.ON THE QUAI. Madame exhausted her words, and Ursule felt she had been ungrateful. Then came her talk with Louis, her lecture from Madame Sanson, and her meditations upon the quay. At last she shook herself out of a kind of dream, and turned homewards. The women and the little child, the milk-pails and cherries, had departed; the sunlight was fast fading; one bright gleam still lingered lovingly upon the stern of the old vessel, and lit up the fresh white letters, â\\x80\\x98La Jeune Marguerite.â\\x80\\x99 All the way home the words danced before Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes.CHAPTER IV. A QUARREL AND ITS RESULT. Fal.â\\x80\\x94This chair shall be my state. King Henry IV. upon her pulling about the scanty furniture, changing the posi 172 tion of the pictures, and bringing in fresh green branches with which to decorate the stove, and certainly by his criticisms rather hindered her than otherwise; she taking it all with perfect good humour, and something of tender motherly love that was touching when the relations between them were considered. â\\x80\\x98So?â\\x80\\x99 said she, standing aside that he might judge whether the table with its snowy covering was placed exactly in the right angle. â\\x80\\x98 A little more this way. The red house is prettier than the other, for a view.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Monsieur will not greatly regard the view,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, laughing. â\\x80\\x98 O Louis, nothing but that idea of mine about the salad would have dragged him up all those stairs. Since you saw him, he has grown more of a porpoise than ever.â\\x80\\x99A QUARREL AND ITS RESULT. â\\x80\\x98 Where can he sit ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That is perplexing me,â\\x80\\x99 she answered, glancing ruefully round. â\\x80\\x98 He will break down the chairs.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98It is certain; and,moreover, one is broken already.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ursule, we have forgotten !â\\x80\\x94the oak chair ! â\\x80\\x99 The girl clapped her hands. â\\x80\\x98Where are my wits? It is that, of courseâ\\x80\\x94the very thing, and it had quite gone out of my head. I should have brought it up the-day after the fÃªte, only Madame looked so proud and happy in it that I had not the heart to remove it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She could have it again,â\\x80\\x99 called out Louis, always anxious to prevent disagreement. But his sister did not hear him; she was already half-way down the stairs, bent upon the recovery of the borrowed property. As ill-luck would have it, Madame was sitting in the very chair when its owner entered the room, and neither face nor attitude looked propitious. Her indignation with Ursule had increased rather than subsided; for although she might originally have been of many minds about going to Rouen, since an obstacle had been placed in her way, she was persuaded it was the one pleasure without which she could not exist, and Ursule, as the means of disappointment, incurred her severest displeasure, without a thought of sympathy for what the refusal had evidently cost the girl. Her favourite mode of retaliation was to take no notice of her entrance, and she sat rigid and immovable, while Ursule, who always forgot the storms as soon as they were over, preferred her request as inoffensively as she could. â\\x80\\x98 I am desolated to disarrange Madame, but weâ\\x80\\x94my brother and Iâ\\x80\\x94have friends with us to-day.â\\x80\\x99 She was proceeding to54 ONE YEAR. mention who the friends were, but prudently forbore, remem 172 bering that the Sanson name was apt to cause offence. She waited for some notice to be taken of the little announcement, which to her sounded very imposing; but finding no answer was vouchsafed, she went gaily on : â\\x80\\x98 And the truth is, that we have not chairs enough, so that I am forced to ask Madame to let me take away this,â\\x80\\x99 laying her hand upon its carved back as she spoke. â\\x80\\x98 What ! â\\x80\\x99 cried the old lady, sharply. â\\x80\\x98 The chair, Madameâ\\x80\\x94our chair.â\\x80\\x99 Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny rose up in a fever of indignation. â\\x80\\x98 Dites, donc, have you come here to insult me? Not content with your infamous behaviour yesterday, your ingratitude towards meâ\\x80\\x94 me, who have been your best friendâ\\x80\\x94not content with that, do you desire to drag away the very chair I sit upon ? â\\x80\\x99 Â£ But it was only lent ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Ursule, confounded. â\\x80\\x98 Do you then require the eyes to see that such an article as this belongs of right to the salon ? If it has been all this time up-stairs with you, it proves only that the people of this house have no idea of the fitness of things. Do not suppose that I shall allow it to be removed.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Madame ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Understand me, I shall not, I say ! â\\x80\\x99 cried Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, losing her dignity in rage, and raising her tones in a shrill crescendo. * It is the chair in which Louis sits : you do not know what you sayâ\\x80\\x94you must be mad,â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, scornfully. â\\x80\\x98 Mad ! Hear herâ\\x80\\x94the insolent ! And this is Madame Sansonâ\\x80\\x99s pattern demoiselle, the excellent sister, the admirable companion ! Yes, yes, yes, this is she ! But here you shall not remain; leave the apartment, do you hear?â\\x80\\x99A QUARREL AND ITS RESULT. 55 â\\x80\\x98 Not without the chair. You are a bad, wicked woman to want to keep it from Louis,â\\x80\\x99 cried Ursule, in a passion. â\\x80\\x98 I repeat, it is not for people such as you : you may take one of the others in its stead. There ! â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, calming down a little. â\\x80\\x98 I will not. Bah ! the chair is for us, and you shall not steal it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Never approach me again ! â\\x80\\x99 said Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny. â\\x80\\x98 Rest assured, I will not.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Go!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98The chair, Madame.â\\x80\\x99 In the midst of a torrent of words, which burst forth in answer, Ursule pulled the object of dispute towards the door. Madame would fain have sat upon it, and so impeded its removal; but the girl was young, strong, and angry, and she feared an ignominious discomfiture. She could only repeat in a voice half choked with rage, â\\x80\\x98 You shall never again be admitted ; I endure this for the last time.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98If Madameâ\\x80\\x99s is comme-il-faut behaviour,â\\x80\\x99 retorted Ursule, with crimson face, â\\x80\\x98 she has at least taught me what to avoid.â\\x80\\x99 Madame slammed the door. Ursule dragged the great chair with difficulty up the stairs, her first glow of triumph fading into a sore, hurt sensation of shame. Never, in all her experi 172 ence of quarrels, had there been a scene like this. She left the chair upon the highest landing, and ran in to Louis; and it was proof of the disturbance of her feelings that, instead of being careful to spare him from any share in the worry, she felt the longing to pour everything into his ear irresistible. â\\x80\\x98 I have brought it,â\\x80\\x99 she said, in a hurried voice ; â\\x80\\x98 but I am never going near her again.â\\x80\\x995 6 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98Ursule!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is true, it is quite true,â\\x80\\x99 she went on passionately ; â\\x80\\x98 she is a wicked woman ; and it humiliates me to lose myself, and say the things I cannot help saying.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You can help calling her so wrong a name,â\\x80\\x99 said the boy, gravely, but still continuing to smooth the brown head laid upon his pillow, as if by that tender action he could quiet the angry whirl within. â\\x80\\x98 No one could bear it,â\\x80\\x99 she said, excusing herself a little. â\\x80\\x98 It is so hard, is it ? But still â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah, Louis, you cannot judge;â\\x80\\x99 then, fearing she had hurt him, she continued quickly, â\\x80\\x98 It is we women, you know, who quarrel with one another.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes, indeed, since the Olympian days ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I know you want me to think about itâ\\x80\\x99s being wrong, but I am not good like youâ\\x80\\x94I never shall be, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t feel the wrongness. It seems to me that, when one meets injustice, one ought to be angryâ\\x80\\x94to resist. I hate it: it makes my heart burn, and then I say so ;â\\x80\\x94why not ? It is not for that I am sorry, but for the scolding that I do, just like Madame herself. It makes me despise myself, it is so little ! â\\x80\\x99 Louis was painfully sensitive about giving advice. His pale face flushed. â\\x80\\x98 You donâ\\x80\\x99t keep the reins over yourself, is that it ? I fancy you and Madame must be something alike ; but that is nothing, because you know she has a right to expect forbear 172 ance.â\\x80\\x99 He hesitated, then drew out the little French Bible, which was always under his pillow, and, turning the pages rapidly, made Ursule look at the lines to which he pointed. She looked and shook her head. â\\x80\\x98 I suppose there are many good people who really feel like that : I cannot.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You can do many disagreeable things for my sake, Ursule.â\\x80\\x99A QUARREL AND ITS RESULT. 57 â\\x80\\x98 Anything ! â\\x80\\x99 she answered quickly, turning upon him a face full of love. â\\x80\\x98But this would be all for myself. No? What do you mean? Ah, I see : yes, if one could realize that object, I can understand how it would make the hard things possible ; but I do not realize it, cr only a littleâ\\x80\\x94not as you do. I wish I could really be good. I wish it often, and it never, never comes.â\\x80\\x99 An English girl would have more readily taken it for granted that the goodness would â\\x80\\x98 come â\\x80\\x99 some day, and the words sounded light; but there was a ring of earnestness and humility about them from which a more experienced and a less anxious observer than Louis would have drawn comfort. It was after speeches of this kind, however, that the boy, older in every 172 thing but years than his sister, longed most earnestly for some person to help and advise them, and was most conscious of his own incapacity. All Madame Sansonâ\\x80\\x99s troubles and conscience- pricks were carried to confession, and she felt, on her return, to use her own expression, as light as an egg-shell. She had a simple confiding faith, never disturbed by side-winds of doubt, seldom with questions of what she ought or ought not to do : if such a question embarrassed her, she packed it carefully on one side, in a sort of mental receptacle which corresponded with the pocket of her dress, until the appointed Saturday evening, when she found her way to the dimly lighted church, and yielded up a somewhat heterogeneous collection, to be disposed of im 172 plicitly as Monsieur le CurÃ© directed. Without such a resource she was helpless, and would only have been far more bewildered than Ursule if the wild questioning thoughts and longings that flitted through the girlâ\\x80\\x99s brain had been revealed to her. Her husband, on his part, like the majority of his class, was merely tolerant, not approving of the power of the priests, recognizingONE YEAR. it as something to be feared, and, for that very reason, secretly delighted when by some meansâ\\x80\\x94not of his own creatingâ\\x80\\x94it received a check, but equally unwilling to take a prominent part in opposition. Certainly, no help was to be derived from Monsieur or Madame Sanson; Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny was yet more completely out of the question ; and Louis replaced his little Bible beneath his pillow with a sigh which cut Ursule to the heart. Up she sprang with one of her bewildering changes of mood. 1 0 Louis, why do you let me stay chattering, when I have more things to do than my head will hold ? and in ten minutes they will be here ! â\\x80\\x99 She darted hither and thither, working in earnest, putting finishing-touches to her arrangements with a light and gradeful hand, and contriving to infuse a festive air over the homely, un 172 pretending little room. A long interval elapsed between the creak announcing that Monsieurâ\\x80\\x99s foot was planted on the first step, and the great sigh which told that the ascent was com 172 pleted ; and when he came puffing into the room, his wife, on tiptoe behind him, nodding with good-humoured delight at the brother and sister, he sank speechless into the great chair witli a weight that shook the house. â\\x80\\x98 Here we are, children,â\\x80\\x99 cried Madame, bestowing a pat on the head upon her husband, by way of assisting the recovery of his breath ; â\\x80\\x98 but truly it will not be well for the stability of the house if Sanson often makes these excursions. Courage, mon ami, you will be better presently.â\\x80\\x99 Monsieur, an enormous man with iron-grey stubbly hair, and dressed in a loose brown alpaca coat, feebly shook his head, implying that he was not yet in a condition to exert himself, and Madame rattled on cheerily.A QUARREL AND ITS RESULT. â\\x80\\x98 How nice she has made everything look, the little one ! Ah ! she can be clever when she will. I will sit here close to Louis, and you there. Julesâ\\x80\\x99s breath is coming, so we can begin.â\\x80\\x99 Madame had too much delicacy to have offered any assist 172 ance for this little banquet ; and, as Ursule distrusted her own capacity for pleasing Monsieur too greatly to trust entirely to her own powers, she had ventured upon the extravagance of having one modest dish from the restaurateur, and was rewarded by the marked satisfaction which she saw gradually diffused over his face as soon as breath came to the aid of his senses. â\\x80\\x98 How is it with you, Louis ?â\\x80\\x99 pursued Madame ; â\\x80\\x98has Ursule brought you home all the news lately ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Not much news,â\\x80\\x99 he said, smiling; â\\x80\\x98but I know about the sunset last evening, and the little girl, and the â\\x80\\x9cJeune Mar 172 guerite,â\\x80\\x9d do I not, Ursule?â\\x80\\x99 Madame stared. â\\x80\\x98 What foolish things, to be sure ! Have you not told him all the talk about Mademoiselle de Chaulieu and her marriage with M. Valette? Nor what you heard Susanne relating to me of her master, the sous-lieutenantâ\\x80\\x99s difficulties with his family? No? well, you young people are inexplicable ! Have you seen our Madame to-day ?â\\x80\\x99 The girl coloured crimson. â\\x80\\x98 Do not talk of her ! She ex 172 pects me to endure too much; but it is at an endâ\\x80\\x94I do not go to her again.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Not go to her again ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Not?â\\x80\\x99 grunted Monsieur, affectionately contemplating the morsel upon his fork. â\\x80\\x98 It is true.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But what ! why ! I do not comprehend : she cannot do without you.â\\x80\\x996o ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98I cannot help it/ said Ursule, pettishly; â\\x80\\x98it is her own desire.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then it must be because you refused â\\x96\\xa0â\\x80\\x99 and Madame, feeling herself a miracle of prudence, stopped, nodded, and then shook her head. But she had gone too far. M. Sanson, feeling in himself an utter incapability of originating an idea, was in the habit of completing sentences for other people, and perceiving an opportunity for a speech longer than usual, he took advantage of his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s pause. â\\x80\\x98Because you refused to go to Rouen with the old lady,â\\x80\\x99 said he, triumphantly. â\\x80\\x98 Be quiet, Sanson ! â\\x80\\x99 interrupted his wife; but it was too late. Ursule bit her lip, Madame fidgeted, Monsieur opened his eyes ; Louis alone took no apparent notice. â\\x80\\x98 He talks without knowing what he says,â\\x80\\x99 continued Madame, apologetically. â\\x80\\x98Eh?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98There, there; that will do. Eat your dinner, like a good man.â\\x80\\x99 M. Sanson laughed good-humouredly. â\\x80\\x98 Ah, she crooked her finger when the ring was put on,â\\x80\\x99 he said, indicating his wife by a sign. â\\x80\\x98 What was that for ? â\\x80\\x99 inquired Louis. â\\x80\\x98 What ! donâ\\x80\\x99t you know ? When a young girl gets married, if the ring slides straight down the finger, she is her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s slave all her life, poor thing ; but if it stops at the second joint, he will never be able to get the upper hand. I thought of it for a week before, and much good that did me; for, when the time came, something took off my attention, and before I knew anything about it the ring was on ! Ah, if I can only get a second chance ! â\\x80\\x99 There was something so ludicrous in Madameâ\\x80\\x99s threat, andA QUARREL AND ITS RESULT. 6r i in the notion of her being in any sense a slave to her obedient husband, that Ursule could not help laughing merrily; and, after all, it was just possible Louis had not noticed that un 172 lucky slip of Monsieurâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94or he might forget itâ\\x80\\x94or, at least, she would not think about it now. She made an efficient hostess, and the repast had evidently been brought to a suc 172 cessful termination, when Monsieur, with a sigh of satisfaction, washed down the whole of a NeufchÃ¢tel cheese with a tumbler of light wine; Louis, who could scarcely realize an ordinary manâ\\x80\\x99s appetite, looking on with wondering amusement. â\\x80\\x98What has become of M. Pierre?â\\x80\\x99 asked Madame. â\\x80\\x98 I have not seen him for an age.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Nor I,â\\x80\\x99 said Louis, eagerly. â\\x80\\x98 What can be keeping himaway?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Perhaps what Auguste Drouet told me has truth in it after all, though he talks so much that I do not pay attention to half; but he assured me that M. Renait desires his son to marry Mademoiselle Roget, daughter of the Maire of Bâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94, with I do not know how many thousand francs dowry, and that the young man is averse.â\\x80\\x99 She glanced at Ursule as she spoke. Madame could not live at the bottom of the stairs, and remain ignorant of Pierreâ\\x80\\x99s feelings towards the girl; but her own sentiments on the subject were conflicting. She was proud of her favouriteâ\\x80\\x99s conquest, yet appalled at the utter hopelessness of such a marriage being ever permitted, and unable to solve her doubts as to her own conduct in the matter, by carrying them to confession, because she knew that afterwards the marriage of the rich clay-moulderâ\\x80\\x99s son with the young heretic could not innocently be allowed even to enter into her dreams. She would not altogether give up the idea, and yet dared not harbour it. She crossed her little fat hands on her lap, and looked curiously at Ursule as02 ONE YEAR. she announced his betrothal; but the girl only shrugged her shoulders and slightly lifted her eyebrows, and she could not make out whether her indifference was real or feigned. She chatted away for some time longer, until a summons came from below, and arousing Jules with difficulty from an after-dinner nap, she conveyed him safely down the stairs. â\\x80\\x98 It has been nice; but I wish you would not look so terribly tired, Louis,â\\x80\\x99 said his sister, kneeling in her favourite attitude by his side. â\\x80\\x98 So that was your secret ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 O Louis, I hoped you had not heard ! That dear, stupid old Monsieur ! But never mind now. After to-day, I would not go; no, not for all the holidays in the world. And what do I want of holidays ? It just seemed tempting, you know, at first; but the feeling soon went away. I should be miserable without you. And with Madame! No, indeed.â\\x80\\x99 Louis sighed. â\\x80\\x98 I suppose it cannot be now ; but I should dearly have liked you to go, my Ursule.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I will tell you how it shall be : by-and-by, when you have earned a fortune, and grown strong, we will go togetherâ\\x80\\x94you and I.â\\x80\\x99 Grown strong! It seemed a mockery to talk of him and strength in one breath, and perhaps Louis felt it so, when he turned his face into the pillow and did not answer. He said nothing; nothing even when Ursule talked on, in a low, dreaming voice, of the lovely apple-orchards in their rosy blush of blossom, and the glossy chestnut trees, and the old grey chateaux by river banks, which they would see and linger by in that wonderful future time when he was strong. But his grasp tightened on the little brown Bible, and perhaps there came to him visions of a more abiding Beauty. The day passed, and another after it ; Ursule did not go nearA Q UARREL AND ITS RESULT. 6 3 Madame, and Pierre Renait did not come. Louis was m despair about his friend ; he had scarcely known how much he counted upon his visits, and what a break they made in the dajâ\\x80\\x99s unvaried monotony, until now that they were wanting. He worried himself into one of his worst headaches when he found that the following morning came and went without Pierre; and Ursule acted the tyrant, and summarily deprived him of his painting, when she saw his hands so weak and trembling that he could hardly hold the brush. By this time she had relented towards Madame. Her anger was never long-lived, and when she pictured to herself the desolation and dreariness down-stairs, her heart smote her. â\\x80\\x98 After all, she does not mean what she says, any more than I do,â\\x80\\x99 she said to Louis. â\\x80\\x98 I will run down as usual; I heard her come in not five minutes ago.â\\x80\\x99 But her mission was unsuccessful. Madameâ\\x80\\x99s door was per 172 sistently locked, and though she asked for admittance more than once, not even a reply was vouchsafed. Tears gathered in her eyes as she slowly went up the stairs again. Were they losing all their friends ? Had her tongue offended Pierre as surely as Madame? Never was she so gay as that afternoon in her en 172 deavours to prevent Louis from missing his friend; she chatted, laughed, sang, and brought her pigeons in to show him. The next day, when she knew again that Madame was at home, she went down, but with the same result; the door was fastened inexorably, and half irritated, half grieved, she went to Madame Sanson to know whether she could afford her an explanation. Her old friend listened with a perplexed face. â\\x80\\x98 She is obsti 172 nate, and she is very angry; I do not think anything will satisfy her but your going to Rouen.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And that I cannot do,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule sadly, â\\x80\\x98so there must be64 ONE YEAR. an end of the matter. You do not know how much Louis frets in his heart over Pierre not coming. The stupid fellow; he shall hear what I think of it when I see him.â\\x80\\x99 * Perhaps the poor lad is ill.â\\x80\\x99 And this suggestion, although it did not suffice for Ursule, who was a veritable autocrat on all points that touched Louisâ\\x80\\x99 comfort, served to carry up-stairs as a possible explanation of his conduct. The next day Pierre was still absent, and Ursule made no attempt at reconciliation with Madame. Perhaps she would have abstained yet longer, had not Louis looked so ill and wretched, and entreated her so earnestly once more to make the trial, that pride gave way to anxiety for him, and she knocked again at Madameâ\\x80\\x99s door, but only to find it as closely as ever barred against her. â\\x80\\x98 This is horrible ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, running down to Madame Sanson ; â\\x80\\x98 how can Madame be so unforgiving ? and how can she manage without me ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I have to do itâ\\x80\\x94that is all. Well, child, never mind, there is no need for it; only one canâ\\x80\\x99t let her live as she would if it was left to herself. It makes my old bones ache; but what then? they are not the worse.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I will make her let me in,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, stamping her foot, and much shocked at the extra labour which she know her desertion must have entailed upon the good old woman. â\\x80\\x98She will not, unless you are prepared with concessions. Why not go with her, child? You will be doing a kindness, as well as making the peace ; and you know in your heart that Louis would like you to go, and that he shall be as well cared for as if he were my own.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98It is not possible. Even if I had thought of it before, I could not now, when he has not even Pierre.â\\x80\\x99A QUARREL AND ITS RESULT. 65 â\\x80\\x98 Ah, well, if that is all,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame mysteriously, Â£ perhaps if you went Monsieur Pierre would come.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If I went !â\\x80\\x94what riddles do you talk ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It used to be all very well ; but you are older now, and Pierre is a modest young man ; he knows that it is not alto 172 gether convenable for him to make so many visits, and that the world will talk. That is not good for a girl.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Did Pierre himself tell you this ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Ursule, with curling lip. â\\x80\\x98 Something of the sort.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98When?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 This very morning.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I would not have believedâ\\x80\\x94the folly, the childishness ! â\\x80\\x99 Her voice, angry and impetuous as it was, quivered. She began to think that all the world was against her, and she turned away from Madame and drummed with her fingers upon the window- panes. Madameâ\\x80\\x99s account, though right in its conclusions, was not altogether correct as to facts. Pierre, it is true, had been there that morning, but it was in a fluster of indignation, and a pro 172 fessed determination to make his way up-stairs in spite of his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s injunctions. His presence on the balcony on the day of the fÃªte had been commented upon and reported to his father, who, upon questioning his wife and daughters, learned something of the true state of the case, and determined at once to put matters upon a safe footing by giving a reality to what had long been talked of in the family, and asking the hand of rich Mademoiselle Roget for his son. Pierre had not dared so much as to expostulate when his father quietly added a desire that his visits at the Lafonsâ\\x80\\x99 should be discontinued ; but he made up for his silence by storming furiously in private, and66 ONE YEAR. his conversation with Madame Sanson was enlivened by a variety of distracted ejaculations and gestures which were abso 172 lutely tragic in their vehemence. After what he confided to her, she had the good sense to refuse to allow him to go up 172 stairs; and perhaps her decision relieved him, although he thought it necessary to press for permission, and to declare himself ready to defy all the enemies of his happiness and cling to Ursule. He really felt and looked very wretched; but, after all, he did not for a moment entertain the idea of com 172 bating his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s will, and was well aware that his fate in the shape of a contract would soon be signed. Madame had altered this little history in her hint to Ursule, and for two reasonsâ\\x80\\x94first, out of delicacy to the girl, and, secondly, from doubt of what her feelings might be. If she could be induced to go away, there was no occasion, she reasoned, for her little excursion to be spoiled, as it surely would be if she had thought of young Monsieur Pierre in any 172 thing beyond the light of Louisâ\\x80\\x99 friend ; and, on the other hand, this absence, short as it was, might be the means of distracting her thoughts, and changing their current. She dwelt upon all this with real admiration for her diplomatic powers, and was so wrapped up in it that she started and uttered a little scream, when Ursule turned suddenly round and said abruptly, â\\x80\\x98 I have heard it said that when one has wished for something very much, it often comes with all the pleasantness taken out of it. At first I wanted to go to Rouen, and, now that I do not wish it at all, I suppose I shall go.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Good, good ! â\\x80\\x99 said Madame Sanson. â\\x80\\x98 Now all will be well. Not wish to go ? Bah ! that is folly. It will enchant you so that you will never want to come back again.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Who is to tell Madame?â\\x80\\x99 asked Ursule, still crossly.A QUARREL AND ITS RESULT 67 â\\x80\\x98 I will manage all that. And see here, I will sleep in your room all the time you are away, so that Louis shall want for nothing in the night.â\\x80\\x99 The girl flung her arms round her neck. â\\x80\\x98You are a hundred times better to me than I deserve ! Will you really do that ? Then I shall go with a light heart, and I will begin to enjoy it from this moment, if it is only to please you.â\\x80\\x99 Madame had no fears of her lodger. She knew that such a concession on Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s part would at once restore her to good humour; and she was right. Nothing could be more gracious, more affable, than Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny that evening when Ursule went to see her. No allusioh was made to past disagreements or bolted doors ; she was full of talk about the charms of her relation, the avocatâ\\x80\\x99s wife, and the costumes to be arranged for the visit. From every receptacle in the room she had rummaged the faded splendours of past days. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x94who was inwardly chafing at having been, as it were, cajoled into the expedition against her judgment, and, if the truth must be told, a little bit jealous at Louisâ\\x80\\x99 expressions of delightâ\\x80\\x94was seized with horror lest Madame might be going to array herself for the occasion in some of these strange relics. If Madame had not been ab 172 sorbed in her own affairs, the girlâ\\x80\\x99s manner could scarcely have escaped comment : she would not profess any pleasure, scarcely attempted thanks, and gave her opinion listlessly, only rousing herself to speak with energy when it was necessary to withhold Madame from some very preposterous scheme of decoration. The truth was, that her nature was altogether undisciplined, and it was the spoiled-child instinct that made her desire to punish Madame for having entrapped her into giving way to her wishes. Yet, in spite of herself, and a determination not to be agree-68 ONE YEAR. able, she could not help, little by little, feeling drawn into interest. The change, the novelty, the first journey she re 172 memberedâ\\x80\\x94new people, a new place, a new life ; there was too much quicksilver in her composition for her to remain really passive at the prospect. Her very ignorance saved her the shy misgivings which might be expected to trouble a girl in her position. It is true that her dress caused her some qualms, for a more slender wardrobe can scarcely be conceived ; but, with her dreams of a genial and easily satisfied world, the thought did not cause her much anxiety. A bright ribbon made it pretty in Louisâ\\x80\\x99 eyes, and she concluded it would be the same with others. Louis, nevertheless, was not so secure, and Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny herself anticipated the question before Ursule made up her mind to inquire. â\\x80\\x98 What is to be your new robe for the occasion ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Mine, Madame.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But certainly ! It is necessary ; it will not be possible for you to enter the house of a family of distinction like my cousinâ\\x80\\x99s without it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, resolutely, â\\x80\\x98 I had better stay away. A new dress, Madame ! and where is the money to come from. Decidedly, I can only stay away.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Do not be so impetuous ; you take away oneâ\\x80\\x99s breath. There can be no question now of going or staying, since the letter is despatched announcing our arrival on Saturday.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Nevertheless, Madame, I need not go.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Bah, bah ! I only spoke in jest. The dress will do charmingly ! A little re-trimming :â\\x80\\x94not even that ? Well, it is simple,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, making up her mind to the shabby attire with a sigh ; â\\x80\\x98 and on the whole it may be as well that the dress should be remarkable only on me.â\\x80\\x99A QUARREL AND ITS RESULT. 69 â\\x80\\x98 They will not expect much when they know that I sweep your room,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, mischievously. â\\x80\\x98 Hush, child, hush ! Are you mad ? Do you not know that you go as a demoiselle, as my friend? You will ruin me with your imprudence ! I entreat you to be discreet, and not to proclaim everything which goes on here in private. My cousin would be shocked were she to learn to what a position my unfortunate affairs have reduced me ; it is unnecessary that she should do so. If you find yourself drawn dangerously into allusions, pass lightly on, treating it as badinage. I depend upon your discretion.â\\x80\\x99 Luckily for the lately established peace, at this moment Madame Sanson entered the room, and Ursule was enabled to escape and carry her indignation to Louis. But he would hear no complaints. So completely had he conquered the first selfish disinclination to spare herâ\\x80\\x94if, indeed, it could at any time have been called by so harsh a nameâ\\x80\\x94that there was nothing forced in his warm delight, and never could she re 172 member him so buoyant and well as during the day or two that elapsed before Saturday. Her dreams were nothing in comparison with his, and the minutest preparation was to him full of interest. Throughout Friday the rain poured down pitilessly. A kind of tarpaulin covering was drawn across the opening over the stairs; the house was darkened; the rain went on steadily drip, drip, upon the temporary roof. Ursule and Louis sat hand in hand, talking busily. He would not allow her to be in the least sentimental about the parting, either then or when the parting really came ; and very little would have served her for an excuse, even at the last moment, to withdraw her promise.70 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 St. Ouen, remember, Ursule; the transept windows and the west porches.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And the organ staircase at St. Maclou, of which my father made a drawing.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Honestly, my Louis, does it make you happier for me to go?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Honestly, it does. Already I am feasting upon your coming back; and you know that if the blind beggar canâ\\x80\\x99t see the world, it is as well for his dog to look about him ! Do not put any more impossible things within my reach, but come here and tell me how soon you will be able to write.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98The very instant I get there. Hark ! Yes, Madame, I am coming. Louis, the facteur has come for the luggage ; I must go. Oh, this is dreadful ! I will never do it again ; do you hear ? This is the first and last time. Coming, Madame ! Good-bye, my dear one, good-byeâ\\x80\\x94a hundred good-byes !â\\x80\\x99 When Louis relaxed the listening attitude which he preserved while the faintest echo of her step and voice was audible, the bright flush 011 his cheek had completely faded away. He leant back against the pillows, and closed his eyes, her last words in his thoughts: â\\x80\\x98She will never do it again. No, she is right; in our next separation it will be for me to go, for her to be left behind ! â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER Y. THE CLAYTONS. Upon the glass the creeping fly Will shut out mightiest worlds on high, And care, to earthly projects given, Will hide from man his God and heaven. â\\x80\\x98 The Cathedral.â\\x80\\x99 EOPLE show their characters in their rooms; there 172 fore it may not be amiss to give a sketch of the drawing-room at No. 100, New Terrace, London, before we glance at its owners. It was a long room, plainly but prettily\\' furnished ; the fire-place, to which the fancy of the first possessor had added a high, old-fashioned, and curiously carved chimney-piece, stood half-way down the room, and was flanked on either side by low, comfortable-looking book-cases. The room ended in a large bow, curtained and fitted with a chintz-covered window-seat; opposite to the fire-place was a small sofa and a piano. The Persian carpet had evidently seen many years of service, so that the pattern required imagination to come to the aid of the eyes ; but it blended admirably with the well-worn air of the greater number of articles in the room. The china that was placed about, though excellent of its kind, was solid-looking, and not such as might easily be broken ;72 ONE YEAR. two oriental jars stood upon the wooden chimney-piece, over which was suspended an oblong mirror, in an old-fashioned, lightly carved ebony frame ; the paper on the walls was pale tea-green ; pictures were sprinkled aboutâ\\x80\\x94one an especially striking chalk head of a beautiful woman ; and upon the table were two or three little easels supporting photographs and illuminations. It was very unlike a London room ; but the part where the house stood had so lately been country, that green fields and nursery-gardens were still to be seen from the upper windows ; the air was still pure ; and the box of gay scarlet geraniums and mignonette outside, and the graceful, silvery fern which grew within, flourished as luxuriantly as if smoke and fog were miles away. The room was not empty. In a corner, close to one of the book-cases, stood a pair of steps, and upon them was perched a young girl, picture-arranging. â\\x80¢\\' There ! \\' said she, with a sigh of relief, letting her arms drop by her side. â\\x80\\x98Never soliloquise, Joyce; but if you are at any time betrayed into the weakness, above all things do not confine yourself to disjointed adverbs.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Papa ! I had no idea you were in the room. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c When people leave this lower world, and choose to live on stilts,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x99 began Mr. Clayton, mischievously. â\\x80\\x98 Does it not look well ? â\\x80\\x99 said his daughter, descending, and stepping back to examine the result of her labours with a critical eye. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I see ! That is the one of which I am always in doubt whether it is upside down or notâ\\x80\\x94which is water and which sky. At all events, it is a satisfaction to have the problem solved for one.â\\x80\\x99THE CLAYTON\\'S. 73 â\\x80\\x98Never mind,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, good-humouredly, quite undis 172 turbed by her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s bantering tone ; â\\x80\\x98 it fills that gap in the wall capitally, and it is just as well that something should be left to the imagination.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My dear, if I had complained, it would have been on that very score. My imagination has always revelled in that gap.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Papa, papa ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, I submit, as usual. Are you coming with me?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Where?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98To St. Andrewâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I should so much like it ; but then â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, what stands in the way ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I promised the Miss Tinlings to give them a lesson in that church work. After that, the Hewitts want to know about Lydia Baker.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Claytonâ\\x80\\x99s genial face looked grave, and he did not answer. Joyce, quick to notice every expression of her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s, said at once : â\\x80\\x98 Did you wish me to go ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Joyce, I was thinking that your life is becoming too busy. â\\x80\\x98 So it is, papa. Really sometimes it seems to me that from morning to night I never have a moment to myself. It is not only when I first awake and think of what has to be done, that the day seems overfilled ; but the next day, and the day after that, I can see must be just the same. To-day is Tuesday; well, let me see : to-morrow, Thursday, Fridayâ\\x80\\x94yes, Satur 172 day is the first day which has a few hours not yet mapped out.â\\x80\\x99 Joyce paused, and her father was still silent; she fancied he was thinking that her life was too hard-worked, and went on cheerfully : â\\x80\\x98 But after all, papa, though I do sometimes grumble, I do74 ONE YEAR. not know that I am really much worse off than other people. Eyery one lives at railroad speed now-a-days : the weeks are not half long enough for the things that have to be crammed into them. And I am sure, on the whole, that it suits me ; I should be perfectly miserable unless my hands were full.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Nevertheless, Joyce, I am not sure that it is good for you.â\\x80\\x99 * It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t hurt me, papa ; I am quite strong.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Clayton, looking fondly on his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s healthy, handsome face ; â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you will easily be overdone with hard work, in health ; and we will put that on one side, or leave the question to your mother. But there are other ways of your life harming you.â\\x80\\x99 Joyce drew back, a little hurt. â\\x80\\x98 Papa, do you mean that I do anything of which you dis 172 approve ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I mean that the choking thorns are not only the riches or the pleasures of the world.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98But the cares also? Yes, of course; but then, what is one to do?â\\x80\\x94everything does seem to come at once. Besides, papa, the things themselves â\\x80\\x99 Joyce hesitated. â\\x80\\x98 Are useful, you mean ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes; at least, I mean they are not pleasant; it is not that I like them. Surely that must be different ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Self-indulgence would never be your form of self-pleasing, Joyce.â\\x80\\x99 She twisted a slip of paper she was holding into a spill. â\\x80\\x98 What is one to do ? â\\x80\\x99 she said, a little impatiently. â\\x80\\x98 Papa, you really donâ\\x80\\x99t know how the small things accumulate ! â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton took no notice of the tone, but he answered quietly, â\\x80\\x98 The only safeguard for any of us is to cultivate the spirit of watchfulness. We are taught to set bounds to ourTHE CLAYTONS. 75 pleasures ; but it is by no means impossible for so-called duties to run away with usâ\\x80\\x94eh, Joyce ? My dear, I know how much you get through, and, as far as I am concerned, I only blame myself for using your help so largely as I do â\\x80\\x98 Papa, donâ\\x80\\x99t say that; I like it,â\\x80\\x99 interrupted Joyce. â\\x80\\x98 But,â\\x80\\x99 continued her father, â\\x80\\x98 there is the universal rule, that we must take in, in order rightly to give out. Put the question honestly to yourself, does a quiet time ever come ? Is not a fresh scheme or excitement always presenting itself?â\\x80\\x99 Joyce was silent. â\\x80\\x98Thank you for telling me,â\\x80\\x99 she said at length, with something of an effort. â\\x80\\x98I will think over it; only really I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe you know how impossible it is to keep out of a network. Now, there is this affair of Lydia Bakerâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I thought Miss Foster had undertaken Lydia Baker.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 So she has, but she makes such mistakes ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Poor Miss Foster ! â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Clayton, resuming his usual cheery manner ; â\\x80\\x98 one mistake is heavily visited upon her ! By the way, Joyce, I had forgotten what I came in to tell you. Clement will be here to-night.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 To-night ! Why he is a perfect Will-oâ\\x80\\x99-the-Wisp ! And really, he might give us a little longer notice. I will go and see about his room at once. Does mamma know ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Your mother has a headache, and is lying down : donâ\\x80\\x99t let her be disturbed. If Maynard comes about the harmonium, you must speak to him, and tell him that his first experiments upon the musical future of the district had better for the present be confined to the Gilpins and Walter Brett. I suppose that the steps may as well depart with me ? â\\x80\\x99 He shouldered them as he spoke, and went out of the room, Joyce following him into the landing, and then going thought 172 fully up-stairs.76 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98Visitors by the dozen on such a day as this, and then Mr. Maynard to expatiate for an hour upon those wearisome harmonium stops. If papa is right, what is to become of one ! I know that I have been obliged to take bits out of my reading 172 time ; but still they are all necessary things that I do, and it is veiy, very hard to avoid them. People are for ever letting their stitches drop, and expecting others to pick them up again, like old Granny Wilcox and her grandchild. Half the things come because I am a clergymanâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, and really it is impossible for papa to understand. I am sure I should be thankful to have more leisure.â\\x80\\x99 Which, as far as it went, was quite true, to do Joyce Clayton justice. Activity and energy were at once thrown into any 172 thing which came before her in the light of a duty, but none the less would she often gladly have launched them into pleasanter paths. Mr. Clayton was perpetual curate of a district church in a London suburb, and Joyce was an only child. Ever since the time when she was a little toddling baby, just able to stand by his chair and hold up a rosy mouth for kissing, she had been her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s pet and constant companion ; so that, from her alphabet onwards, he had taught her all she knew, except the music which was her motherâ\\x80\\x99s special branch. Consequently, the love which existed between them was as deep and full as such a love could be. Joyce inherited her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s talent, as well as a certain capability which accompanied it, and added tenfold to its usefulness ; but the peculiar sunny brightness of his disposition was not so entirely shared by her. It was a rare charming quality. Clouds might threaten, annoyances gather, a hundred parochial worries surround him, and still his buoyant spirit and a never-failing spring of fun seemed toTHE CLAYTONS. 77 shake them off without an effort. There was something so genial, so generous, so young, in his nature, that it attracted people, whether they would or not ; and to have Mr. Clayton at a vestry meeting was certain victory over the most pig 172 headed of churchwardens. As Joyce reached the head of the stairs, her mother called her into her bed-room. She sat in a low chair by the window, workingâ\\x80\\x94a fair, pretty, placid woman, altogether unlike her dark winsome-looking little daughter. â\\x80\\x98 Where is your father, Joyce ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 He has just this moment gone out, mamma.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How tiresome ! I quite forgot to tell him that the glass must be taken out of the store-room.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98He thought you were resting; so that he would not disturb you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Dear me, it is very vexing, with Clement coming this evening.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What brings up Clement at this time of the year, when he never can be induced to recognise London at all ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 There is his letterâ\\x80\\x94you can read it ; I am sure I hardly understand it myself, Clementâ\\x80\\x99s handwriting is so puzzling ; but there is something about his going to France.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98To see his aunt !â\\x80\\x99 Joyce exclaimed, reading in astonishment. â\\x80\\x98 I hope she wonâ\\x80\\x99t turn out such another woman as Mrs. Blunt herself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It will not matter to you, Joyce.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Not at all. It is only for Clementâ\\x80\\x99s sake.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Clement should be more considerate, and not come at such unexpected times. I thought his carpet was to be turned, or something ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Papa gave orders about it last week, luckily. I dare say7 8 ONE YEAR. this is some sudden freak of Mrs. Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s, and that he is obliged to set off at once ; otherwise he might certainly have bestowed a longer warning upon us. Never mind, it is not really of any consequence.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 That is all very well, my dear, but you are no judge ; you have not to look after the cook, and she quite alarms me by her manner : I wish your father would speak to her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Stupid thing!â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, indignantly, â\\x80\\x98you are a great deal too good-natured to her, mamma. Why donâ\\x80\\x99t you give her a good set down, and make her understand?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Your father must do it; I cannot undertake it. How dread 172 fully hot it is! What are you going to do this afternoon? I wish you would come with me to the nursery-gardens.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I canâ\\x80\\x99t possibly, mamma. Mr. Maynard is coming about the harmonium, and the Tinlings about those church markers, and the Hewitts about Lydia Baker.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Clayton, submissively, for she never inter 172 fered with her daughterâ\\x80\\x99s plans, â\\x80\\x98 then, I suppose I must go by myself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The flowers in the drawing-room are still quite fresh, you know, mamma.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Quite faded, you mean, Joyce. I was absolutely ashamed of them yesterday when the Mileses were here. No; flowers are the one luxury I cannot do withoutâ\\x80\\x94my one indulgence.â\\x80\\x99 Joyce sighed, and said no more. It might be but one luxury, but it was a very expensive one, and a burdensome addition to the weekly bills. When she was able to go with her mother, she contrived to check the expenditure, but it was very seldom that she had the time. She went to the window, and looked idly out in a manner unlike herself. It was, as Mrs. Clayton had said, unusually hot. The window was wide open, and fullTHE CLAYTONS. 79 of mignonette plantsâ\\x80\\x94an outer sun-blind let down. The oppo 172 site houses were in grey shadow, but nothing could soften their inflexible lines, or make them look otherwise than hard and oppressive. In not a few the shutters were closed, and the occupants had escaped from dusty London to the sweet country life of green lanes, and dewy gardens, and delicious hay-fields. One poor little hopeful bird, down in an area, sang with all its might a song of rejoicing over the square bit of blue sky above its cage. The district was not as yet so densely crowded but that glimpses of trees might be caught in and out between the houses, but the roads were new and stony; giant notices of building leases reared themselves up here and there, wherever a little uneven patch of green met the eye; great rubbish deposits marked the places where other rows were soon about to spring; boys hung about the wooden fences surrounding them ; a woman with a glaring white cap rattled her milk- cans noisily down the street; in the distance, a hurdy-gurdy feebly droned over and over again the last new popular air. Joyce turned away from the window, thinking that, over and over again, was the daily burden of life. â\\x80\\x98 Please, Miss Clayton, some gentleman wants to see master or you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Show him into the study, and I will come. It is Mr. May 172 nard, mamma. Joyce ran down the stairs. Hitherto the new church had gone onâ\\x80\\x94very indifferently, to be sureâ\\x80\\x94without instrumental aid; now, however, the harmonium was to represent an organ, and Mr. Maynard the organist. She was not detained quite the length of time she anticipated; but the hurdy-gurdy had ground three times through its tunes before Mr. Maynard finished all he had to say, discussed the place where it could most advan-So ONE YEAR. tageously stand, the merits of certain stops, and the formation of practising classes. It was very wearisome to Joyce, who did not love music sufficiently well to feel enthusiasm for it upon its own account, and only looked upon it in the light of some 172 thing which ought to be done; but, in spite of her feeling, she contrived, as usual, to throw herself heartily into the cause, and to sympathise so brightly with poor Mr. Maynardâ\\x80\\x99s difficulties that he never so much as suspected the penance he was inflict 172 ing upon her. â\\x80\\x98 Twice a week at present, at seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock, in the boysâ\\x80\\x99 school 172 room, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. You may depend upon my being regular, and I dare say my mother will spare our house 172 maid, who has fortunately been taught class-singing at school. Good afternoon, Mr. Maynard. There go two evenings,â\\x80\\x99 groaned poor Joyce disconsolately, as the door closed. â\\x80\\x98It will be a dreadful tie to one, especially now in these delicious long sum 172 mer days, when I do sometimes get a walk with papa; however, the harmonium is a special hobby of his, so that he cannot complain; and if I do not go, those horrid Allens will have it all their own way. Modern Painters! Where did it come from, I wonder? and this is the volume with that grand description of cumuli, and cirrhi, and all the clouds.â\\x80\\x99 Joyce pounced with delight upon the book, buta voice in the hall, very audible through the thin walls, made her utter an exclamation of annoyance, and jump up to look for the silks required for her lesson in church work. The Miss Tinlings were impressible ordinary young ladies, full of admiration for Miss Claytonâ\\x80\\x99s superior talents, and giving vent to their astonish 172 ment in certain stereotyped ejaculations. Joyce laboured through instructions which seemed to her childishly minute as to ribbon and silk and gold braid, and got nothing more satis-THE CLAYTONS. Si factory than, â\\x80\\x98 Oh, fancy ! â\\x80\\x99 from the eldest Miss Tinling, and â\\x80\\x98 Exactly,â\\x80\\x99 from the younger, at the conclusion ; and even the latter word was deprived of the hope it at first conveyed that she was understood, when, in a hesitating voice, she was told that really they felt so afraid that they were quite certain to fail, that they should be most grateful if she would kindly trace the patterns for them upon the ribbon. It was just the difficult part of the whole concern, and Joyce felt infinitely provoked. â\\x80\\x98 If you really want to learn, you had better do it all your 172 selves,â\\x80\\x99 said she severely. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Miss Clayton, I am sure I never could. What, trace all these fine lines? Oh, fancy!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But, indeed, if you would not mind just setting it going so far, and then would kindly give us one more lesson, I really think we might accomplish something. Not like your beautiful work, of courseâ\\x80\\x94that we could not expect ; but ours, if it is not looked at too closely, might do.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Then, you must wait,â\\x80\\x99 Joyce said despairingly ; â\\x80\\x98 I have really very little time to spare.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Exactly. I am sure we often say, Arabella and I, that we wonder how you can possibly get through half what you do. You must be always at work.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Just fancy ! â\\x80\\x99 ejaculated Arabella. â\\x80\\x98 And I am sure if there is anything we could do at any time to help you, if you would show us exactly how you like it done, we would do our very best.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Thank you,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, touched by the real good nature which underlay all these unpromising offers of help, and making up her mind to get up an hour earlier and set the markers in train. The sisters were so charmed with the pleasantness of her82 ONE YEAR. manner, that they lingered some time longer, finally taking leave with many more suggestions of assistance, and assurances of a speedy second visit. Joyce had but time to scribble a hasty note, asking the character of a servant, when Mrs. and Miss Hewitt were announced. Mother and daughter came stiffly into the room, wanting to be set at ease, and evidently disappointed at not finding Mr. Clayton there to befriend them with his genial courtesy. They had come to speak on the subject of Lydia Baker ; but it was so apparent that they could not comfortably enter upon it or any other conversation until the weather, past, present, and future, had been disposed of, that quite five minutes was given up unreservedly to a discussion of its merits, and the heat had been satisfactorily resolved into an imaginary thunder-storm before Joyce ventured to inquire. â\\x80\\x98 Have you made up your mind about Lydia Baker\\' 1 â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98We could not do so altogether without coming to consultâ\\x80\\x94 Mr. Clayton,â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Hewitt was going to say, but stopped, thinking it not quite polite. â\\x80\\x98 Miss Foster recommended us to come,â\\x80\\x99 put in her daughter. * I suppose, after Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour, Miss Foster is averse to her being tried ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, indeed, Miss Clayton. She considers the girl to be weak and easily led ; but, in the sort of situation for which my sister requires her, she would be altogether under the eye of a very steady, respectable person, and Miss Foster believes might do well. Still it is a matter of real consequence, and my hus 172 band is very anxious to know Mr. Claytonâ\\x80\\x99s opinion.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Lydia was in my class, and we were greatly interested in her; but her conduct has been exceedingly bad.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She is very young,â\\x80\\x99 pleaded Mrs. Hewitt, and then stopped confused. It seemed almost a charge against Joyce herself.THE CLAYTONS. 83 â\\x80\\x98She has chosen bad companions; and then came all this Dissenting business, and her impertinence to Miss Foster.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Miss Foster thinks she may not have been altogether ju 172 dicious in her treatment of the girl. She does not wish Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour to herself to be considered.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98But, Mrs. Flewitt, just consider. She has had more ad 172 vantages than one girl out of twenty, and now she makes this return. It is gross ingratitude.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Of course,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Hewitt, hesitating, â\\x80\\x98 if Mr. Clayton thinks â\\x80\\x99 Joyce was honesty itself. â\\x80\\x98Papa does not think so badly of her as I do,â\\x80\\x99 she said; â\\x80\\x98but I am convinced Miss Foster is wrong in still believing in her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Thank you. I will tell my husband. I hope your mamma is well ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Pretty well, thank you ; she has just gone out.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah ! I am afraid she will find it very oppressive.â\\x80\\x99 The weather returned again,- and terminated the conversation. As the mother and daughter walked away from the door, Jane Hewitt said, â\\x80\\x98 As Miss Clayton speaks so decidedly, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t think any more of Lydia Baker, I suppose?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My dear,â\\x80\\x99 said her mother, quietly, â\\x80\\x98 Miss Clayton is very sensible and clever; but she is very young, and, in my ex 172 perience of life, I have found no judges so unmercifully severe as young girls. Miss Foster is a goose; but she has lived longer in the world, knows its trials and temptations, and, if the matter rested with myself, I should abide by her opinion. But your father has only seen her weak side, and I cannot tell how he will wish me to act. Only pray, Jane, donâ\\x80\\x99t condemn everybody whom Miss Clayton dislikes.â\\x80\\x99 C-- 28 4 ONE YEAR. If J oyce could only have heard her ! She had hurried up-stairs, feeling as if at last escape to her own room was possible, but caught even on the road by the little housemaid with inquiries as to the arrangement of certain chairs in Mr. Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s room. Mr. Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s room it remained always, kept for the favourite cousin since the time when he spent his holidays with them, during two years that his father and mother were travelling abroad, and still scarcely less home to him than the Devonshire cottage where he lived with his mother. She was FÃ©licitÃ©, Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s sister. Long ago, when she was very young, Mr. Blunt fell in love with her in Paris, and brought her back to England as his wife. So many years had passed since then, that she had almost ceased to be French in more than birth ; for some time she paid periodical visits to her father and mother, and after their death to her sister ; but she and her husband both grew older, travel 172 ling became wearisome, money more valuable, the visits were discontinued. His death finally threw her into a state of health in which a morbid dread of change became a predominant fancy, and for years nothing had passed between her and Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny except an occasional correspondence, con 172 strained on both sides. Clement was too good a son ever to discuss his motherâ\\x80\\x99s peculiarities ; but J oyce was shrewd enough to put together little trifles, and to make a tolerably correct guess at her character. The relationship to the Claytons was on Mr. Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s side : he and Mrs. Clayton were first cousins, and, as not unfrequently happens, the intimacy was closer in the second generation than the first. When Joyce reached her room, she glanced round her with a sigh of satisfaction. It looked particularly cool and pleasant. Here, as elsewhere in the house, the furniture was as pretty asTHE CLAYTONS. 85 it was simple : a curtainless bed, stained deal chairs and table, a few good illuminations, some admirable photographs in Oxford frames, and a tempting but not particularly tidy book-stand. Joyce had intended, as she told her father, to occupy the short time she knew would be disengaged in thinking over his words, and in trying to find out how much of truth their warning con 172 tained, but she could not concentrate her thoughts. Even with the first attempt there arose a vision of the markers, the shape of the emblems, the colour of the ribbon ; then Clement floated into her head, accompanied by a throb of warm pleasure at the prospect of soon seeing him ; and he was in turn driven out by a recollection of Lydia Bakerâ\\x80\\x99s misdeeds, and an un 172 easy conviction that Mrs. Hewitt was not so deeply impressed by them as she ought to have been. Is it the especial snare of those who enter keenly into what 172 ever occupies them, that the interest clings too closely ? Some such misgiving passed through Joyce Claytonâ\\x80\\x99s mind ; then her eye sought the illuminated text which hung above her dressing- table, and she felt satisfied : â\\x80\\x98 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.â\\x80\\x99 It had been her motto from a childâ\\x80\\x94thoroughness in the smallest matter, were it but the making a pincushion. On her table lay a small photograph ready for tinting, and by its side an open paipt-box. Joyce knew she had just time to do what was required before three little school-girls came for a lesson in knitting. Thinking could be put off till the day was over, and meanwhile she would take advantage of the last rays of the sun and work. It was rest as well to sit where something that deserved to be called fresh air came in at the open window, and where it was not impossible to get a really broad field of sky, without intervening chimneys or the neces-86 ONE YEAR. sity of making the best of smoke by imagining it to be cloud. Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s own face was quite without cloud. Unconsciously, as often happens, her countenance assumed the expression of that she was copying, and looked more subdued and tender than usual. Her eyes were brown, bright, and quick in move 172 ment 3 her hair and eyelashes several shades darker than her eyes ; her complexion clear ; all her actions prompt and alert. She made good progress in her work, and nothing could have been neater or more to the purpose than the few well-chosen touches which her hand bestowed. When the church clock struck seven, and the band which came to the terrace twice a week struck up its first tune from the â\\x80\\x98Barbiere,â\\x80\\x99 Joyce jumped up, looked at her photograph with satisfaction, and hastily put aside her paints. â\\x80\\x98 Now for the stockings,â\\x80\\x99 said she ; â\\x80\\x98 and then either Clement will have arrived, or I shall get a talk with papa.â\\x80\\x99 She peeped into the study on her way down to what she called the parish-room. â\\x80\\x98 I heard you come in, papa.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Does that mean that you are come to take possession ? â\\x80\\x98Not yet. It is stocking-night,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, holding up her knitting-needles, and making a face. â\\x80\\x98Ah! I thought I saw Hannah admit the three Fates. Which represents Atropos ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Why?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Because I shall know to whom I am indebted for dropped stitches. Is your motherâ\\x80\\x99s headache better ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yesâ\\x80\\x94or, at least, I think so,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, correcting herself. â\\x80\\x98 She has gone to the nursery gardens this evening, and I dare say has been kept in Malvern Square.â\\x80\\x99THE CLAYTONS. 87 â\\x80\\x98 Alone ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes; I could not go. Papa, Miss Foster is so weak as to wish the Hewitts to try Lydia Baker at the Childrenâ\\x80\\x99s Con 172 valescent Home.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She is a capital woman, upon my word,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Clayton, with energy. â\\x80\\x98 Half the district visitors in the world would be affronted at that girlâ\\x80\\x99s conduct.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And donâ\\x80\\x99t you think they would be right ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Donâ\\x80\\x99t you see, Joyce, what I admire in her is the way she puts aside personal feelings. She thinks of the people, not of herself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But then she encourages ingratitude ! Papa, I see in your eyes that you will think I was wrong, for I tried to persuade Mrs. Hewitt not to take Lydia. And you know Miss Foster was altogether mistaken about her, last month.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Hum ! The Fates must be growing impatient by this time.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, I know. You are not going out again?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I shall go and meet your mother. And I think it not im 172 possible that I may walk round by the Hewitts. There, be off!â\\x80\\x99 Joyce went down to her three little expectant maidens, not altogether satisfied. She was ready to submit to her father, with a warm proud delight in his superiority; but to have Miss Fosterâ\\x80\\x99s judgment preferred before her own was no slight trialâ\\x80\\x94 Miss Foster, the little, shrinking, undecided woman, who had been as slow to accept the responsibility of district-visiting as she was ready tearfully to acknowledge her mistakes and to accept advice.

I donâ\\x80\\x99t think my mother has suffered from the separation as much as might have been expected until lately : perhaps she always felt it in her power to see my aunt, if it was necessary, and now, for the first time, begins to dread the possibility of their never meeting again. At all events, she has been quite miserable about it lately, distressed at my not having seen her since I was a small boy, and so anxious to have a really correct account from an eye 172 witness of her state of health and condition, that there was nothing for it but for me to give clients the slip, pack my port 172 manteau, and here I am on my way to Dieppe.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But you must have been thinking about it for some time past ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Thinking about itâ\\x80\\x94yes.

For a longtime my mother wrote regularly, and went to see them whenever she and my father were in France ; but, first of all, Madame Laget died, and then her husband wrote but seldom. They had but one childâ\\x80\\x94Marie, and she married, whom we have never been able to find out; and at last, when old Laget died himself, all the links seemed broken.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98There is a romance lying in wait for you somewhere, Clement,â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton said. â\\x80\\x98 But, to return to your aunt, do you imagine her circumstances to be good ? â\\x80\\x98 Indifferently so, I dare say. She never alludes in her letters to anything which should make us think the contrary. She speaks of her salon and her pleasant view, and dwells a good deal upon living au pretnier ; so I suppose she is sufficiently comfortable.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, I think your mother is right, and that it is high time you should go and look after your relations. Blood is thicker than water. And I tell you what you may do. You young men of the present day are so abominably narrow-minded about your Gothic vagaries, you will look at nothing else. When you are at Dieppe, just take a walk to Varengeville, and bring back word whether you donâ\\x80\\x99t acknowledge that poor despised Renaissance has something to say for itself after all. Such medallions as those to be called worthless, indeed ! â\\x80\\x99 Clement made a face, which argued ill for an unprejudiced opinion. â\\x80\\x98 Do you cross to-morrow ? â\\x80\\x99 inquired Mrs. Clayton. â\\x80\\x98No. Business keeps me in town all day, so I shall take the early boat the following morning.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then you shall come to-morrow evening to the school, andE VER Y-DA Y D US T. 95 hear our first attempt to soar into the realms of harmony,â\\x80\\x99 announced Joyce. Â£ With an accompaniment, that is,â\\x80\\x99 put in Mr. Clayton, sotto vocc. â\\x80\\x98With many accompaniments,â\\x80\\x99 corrected Joyce: â\\x80\\x98papaâ\\x80\\x99s sense and Mr. Maynardâ\\x80\\x99s science; Miss Allenâ\\x80\\x99s sensibility and Miss Claytonâ\\x80\\x99s smattering; two little boys, who have actually been proved to have once sung the first line of a hymn rightly ; and, finally, our great backbone, a harmonium.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Very nice,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Blunt, absently. Everybody laughed. â\\x80\\x98Come and have some dinner: I hear Hannah taking it into the dining-room,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Clayton, compassionately. Clementâ\\x80\\x99s privileges in the house were those of a son and brother. He had won Mr. Claytonâ\\x80\\x99s heart when he first came to them as a little holiday school-boy, by some resemblance, real or fancied, to a boyâ\\x80\\x94older than Joyceâ\\x80\\x94whom they had lost at about the same age. Mrs. Clayton was very well disposed to like any one who fell in her way, and whom she was expected to like; Joyce was delighted to have a fresh person to pet her, and, perhaps still more, to find some one with whom she could occasionally quarrel ; and Clement, since the first month, had always been at home with his cousins, although, during the last year or two, they had seen little of him, especially since he had set up at Defforton as a lawyer. His mother kept him very closely with her, and Devonshire was too far from London to be convenient for Mr. Claytonâ\\x80\\x99s annual holiday. No one could have been a better son than Clement, and that under trying circumstances. The same weight of selfish 172 ness seemed to have rested on the French sisters; but if it preponderated in either, it was in Mrs. Blunt, owing, probably,96 ONE YEAR to the easier life she had led. She was capricious and self- pleasing to a degree, violent when thwarted, and expecting immediate obedience to her most unreasonable demands. Clement deserved great credit for yielding readily, when he felt that non-compliance did not rest upon a question of right or wrong, and for, on more than one occasion, displaying a firmness which was as little irritating to his mother as he could make it. It was not his fault if his course of life was not, perhaps, the most advantageous for the formation of his charac 172 terâ\\x80\\x94rather, I should say, if it did not appear so to human eyes ; for our own judgments on such matters are too one-sided to be trust-worthy, and well it is for us that the Hand which guides our path leads onwards in unerring love, in spite of our weak, resisting murmurs. Joyce indulged, that evening, in her nearest approach to idle 172 nessâ\\x80\\x94knitting; as they all sat, in the cool twilight, round the open window, and the scent of the freshly watered mignonette stole into the room. She underwent a good deal of bantering from Clement on the subject of her many avocations, but she took it all with good-humoured equanimity that evidently de 172 lighted him ; and, indeed, the kindly, pleasant atmosphere was infinitely refreshing to him after the perpetual fret of his own home. â\\x80\\x98 I declare,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98 in spite of trees, birds, and country skies, this is a great improvement upon the Rectory, where last evening we all sat out in the garden until ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You have told us nothing about the girls,â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Clayton said, reproachfully. â\\x80\\x98 Dear Mrs. Clayton, it is a subject I venture upon with awe, especially if I am to deliver all the cousinly messages with which I am charged.â\\x80\\x99E VER V-DA V D UST. 97 â\\x80\\x98 To be sure ! I have been wondering at not hearing. What are the children growing up like?â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Clayton, laying down her worsted work, and looking greatly interested. â\\x80\\x98 What is Elsie like ? â\\x80\\x99 interrupted Joyce. â\\x80\\x98You have asked me the question of the village, to which no one has ever yet been found able to give a satisfactory answer. I have heard people severally express their firm convictions that they are growing up into bears, boys, and blues. Mind you, I say nothing of the sort myself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Poor children ! a good deal may be forgiven them,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Clayton. â\\x80\\x98 How old is Anne ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Eighteen, as I know by reason of her birthday being yester 172 day, and my having to eat a lump of heavy, indigestible cake, which she had manufactured herself according to the family fashion.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then she is out ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Out ! I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what she is out ofâ\\x80\\x94not ungainliness, I assure you. I believe poor Anne would thankfully return to short frocks, and leave the world and its troubles to Elsie.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And Elsie ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Wonderfully pretty ; growing more so every day ; but as shy as a hawk. Bella, though she is but fourteen, is the most popular of the party ; and very bad it is for her. I am con 172 vinced there is twice the good in Anne and Elsie that there is in Bella. There is always something about her that is not above-board. She sent her love to dear Aunt Emily and Cousin Joyce, and longs so much to see them again. That meant, she would much like an invitation to London. Elsie was in the room, and I saw her give Miss Bella a look. I am sure that was the reason she sent no message herself : she said she could not see the use of people sending love over and over 19 8 ONE YEAR. again : if your friends knew that they had it, they could not want to be so often reminded.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She never will do it in a letter,â\\x80\\x99 put in Joyce. â\\x80\\x98 Go on, Clement,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Clayton. â\\x80\\x98 Walter is still at Marlborough, and Rose is a strange, inde 172 pendent little monkey. There ! I think I have finished the junior branches. As to Mr. Follaton, you know, Mrs. Clayton, that he never changes; and Miss Villars is as good, as self- sacrificing, and as undecided as ever.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Which tyrannises over her the most now?â\\x80\\x99 asked Joyce. â\\x80\\x98 Bella.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 From what you say of that young lady,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Clayton, making up his mind with a sigh, â\\x80\\x98 it seems to me it might be as well for us to take her hint, and have her here for a time. What do you say, Emily ? â\\x80\\x99 Joyce looked up in dismay, caught her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s expression, and checked the words of remonstrance which were on hef tongue. â\\x80\\x98 Certainly, my dear,â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Clayton answered placidly. â\\x80\\x98Would your brother consent?â\\x80\\x99 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know, I am sure. I suppose not.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Mr. Follaton is difficult to move when once he has made up his mind,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, glancing at Mrs. Clayton, and thinking how unlike was her mild, easy-going character to the shy, stu 172 dious brother. â\\x80\\x98 But if you do carry out these benevolent inten 172 tions, I can assure you that your charity will be put to the prooÃ¹ By the way, I had forgotten what might answer the same pur 172 pose in another mannerâ\\x80\\x94one of the special messages with which I am charged, and this from Miss Villars, is the hope that Joyce will pay them a long visit as soon as she feels inclined.â\\x80\\x99 A long â\\x80\\x98 oh!â\\x80\\x99 in the form of a groan, broke from Joyce.E VER Y-DA Y D US T. 99 â\\x80\\x98 That would be very nice for you, my dear,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Clay 172 ton. â\\x80\\x98 Why do you say, â\\x80\\x9c oh â\\x80\\x9d?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I beg your pardon, Clement. I believe I was only thinking of your description of that horrid child. I should not really mind it: the Rectory is very pretty, and I used to like Elsie.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I see Joyce valiantly aflame as defender of Miss Villars, and general opposer of tyranny,â\\x80\\x99 said her cousin, laughing. â\\x80\\x98 Thank you; but you will not have that gratification. I could not possibly go.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Why not, Joyce?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Papa ! why, only think of the hundred and fifty irons there are in the fire just now.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My dear, you alarm me ! A tenth of the number would be sufficient to burn our fingers. Clement,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Clayton, rub 172 bing his cheek ruefully, â\\x80\\x98can you form any conception of the misery of our condition?â\\x80\\x94July in London, and Joyce engaged in the multiplication of irons.â\\x80\\x99 A little out of countenance, she said, â\\x80\\x98You know, papa, there is always a great deal to be done ; my going away just how is simply impracticable.â\\x80\\x99 Then, as he only answered â\\x80\\x98Hum! â\\x80\\x99 she continued, â\\x80\\x98 The harmonium, to begin with.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I never knew you cared about music,â\\x80\\x99 said her cousin. â\\x80\\x98Nor do I; but somebody must attend to it, and mamma de 172 clares the buzz of a harmonium makes her quite ill. So what is to be done?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98The Allens.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If the Allens get the arrangement of things into their hands, papa, all will start wrong. Mr. Maynard is very doubtful of himself, so much so that if he is not backed up we shall be having double chants and all sorts of atrocities.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Joyce has set her heart upon Gregorians, Clement. Ah, IIOO ONE YEAR. donâ\\x80\\x99t wonder at your making a face ; we shall be a very de 172 pressed congregation under their influence.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I range myself among the Allen faction from this moment.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, there is no faction. You know papa better than to expect to find such a thing in his parish. If he would only honestly like them himself, no one would think of opposing him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I should like to see Mr. Clayton brought into contact with our stiff-backed old Elmwood farmers. I wonder whether they would be as amenable.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 They canâ\\x80\\x99t be worse than Parker, the greengrocer,â\\x80\\x99 Joyce said triumphantly, â\\x80\\x98and papa has quite brought him round. Clement, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t have you disliking Gregorians ; you shall come to the practice to-morrow.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My teeth will be set on edge for a week!â\\x80\\x99 However, he made no further objection. That night Joyce went up to her room feeling the fatigue of a busy day, and not a little of its excitement. In the after 172 noon, she had put off graver thoughts until she could have the undisturbed quiet of night to assist her in dwelling upon them ; now that time had come, they seemed as far out of reach as ever. A hundred distracting fancies flitted through her brain, whenever she tried to turn her thoughts inwardâ\\x80\\x94dreams of use 172 fulness, it is true, plans of charity, active work, but none the less absorbing and exciting, and opposed to self-examination. As she prayed, her mind wandered away, and several times she recalled it with a start. As she read, she thought of what she would do and say the next day. Joyce was too sincere and honest-hearted not to feel a pang of self-reproach as she col 172 lected her attention ; but she contented herself with the feeling, and did not pursue it deeper. It was very true that her plansE VER Y-DA Y D UST IOI were useful, her wishes good; none the less did she need to watch and pray, lest Â£ cumbered with much serving,â\\x80\\x99 Maryâ\\x80\\x99s better part might not be hers. The weather on the next day was as hot, though less sunny, and Mrs. Hewittâ\\x80\\x99s predicted thunder-storm showed signs of approach. Joyce would very much have liked to have spent the early part of the morning, before her cousin went off to the city, at home with him ; but having promised to see some sick people at that time, she gave up her own wishes without a murmur. Coming out of one of the houses, she met Miss Foster. â\\x80\\x98Oh, Miss Clayton,â\\x80\\x99 began the little woman hurriedly, â\\x80\\x98I wanted so much to see you. I am so afraid you may be an 172 noyed about that poor Lydia Baker.â\\x80\\x99 Poor Miss Fosterâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98 sos â\\x80\\x99 were a continual irritation to Joyce. â\\x80\\x98I am not in the least annoyed,â\\x80\\x99 she said; â\\x80\\x98but I think you are all treating that girl a great deal better than she deserves.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I do really thinkâ\\x80\\x94I canâ\\x80\\x99t be sure, of courseâ\\x80\\x94I dare say you know bestâ\\x80\\x94only I canâ\\x80\\x99t help thinking there is some good in her,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Foster, hesitating painfully between her desire to mediate for Lydia Baker and her fear of seeming to oppose her clergymanâ\\x80\\x99s daughter. â\\x80\\x98 She has not shown much of it,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, sturdily. â\\x80\\x98No ? donâ\\x80\\x99t you think so ? She has always seemed to me to be so good to that old aunt of hers. And donâ\\x80\\x99t you think she is truthful ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Papa says you have been very good to her, at all events.â\\x80\\x99 Miss Fosterâ\\x80\\x99s face beamed all over with pleasure. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, thank you,â\\x80\\x99 she said ; â\\x80\\x98I am so relieved to know he does not disapprove.â\\x80\\x99102 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Is she going to Jdrs. Hewittâ\\x80\\x99s sister, then ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No ; Mr. Hewitt says he will not risk it. I believe Mr. Clayton was good enough to see him last night on the subject ; but Mr. Hewitt had made up his mind, and he is very deter 172 mined.â\\x80\\x99 I cannot but say that Mr. Hewitt went up several steps in Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s opinion by this deference to her judgment; she said, a little triumphantly, â\\x80\\x98I was sure it would not be safe. Then, what is to be done ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I have not decided. I wanted to consult you first of all ; but I have some idea of taking her myself. You know, my little maid has to leave me. It is not settled,â\\x80\\x99 said poor Miss Foster, trying to find some shield for her own imprudence. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Miss Foster ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Do you really think I am wrong ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98It is offering a premium for ingratitude to all the school 172 girls.â\\x80\\x99 The little woman sighed. She did not think her own single- handed place quite formed a premium. She was grieved beyond measure to oppose Miss Clayton ; but her heart yearned over the poor, ignorant, headstrong orphan, and she would not desert her. â\\x80\\x98 I hope you will not mind ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Of course, I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind,â\\x80\\x99Joyce answered magnanimously; â\\x80\\x98 I am only sorry for you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, that is nothing,â\\x80\\x99 Miss Foster said, her little faded face lighting up with eagerness. â\\x80\\x98 I can do so little.â\\x80\\x99 Joyce thought, on her way home, that she was the best of little women, and only wanted common sense, by which, it is possible, she meant a reliance upon herâ\\x80\\x94Joyce Claytonâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94E VER Y-DA Y D US T. 103 judgment. But without this common sense she felt sure she would do great mischief in the district. â\\x80\\x98 Papa, all the world would be spoiled with sugar-plums if Miss Foster had things her own way !â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed that after 172 noon, looking up from letter-writing. Mr. Clayton did not answer; he was thinking of Joyce, and not of Miss Foster. He could not help fearing that her cha 172 racter was losing, instead of gaining, the self-control and resting power which he believed it specially needed. Action, energy, the work of the outer life, had for her so great a charm, it seemed to leave no space for the inner. Her father hesitated as to his own conduct. He might by a word have forbidden her to take part in many things that now absorbed her; but he was un 172 willing harshly to check the spring of bright usefulness which carried in it so much that was good ; besides, hers was a nature which could scarcely be restrained from continual activity by any external trammels : she could and would obediently refrain from doing anything to which her father objected, but a hundred other things would instantly fill up the void. No ; Mr. Clayton made up his mind, with a sigh, that J oyce had arrived at an age when, in such a conscience-rratter as this, the control must come from herself, and that he could do no more than help her to the discovery that it was needed. The cousins set out together that evening for the school-room, Clement giving himself the airs of a victim, and Joyce ruthlessly determined that he should endure everything that was to be endured. She would not see his piteously appealing expres 172 sion when the Miss Allens took him under their especial patron 172 age, and poured out their admiration of his voice, and their fears that Mr. Maynard might be a little too severe in his choice of music. When he had effected an escape, he watched with104 ONE YEAR. amusement his cousinâ\\x80\\x99s small, resolute figure standing by the harmonium, and evidently making her steady influence felt upon the rather discursively inclined assemblage. With less knowledge of music than either of the assistants, she gave more useful help than any of the others ; so that when Mr. Clayton arrived towards the end of the hour, he found actual practice going on, and even the Miss Allens toned down to sober work. His hearty sympathy always acted as a stimulus, and sent them away in spirits. Mr. Maynard could not but be aware for how much he was indebted to Joyce, and made her a little formal speech to that effect ; and on their way home, in answer to her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s inquiring â\\x80\\x98Well?â\\x80\\x99 she looked up with a bright, eager smile. â\\x80\\x98We mean to be a grand success, papa. Walter Brett really has a capital voice.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How did you manage your own ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Opened my mouth and sang mutely. My croak would have been too prominent among so few to have passed unnoticed. But I think you might offer Clement a small salary if he would take a permanent place in the choir.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Thank you. I can only say, Joyce, I am glad you donâ\\x80\\x99t live at the Rectory. However, I am magnanimous enough to congratulate you. You acted like the fairy Order whom I learnt to respect in my childhood.â\\x80\\x99 Joyce laughed; the subject was changed, and she chatted as pleasantly and intelligently about the last Academy Exhibition as if singing-classes and parochial troubles had never existed. She thoroughly enjoyed that evening, when she could listen to conversation she liked, and hear politics discussed with some difference of opinion, and yet with thorough cordiality of ex 172 pression.E VER Y-DA Y D US T. Clement wished them all good-bye that evening. He was obliged to start in the middle of the night, his cousin declared, in order to catch the early steamer for Dieppe ; and as he in 172 tended returning by a different route, they were not likely soon to see him again. But he suggested to Joyce that there was the Elmwood invitation remaining open for herself.CHAPTER VII. A NEW FRIENDSHIP. Oh, boy ! of such as thou are oftenest made Earthâ\\x80\\x99s fragile idols ; like a tender flower, No strength in all thy freshness, prone to fade, And bending weakly to the thunder-shower ; Still, round the loved thy heart found force to bind, And clung like woodbine shaken in the wind ! Hon. Mrs. Norton. \\\\ SWITHIN was favourable, and Clement Blunt had a delightful passage. When he landed, his first step was to procure breakfast, for he felt a convic- hungry young Englishman would scarcely prove a welcome visitor to his aunt at such an hour of the morning. His next was to find out her house, and in this he had little difficulty. He turned up a little passage at the back of the hotel, stopped for a few minutes to look at the exquisite ivory carvings in the shops, and found himself in the main street. Referring to a letter in his pocket, and asking his way in French so perfect that the man he accosted was left in a state of be 172 wilderment between Clementâ\\x80\\x99s appearance and accent, he soonA NEW FRIENDSHIP. found himself under the dark arch which led the unwary visitor over broken pavement and hidden pitfalls into the Sansonsâ\\x80\\x99 house. He stumbled through a narrow passage into the open court already mentioned, and knocking at the door of the little glazed room, was immediately confronted by Madame Sanson. It is impossible to conceive anything greater than her surprise in hearing a strange gentleman ask, in a voice as calm as if it were an every-day occurrence, for Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny. â\\x80\\x98 Is it Madame you wantâ\\x80\\x94Madame ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She lives here, does she not ? â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, smiling at the evident astonishment his demand created. â\\x80\\x98 But yesâ\\x80\\x94yes, certainly. Is Monsieur acquainted with her ? â\\x80\\x99 * I am a relation.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 A relation ! â\\x80\\x99 Madameâ\\x80\\x99s hands, shoulders, eyes, were all in movement. â\\x80\\x98 She has so few friends ; Monsieur does not come from these parts ? â\\x80\\x99 It was plain that Mr. Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s history would be extracted before any corresponding information was bestowed in return, and he resigned himself good-humouredly to his fate. â\\x80\\x98 No, indeed,â\\x80\\x99 he said ; â\\x80\\x98 I have just come from England.â\\x80\\x99 * From England ! Ah-h-h ! that accounts for Monsieurâ\\x80\\x99s foreign air ; but yet he speaks altogether like a Frenchman ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am half a Frenchman, if that will explain the mystery.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And a relation of Madameâ\\x80\\x99s? Does she expect Monsieur?â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Blunt grew impatient. â\\x80\\x98 Upon my word,â\\x80\\x99 he thought, â\\x80\\x98 I had better adopt a little counter-questioning. My aunt does not expect me ; will you kindly let her know that I am here ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Your aunt ! Monsieur is Madameâ\\x80\\x99s own nephew ! Is it possible ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Can I see her ? â\\x80\\x99 continued poor Clement, in despair â\\x80\\x98 Sanson,â\\x80\\x99 cried Madame, running nimbly back to her hus-io8 ONE YEAR. band, â\\x80\\x98 figure to yourself, there is a gentleman, beautiful as a picture, describing himself as our Madameâ\\x80\\x99s nephew.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Come,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement to himself, â\\x80\\x98 this wonâ\\x80\\x99t do. At the rate we are going on, I shall spend a few hours in detailing my history. I had better go up at once, while this wonderful little old woman is in her glass house. What a magnificent staircase ! If my auntâ\\x80\\x99s rooms are en suite, the cottage will offer few attrac 172 tions.â\\x80\\x99 He ran upstairs, and knocked gently at the door which opened on the landing. Receiving no answer, he tried again and again, but without better success. Finally, he turned the handle of the door. It was locked, and he uttered an exclamation of dis 172 appointment. â\\x80\\x98 She must be out ; how tiresome ! and what wonderfully early hours she keeps. It puts me in something of a fix, since, if I go down again, I shall be an hour in extract 172 ing a definite answer from that old woman ; and if there is a thing I canâ\\x80\\x99t stand, it is the not getting a plain answer to a plain question. Ah, here she comes again,â\\x80\\x99 as a shrill * Monsieur ! â\\x80\\x99 was heard ascending from the court. â\\x80\\x98I shall go up another stage, and see what I can hear there.â\\x80\\x99 The second stage was like the first, and Clement, pausing a moment to look up at the blue sky, and to note the peculiari 172 ties of the staircase, knocked again at a door exactly resembling that which he had unsuccessfully tried below. This time he had better fortune ; a languid voice said, â\\x80\\x98 Entrez\\', and he found himself confronting a low couch, on which lay a boy looking so fragile and unearthly, that Clement absolutely started at the sight. Louis was as much astonished as his visitor. He raised him 172 self on his arm, and stared in wonder, until the gentleman, recovering himself, said with a short laugh, â\\x80\\x98 I beg your pardon. I am altogether in a strange land here, and you will be doingClement at the sick-bed oj Louis. P. 109A NE IV FRIENDSHIP. me a kindness to direct me.

I thought she never left this house.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She has not for many years ; but, two days ago, she went to Rouen.â\\x80\\x99 Clement looked and felt terribly disconcerted. â\\x80\\x98 Is she really gone ? â\\x80\\x99 he said, with an effort to be incredulous. Louis smiled. â\\x80\\x98 My sister is gone with her. I suppose you are one of Madameâ\\x80\\x99s English relations ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, in a pondering tone. He was thinking that he had got into an old enchanted castle, and that here was the captive knight laid under a spell in the turret-chamber. There was something in the house unlike the ordinary places where he found himself ; and Louisâ\\x80\\x99 refined, delicate face be 172 longed more to shadow-land than reality. â\\x80\\x98 I beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x99 he said, rousing himself, and aware that the ladâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were fixed upon him in surprise ; but do you live here by yourself? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, no, indeed,â\\x80\\x99 said Louis, with a smile, which broke out involuntarily at the idea ; â\\x80\\x98 I have Ursuleâ\\x80\\x94my sister. Only, as I tell you, she has gone to Rouen with Madame. Monsieur must be much vexed to come so far in vain. They will not be absent many days.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah ! â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, brightening. â\\x80\\x98 Then matters might be worse after all. My poor boy, you must be very desolate ; who takes care of you ? â\\x80\\x99 he continued, in a tone of compassion. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I have Madame Sansonâ\\x80\\x94our good Madame down-stairs.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98The little old woman who asks questions?\\' â\\x80\\x98 I dare say it puzzled her to see you,â\\x80\\x99 said Louis, understand 172 ing the state of the case in a moment.I 10 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Blunt, laughing, â\\x80\\x98 I ought not to blame her; for I feel as if I must ask a great many questions myself before my ideas can be cleared of cloud. You are sure I anÂ» not tiring you ? â\\x80\\x99 He was himself so strong and vigorous that it shocked him to see how fragile the boy looked, and how his cheek flushed with the slight exertion of talking ; but there was no mistaking the tone of pleasure in which Louis answered, â\\x80\\x98 No, indeed. Pray do not go.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 First of all, then, tell me your name.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Louis Lafon.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Mine is Bluntâ\\x80\\x94Clement Blunt. Now we shall know one another better. Andâ\\x80\\x94and have you been long ill ? â\\x80\\x99 He had not intended questioning the boy about himself ; but there was a strange fascination to him in the sweet, almost womanly expression, unlike anything he had seen before. â\\x80\\x98 I have always been as I am.â\\x80\\x99 It was said quite simply, and without any attempt at self-pity ; and Clement felt as if it would be almost an impertinence for himself to venture upon any 172 thing of the kind. â\\x80\\x98 Then you know my aunt well ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny ? Oh, yes.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What is she like ?â\\x80\\x94I have never seen her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Nor I, Monsieur. I can only imagine her through Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s description.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Surely we are not meaning the same person ! I thought she lived here ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is quite true ; but Monsieur sees I remain up here always.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She can come up, I suppose ? â\\x80\\x99 Louis laughed merrily. â\\x80\\x98 Monsieur does not, indeed, know Madame ! She has never been up here in her life.â\\x80\\x99A NE I V FRIENDSHIP. in Clement began to make up his mind to be astonished by nothing in this strange house. His eye was caught by the sketches, and he fell to speculating whose they could be. The pictures and the delicately featured boy were equally out of keeping with the bare, poorly furnished room ; nor did he sufficiently take into account the refining power of illness. He was, however, so much afraid of this, to him, unknown enemy, that it alarmed him to see the tired look in Louisâ\\x80\\x99 face ; and he got up hastily to go, promising to return in the afternoon. There was not much chance of successfully avoiding being caught at the foot of the stairs by Madame, whose little round figure, indeed, was keeping watch at her door; but Clement was beginning to understand the state of affairs better, and was not unwilling to spend a little time in answering the re 172 mainder of her questions, and in listening to her shrewd remarks. She took care to impress him with her views on the subject of her lodgers, acknowledging, at the same time, that Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny had her good points, and was much to be pitied. â\\x80\\x98 She has eaten her own heart, poor thing, so long, that there is not too much left. Well, well, we all laugh at this one, and find fault with that; but I sometimes say to Jules, â\\x80\\x9cYou have your chocolate, and your soup, and your claret, and no wonder that you are amiable and satisfied ; and I have my market, and my little gossip, and my house to look after, and the children up-stairs almost as good as my own, and how can we know what those poor things feel who are without any such dis 172 tractions ? â\\x80\\x99 Clement felt as if there was some reproach to him in the words, although he had frequently tried to induce his mother to take measures for communication with her sister, and in vain.I 12 ONE YEAR. She told him, querulously, that one day she intended to go herself, and meanwhile he need say no more. That day had never, and now would never, come, and the two separated lives grew more apart each year. Clement was a good son ; he felt a desire, in some manner, to make up for his motherâ\\x80\\x99s neglect, more and more so, as he extracted from Madame the particu 172 lars of his auntâ\\x80\\x99s mode of life, and felt that only rigid poverty could produce such absolute absence of comfort. Madame, on her part, lost her affections to the healthy-looking young Englishman; she embedded him at once in a soft, romantic little corner of her heart, which had been vacant ever since Pierre Renaitâ\\x80\\x99s prudent but inconstant conduct had made her secretly indignant against him, while outwardly she was loud in his praises. There was a steadfast look in Clement Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, very different from Pierreâ\\x80\\x99s rather shifting expression. But, as he went out of the archway into the sunny, busy street again, the gravity stole over his face which was most habitual to it ; whether it was owing to living so much alone, as far as his inner life was concerned, or to the continual self- control which he required to exercise over his temper. He walked quickly on, although there was no cause for hurry, and he found himself by-and-by on the high land behind the old castle, and obliged to make rather an adventurous descent in order to reach the beach. A high westerly wind and a brilliant sun made the scene there as bright and animated as it was possible for it to be. The sea was of that peculiar green tint so often noticeable at Dieppe, growing darker and darker towards the horizon. The waves tossed themselves into white breakers, not angrily, but as if in play with the sea-birds which dipped grace 172 fully into the foam, their wings becoming silvery in the sunshine. Two women were chattering busily over their occupation, thatA NE W FRIENDSHIP. of spreading nets to dry upon the stones ; one of them wore a high white cap, scarlet petticoat, blue shawl and apron ; chil 172 dren were shouting merrily against the wind, and the waves rolled noisily up the shingle. It was anything but a solitary resort, for far on to where the long pier, with its beacon-tower, ran out to sea at the entrance to the harbour, men, women, and children, of all ages and classes, were dotted over the shore; one or two ladies had sat down to enjoy the air, sheltering themselves from the wind behind umbrellas. Something in the strong salt wind, in the clear atmosphere, and the bright colours provoked cheerfulness ; even the great boats, which in various stages of building and dismantlement were dragged up on the beach, were decked with flags to make their gaunt ribs look less gloomy. The sea was dotted all over with fishing-boats as far as the eye could reach, part of the fleet of which the town is justly proud. Looking in the other direction, away from Dieppe, the white cliffs seemed to Clement almost provokingly home-like, so closely did they resemble the English coast ; and he needed to turn round and reconsider the most picturesque of the costumes to assure himself that he was indeed in a foreign country. Clement Blunt deserved high praise for the manner in which he had toiled away in a small country office, first giving up his favourite dream of entering the army, and then relinquishing all hope of the bar, because his mother could not endure to think of the time he must then necessarily have spent in London. It is possible that he might have risen high in that profession, as his quickness and readiness were great ; but, if his talents did not meet with fair play in his position at Defforton, the ad 172 vantage to his moral character had been incalculable. He had gained the comparative steadiness of application and regularity 8ii4 ONE YEAR. in work, which was what he most needed, and without which it it is probable that all his more brilliant qualities would have failed; and he learned to reason closely, instead of doing no more than jumping at intuitions with feminine quickness and feminine want of logic. He was thinking now of his homeâ\\x80\\x94thinking of the father who had been at once father and dearest friend, and whose loss every day of his life made only more apparent ; thinking of the weariness, and disappointment, and want of sympathy that he felt too often now, as he had never before feltâ\\x80\\x94of the brothers and sisters who had come before him, one by one taken away in infancy and childhood. It was not often that he had leisure time so thoroughly unoccupied as the present, and he sat down on the shingle and buried his head in his hands. That he suffered greatly from the struggle to reconcile his motherâ\\x80\\x99s capricious and jealous temper with the duty and affection he owed to her, any kind clear-headed friend who lived on the spot would have easily seen ; but, unfortunately, there was no one exactly in the position to remark or to help him in his trouble. Mr. Clayton had a better idea of it than any other person ; but even he had not seen Clement and his mother together since Mr. Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s death, and did not know what a constant fret was imposed upon the young manâ\\x80\\x99s spirits. At times the longing to break away had proved almost irre 172 sistible, the more so when he allowed himself to think that he would really gain a great deal which now was to all appearance denied him. Mrs. Blunt was one of those persons with whom it is the present, and not the absent, who are always in the wrong ; those who were separated from her by death or absence she endowed with all the virtues she had denied to them when they were near her. It was not that she did not love her oneA NEW FRIENDSHIP. â\\x80\\x9d5 remaining son, but it was that the habit of her life impelled her to continual fault-finding. Failures on Clementâ\\x80\\x99s part there had beenâ\\x80\\x94many and great failuresâ\\x80\\x94which had caused him hours of shame and self-reproach; but none the less had he fought his way through sharp struggles to a victory over self more complete than he himself believed, and it was no undeserved praise which the neighbours gave when they spoke of him emphatically as a good son. Nevertheless, it was always a time of trial when he ventured upon a comparison between the Claytonsâ\\x80\\x99 home and his own. There are hours in a manâ\\x80\\x99s life when nature speaks more plainly than books, and something of the feeling came to Cle 172 ment Blunt when he lifted his head and looked out over the water on that exquisite summer morning. The great boundless sea swept away petty repinings and discontent into full, deep assurance of the protecting Love which permits all things to be ennobled for its sake; the bright sunlight called up hope; even the clouds only brought the thought that they were but fleeting vapours, permitted for a time to dim the brightness. I suppose that few men, or women either, can look, as Clement looked, at sea and sky and remain wholly unmoved. He drew his breath deeply; and when at last he rose up to go, it was with the thankful feeling that strength had been sent to him in that hour of silent teaching. He went back to the hotel, engaged rooms there for a few days, wrote letters during the remainder of the morning, and, when the afternoon came, set off according to his promise to see Louis again. The boy interested him more than he could account for, and called up all his feelings of compassion. He made up his mind that Ursule was a giddy girl, thinking only of her own pleasures so that she was ready to leave her brother 8â\\x80\\x942ONE YEAR. in his suffering and solitude, and set off without compunction to enjoy herself. It did not alter his opinion to hear the mingled pride and love with which Louis expatiated upon her. â\\x80\\x98She is so fresh, so bright, so graceful, no one would ever suppose her to be my sister,â\\x80\\x99 said he, enthusiastically. â\\x80\\x98 I can 172 not tell you how strange it seems to me to talk of Ursule to any one who does not know her. Everything comes to me through her, if you understand.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, indeed, my poor boy ! â\\x80\\x99 Louisâ\\x80\\x99 cheek flushed. â\\x80\\x98 Do not pity me for that,â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98It is a hundred times better to enjoy it with her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ursule is a strange name,â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Blunt said, ponderingly, â\\x80\\x98and yet it seems familiar to me in some shape or other.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is a name which has long belonged to us. My motherâ\\x80\\x99s mother was called Ursule.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is not possible, then, that I can know it as in any way con 172 nected with you,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, smiling ; â\\x80\\x98 but it certainly strikes me as having to do with something which I ought to remember and cannot. Now I want to speak about yourself. Do you never see a doctor ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I have not seen one for a long time. Doctors can do me no good, Monsieur.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You cannot be sure of that,â\\x80\\x99 Clement said, a little peremp 172 torily ; â\\x80\\x98 and your sister ought to take care that you have the chance.â\\x80\\x99 Louis was greatly distressed. â\\x80\\x98You do not know Ursule!â\\x80\\x99 he exclaimed ; and this shadow of blame gave him such evident pain, that Mr. Blunt avoided, through the rest of the visit, ex 172 pressing anything which seemed to reproach her with neglect, although in his own mind he still charged her with iâ\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 he said soothingly, â\\x80\\x98I dare say she and you are bothA NEW FRIENDSHIP. 117 so used to your state that you think nothing can alter it. But skilful surgeons do wonders ; â\\x80\\x99 and he went on to narrate the particulars of a case with which he was acquainted, in which a boy a year or two younger than Louis had received a wonderful cure under the hands of a famous medical man. Glancing up as he drew towards the end of his story, and expecting to find the large dark eyes bent eagerly upon him, he was struck with the look of patient resignation which he met instead. He had hoped to rouse the boy into hopefulness, but he had evidently not succeeded, and he stumbled hastily over his last words to ask, â\\x80\\x98 What do you think of that ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How thankful his mother must have been ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But about yourself ; why should not the same treatment be successful ? â\\x80\\x99 Louis answered him, without a trace of agitation in his voice, â\\x80\\x98 Because it is too late.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How can you tell ? Every means ought to be tried â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I wonder if I could tell you,â\\x80\\x99 interrupted Louis, with more emotion : â\\x80\\x98 I do not speak of it to Ursule, and there is no one else. To tell anything to Madame is a sure means of having it known. But sometimes I feel a longing, a craving, to speak to some one. I ought to be able to bear my own burden, but I am so weakâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Tell me anything; it shall be quite safe,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, compassionately, as the boy stopped. â\\x80\\x98Yes; I see that in your face. Well, it is not much; it is only poor Ursule who will be the worse. But you talked to me about getting well, and I know, I feel, that I am dying. It is better, sometimes, to put it into plain words,â\\x80\\x99 he went on hurriedly, seeing that Clement looked shocked and was trying to speak. â\\x80\\x98And I do not fear it now. I used to fancy thatONE YEAR. one day I might get better, and then it seemed hard, and made me impatient. Now that I \\'feel how mistaken I was, and that at the best I could be no more than what I am, I know that it is all mercy.\\' His voice was quite calm, and as he concluded there came over his face such a look of peace and trustfulness that Mr. Blunt dared not at once disturb it. But in a minute or two he said, hesitatingly, â\\x80\\x98 Madame Sanson.does not think you more ill than usual?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No. There is nothing especially the matter; only I know that every day I become weaker. It is very strange that I should have told you all this,â\\x80\\x99 said Louis, with a smile at his new friend. â\\x80\\x98 It is much more strange that you should have kept this feel 172 ing to yourself, and that no one should have been able to find it out,â\\x80\\x99 Clement said warmly. â\\x80\\x98 But now you must let me take you in hand. I shall bring a doctor to see you to-morrow morn 172 ing. Hush! you must say nothing against it; it will be my affair, not yours. I must have something to employ myself about while I am waiting for Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny; and if we can set you up â\\x80\\x94who knows?â\\x80\\x94it will be worth staying longer for.â\\x80\\x99 Louis shook his head, but did not oppose him further; and Clement turned the conversation, talking on to the boy about England and English matters in a manner which, while it amused, did not fatigue him by calling for much reply. In the little he said, he was surprised to find thought beyond his years, and to discover that the books he had read, though few, were good of their kind. Clement was half provoked at the manner in which everything was referred to Ursule, against whom his prejudices deepened the more, as he charged her in his own mind with blindness and indifference to her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s condition.A NEW FRIENDSHIP. 119 The morrow came, and with it Mr. Blunt and the doctor. The latter was a man of few words: he asked certain questions, prescribed more nourishment than medicine, and said no more till Clement was alone with him in the street. Even then he showed his opinion more by a quick characteristic gesture than by anything else; but it was unmistakable, and Clement felt that Louisâ\\x80\\x99 words were confirmed. â\\x80\\x98 Is he so ill ? â\\x80\\x99 he asked, much shocked. â\\x80\\x98 There is nothingâ\\x80\\x94no constitution left.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No hope ?â\\x80\\x99 Monsieur Pelletier shrugged his shoulders again. 1 But not immediate danger ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Certainly not. It is not definite illness, but gradual sinking.â\\x80\\x99 Clement went back to Louis, dreading the questioning that he might have to undergo. He need not have feared : beyond a glance in his face when he entered, the boy asked nothing. He was perfectly patient and obedient, took what had been prescribed, and looked so animated and interested over some school reminiscences which Clement rubbed up for his benefit, that the latter began to persuade himself that the doctor was an old fool, and only gave up the case because he wanted the skill to treat with it. Day after day Mr. Blunt spent hours in Louisâ\\x80\\x99 room. He smiled to himself more than once at the unexpected attraction he had found in the old house at Dieppe, partly owing, no doubt, to the new pleasure of being looked and longed for as he never before had been in his life. Louis was thoroughly happy in his visits, rested on the older manâ\\x80\\x99s stronger character, admiring it even when it showed sternness; listened unweariedly to his thoughts and opinionsâ\\x80\\x94which Mr. Blunt found himself detailing with an openness which astonished himselfâ\\x80\\x94and in120 ONE YEAR. his turn expatiated upon Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s excellences, or hesitatingly ventured to ask questions upon problems which had never yet been solved. So the two lived on, perfectly contented with each other. Madame could not do enough to show her delight in the young Englishman who had thus opportunely come to cheer her boyâ\\x80\\x99s loneliness; for Pierre, although since Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s de 172 parture he had ventured once to go up and see his friend, was no longer dependable, and, indeed, between his misery and his satisfaction, which were now pretty well balanced in his heart, was not a very agreeable companion for any one. Clement was moved not merely by pity, but by real interest in the boyâ\\x80\\x99s cha 172 racter. It was, perhaps, too feminine and sensitive for healthy, manly work in the world; but this strain was never to be put upon it, and it\\' was most lovable in its purity and perfect gentleness. If the life had borne its struggleâ\\x80\\x94as what life does not?â\\x80\\x94it seemed to have left no scars to mark it, and, through all the weakness and suffering, there was an expression of unruffled peace upon the beautiful boyish face to be tracad even in his worst moments of pain. There was as yet no change in his habits. Clement some 172 times fancied that, at whatever cost to himself, he was bent upon no outward change being perceptible to Ursule when she re 172 turned. He still lay upon the little couch : when the day was very fine, he persuaded Clement to lift him into the balcony ; nay, he still continued to paint Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s little cherry-girl, which he had begun before she went away, although more than once dropping the brush from exhaustion. Her letters were his great delight, so full and tender that Mr. Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s unfair prejudices almost melted away before them, and describing every incident of their journey sufficiently at length for her brother to be madeA NEW FRIENDSHIP. 12 1 acquainted with the minutest particulars, while the very fidelity of her descriptions rendered them picturesque. They were as fresh as Ursule herself; for she had scarcely written a letter in her life before, and wrote as she spoke, with a good many faults of expression, but a bright charm of originality to compensate for them- In his answers Louis had been asked by Clement to desire Ursule to keep his coming unknown to Madame. Mr. Blunt and Louis were sitting together as usual one morn 172 ing. Not many words had passed between them, for each was taken up with thinking over letters received that day. Louisâ\\x80\\x99 was, of course, from Ursule, and was the last. That day she and Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny were to return; and he lay back with a look of calm rest upon his face, such as Clement remarked and en 172 vied. His own letter was from his mother, full of blame for remaining away so long a time, of indignation with her sister for her absence, and of a recapitulation of the inconvenience to herself in not having her son with her. It was written in French, the old familiar language which she liked to talk and write with him, and it contained one injunction :â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Who is this Mademoiselle Ursule Lafon, whom you mention as travelling with your aunt ? Find out.â\\x80\\x99 Clement read it, and would have asked a question or two to gain the information she required, but that, glancing up at the moment, he saw Louis looking so absorbed that he did not like to interrupt him, and went on with his letter instead. The inquiry did not seem to him of any great consequence, but Mrs. Blunt was peremptory, and would be sure to need an answer; he made up his mind, therefore, to ask Louis, by-and-by, for more particulars about his family. Clement felt that his visit was drawing to an end. The object of his journey was to induce Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny to join her122 ONE YEAR. sister in England, and from what he gathered from Louis and Madame Sanson he believed that there was little chance of suc 172 cess. Either way, he could not himself linger much longer, and the thought struck him with regret. His few days of quiet life had been very pleasant to him ; for to be with one so gentle and so single-minded as Louis was in itself a refreshment, and the sur 172 rounding atmosphere was a thorough change from that of his own home. It was hard to believe that his visit had been so short as was really the fact ; but now, if anything reconciled him to its being brought to a close, it was the prospect of Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s return. He felt as if it must put an end to the quiet, close intimacy into which, in spite of the disparity of years, Louis and he had fallen, and with a sigh he made up his mind that this present peaceful morning would be the last. Looking up at Louis to say something of the sort, he saw that he was asleep. It was not unusual, for his nights were disturbed, and short snatches of day-sleep frequently made his principal rest. Clement stole out of the room on tiptoe, having something to say to Madame. But he had not reached the bottom of the stairs before he became aware that something was seriously amiss in the little glass room. He hurried to the door, saw Monsieur standing with a fork in one hand and a saucepan in the other, the very picture of helpless bewilder 172 ment; and Madame, good-tempered, light-hearted Madame, actually crying as if her heart would break. As soon as she perceived Clement, her sobs redoubled. â\\x80\\x98Oh, Monsieur, such news, such terrible news! Jules, why do you not inform Monsieur, when you see it is beyond me?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Terrible news, Monsieur,â\\x80\\x99 repeated her husband, like an obedient parrot, waving his head and the saucepan at the same time.A NEW FRIENDSHIP. I2 3 â\\x80\\x98What has happened?â\\x80\\x99 But Madame only went into another fit of sobs, and Mr. Blunt began to fear that he would never receive any information, when she, suddenly checked herself, told Jules to put the things upon the stove, and then showed a little scrap of scrawled-upon paper which she had been all the while crumpling in her hand. â\\x80\\x98 Monsieur knows that Madame, his aunt, and Ursule were to return this day ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yesâ\\x80\\x94well ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 There has been a frightful accidentâ\\x80\\x94frightful ! â\\x80\\x99 repeated Madame, becoming excited again. â\\x80\\x98 An accident ! To the train ? \\' â\\x80\\x98To the train.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How do you know ? What have you heard ? Who is hurt ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Hurt, Monsieur ? They are all either hurt or killed. Oh, my poor dear child ! â\\x80\\x99 Clement turned pale, but he was lawyer enough to know that so sweeping an assertion contradicted itself. â\\x80\\x98 Impossible ! â\\x80\\x99 he exclaimed. â\\x80\\x98 Has that slip of paper anything to do with the matter. Pray let me know everything as quickly as possible. There is that poor boy to be thought of. Good Heavens, how terrible ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, is it not, Monsieur? And I just getting poor Madameâ\\x80\\x99s room ready for her ; and I persuaded her to go ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Let me see,â\\x80\\x99 repeated Clement, impatiently, holding out his hand for the paper. â\\x80\\x98 Why,â\\x80\\x99 he exclaimed, glancing rapidly over it, â\\x80\\x98 this is from Mademoiselle Lafon herself. She is not killed, at all events.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, Monsieur,â\\x80\\x99 returned Madame, a little indignantly; â\\x80\\x98but look at the writing, and judge what her condition must be.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, that is nothing,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Blunt, much relieved. â\\x80\\x98I dare124 ONE YEAR. say she was shaken enough. She says she is unhurt herself, and that she hardly knows as yet what injury my poor aunt has received. How did this come ? â\\x80\\x98Auguste Pasquier brought it here. He was one of the poor creatures in this horrible train.â\\x80\\x99 And, by little and little, it came out that the accident, what 172 ever it was, had occurred at no great distance from Dieppe, and that as soon as possible those who were comparatively unhurt had been forwarded to their destination. Ursule had seen a face she recognised among the frightened passengers, and had entreated him to take a few hastily scribbled lines to the San- sons, hoping by this means that a positive assurance of her safety would reach Louis before he had time to be alarmed. If she was, as she twice repeated, unhurt, she was evidently sorely shaken and confused, and could scarcely write coherently. Clementâ\\x80\\x99s first impulse was to hurry to the station; then he remembered that, in Louisâ\\x80\\x99 condition, it was scarcely prudent to leave the task of breaking the tidings to Madameâ\\x80\\x99s discretion, and he resolved to carry the note to him himself. Directly he saw him, he perceived that he must use great caution ; for Louisâ\\x80\\x99 eyes were fixed eagerly upon the door, as if a strange secret sympathy told him that something was wrong. Mr. Blunt at once put the note into his hands. â\\x80\\x98 This is from your sister herself/ he said ; â\\x80\\x98 it is to tell you that the train has been delayed, and that she is quite unhurt, although there has been a sort of accident.â\\x80\\x99 The boyâ\\x80\\x99s hand trembled so much that he could scarcely hold the paper. â\\x80\\x98 Poor Madame is injured ?â\\x80\\x99 he said, looking up with a horror- struck expression. â\\x80\\x98I fear so; but it may not be much. Of course, she isA NEW FRIENDSHIP. frightened. I am going at once, and shall bring them back as soon as possible.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Take care of Ursule,â\\x80\\x99 said Louis, faintly. â\\x80\\x98Take care of yourself, my boy; that is the best thing you can do for her.â\\x80\\x99 His heart smote him at having to leave him, but he felt he could not linger. He begged Madame to go up at once and cheer him ; and she, having rapidly recovered from the shock of her first impressions, was likely to prove a hopeful comforter.CHAPTER VIII. THE ACCIDENT.

George Withers. station was in a state of suppressed excitement, Mr. Blunt found it impossible to do more than Ã\\xad up atoms of information, often contradictory ; were too busy to answer questions, even from those most deeply interested in the sufferers, and the utmost they ever permitted themselves to say was to the effect that they hoped the accident was not so serious as had at first been feared. Eager white-faced inquirers crowded into the station as the tidings became more widely spread ; wives, mothers, children, huddled together crying and talking, waiting for the train which for the officialsTHE ACCIDENT. 127 was momentarily expected to bring in more of the victims, or for that which was to start immediately after its arrival for the scene of the disaster. A young husband, whose wife had been in the train, paced frantically up and down the platform ; porters hurried by the groups, whose misery they disliked encountering with nothing of comfort to offer; one or two doctors came quickly into the station, Louisâ\\x80\\x99 M. Pelletier among them. Presently the train came in, and a general rush was made to the spot. Clement stood on one side to let the women look eagerly into the carriages. Even to himself, the anxiety of the moment was sickening; what must it be to them? He touched the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s arm, and asked him to point out Ursule Lafon, if he saw her ; but it seemed almost a superfluous precaution, for he felt sure he should recognise her and Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny by instinct. A great white-capped fish-woman pushed past him, the basket on her back almost striking his face. She was searching for her husband, and Clement never forgot the look of agony in her eyes when she had convinced herself he was not there. Not very many passengers got out, and the greater number had received hurts of some kind, although in several cases these were but slight : almost all looked pale and scared, and scarcely able to respond to the joyful greetings which were lavished upon them. The young husband found his wife ; but when he poured out a torrent of rapturous delight, she burst into tears, as if the reaction were more than she could bear; and the doctors were obliged to interfere to prevent the shattered sufferers from being overwhelmed by the heart-rending questions and lamentations of those whose friends were still among the missing. Presently, and as soon as the excitement had a little subsided, it was found out that the train was going to start on its return128 ONE YEAR. journey to the scene of the accident. Clement jumped into a carriage where were a gendarme, a couple of men in blouses, M. Pelletier, and two or three women. As the train moved slowly off, even the most vehement grew quiet. Those next the windows stretched out their heads, as if already expecting to see traces of what had happened ; one of the womenâ\\x80\\x94the wife, as Clement afterwards discovered, of the stokerâ\\x80\\x94sat with her hands clasped, mute and rigid with terror ; another, recover 172 ing from the first awe, began to pour out prophecies and surmises to her neighbour. The sun was shining, the English- looking orchards and hedge-rows were steeped in the delicious quiet of a summer afternoon ; the women at work in the fields looked calmly up at the train as it dashed past them, uncon 172 scious of what had come to pass, not many miles away from their peaceful homes. Once the speed slackened ; the women shrank together. Clement looked inquiringly at M. Pelletier, who had been occupying himself with making notes in a pocket-book. He shook his head as he caught the Englishmanâ\\x80\\x99s eye. â\\x80\\x98 We have not gone the distance yet. Monsieur is interested in some one?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My aunt, I fear, is injured ; she is travelling with the young girl with whom Monsieur is acquaintedâ\\x80\\x94Mademoiselle Lafon.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 The doctor went back to his pocket-book; silence fell upon all, even upon the least affected. A few more miles of trees and fields, and windmills crowning the highest points, and the train slackened speed again, went slowly, more slowly, stopped. The gendarme and the doctor kept back the women, who were for pressing out. No one was allowed to descend until the guard came to give leave, nor could anything be seen from theTHE ACCIDENT. I2Ã\\x87 windows, crowded as they were with anxious faces. When at length they were released, they found there was still a little distance to walk before the spot was reached. A few set off running ; others hung back as if they could not face their fears. Clement pushed on with the doctor. They came upon the scene at last. The engine lying on its side, buried deep in the soft earth of the embankment, all the green grass blackened and scorched by the water from the boiler; the carriages, some standing erect and untouched, others pounded into a thousand pieces; great wheels sticking out of shattered planks ; rails torn up and bent, telegraph wires twisted round fragments of carriages. The doctor hurried on. â\\x80\\x98 Plenty of work for us here,â\\x80\\x99 he said to Clement. â\\x80\\x98 What an accident ! â\\x80\\x99 What an accident, indeed ! It was very simply explained afterwards : a little carelessness on the part of some workmen, and the train ran off the line. It had happened three hours before, and the greater part of those who were in the carriages had been removed to a farm-house fortunately near; some had not yet been extricated ; only one was known to be deadâ\\x80\\x94the stoker. One of the officials hurriedly told them this. Two medical men were at the farm-house, and he thought that monsieur le docteur would do well to stay and give assistance to the poor creatures who were yet to be got out. He showed them where the workmen were labouring at great masses of splintered fragments, and they hastened to the spot. One man was released just as they reached it : the doctor poured brandy down his throat, and superintended placing him on a rude kind of litter, which had already served to carry others to the house. The remaining sufferer was a woman whom the me i did not believe to be much crushed, although a large 9130 ONE YEAR. piece of machinery had fallen in such a manner as to render the task of extricating her extremely long and difficult. The instant Clement saw that a young girl was standing by her side with a face of the utmost distress, by turns encouraging her and imploring the workmen to be careful, he guessed who it was. The next moment, the doctor touched his arm, and said, â\\x80\\x98 Tenez, there is Mademoiselle Ursule ! â\\x80\\x99 This was no time for explanations; it is doubtful whether Ur 172 sule would have understood him had he attempted them, for she had eyes and ears only for one object. He could but aid her by joining the men, and, under the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s directions, working with all his might at the rescue. Poor Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny was not sensible throughout ; at times she appeared conscious of her situation, and then, with a groan, would close her eyes again : when at length she was released, and the men stood wiping the big drops from their foreheads, Ursule would have passionately embraced her; but the doctor put her aside, not unkindly, but with an air of prompt decision. â\\x80\\x98Perfect quiet, if you please, Mademoiselle! You will do best now by going as fast as you can to the farm, and seeing that all is ready by the time we arrive. Monsieur will remain here to assist.â\\x80\\x99 She had the good sense to be obedient, although the strain upon and shock to her nerves had been so great that she felt and moved like one in a dream. It was not until she was close upon the house that she became conscious that her dress was torn and slit in all directions, and that her whole body ached with a dull dead pain. The mistress of the farm, a kindly faced woman in a snowy high cap, ran out to meet her before she had crossed the yard, and kissed her in the hearty, tearful eagerness of her welcome.THE ACCIDENT. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, you poor child ! â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98 what must you not have gone through ! Come inâ\\x80\\x94come in ! Yes, I know all about it; have they got out the poor creature ?â\\x80\\x94there is a place waiting for her, and the best of doctors. Come, and let me see to your 172 self.â\\x80\\x99 But Ursule refused all assistance until she had seen Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny brought in and laid on a mattress, and had undressed her and heard M. Pelletierâ\\x80\\x99s report. She had escaped wonder 172 fully, in his opinion, as far as yet could be told; but he was not altogether sure that she had not received an injury of some sort to the back, and this, of however slight a description, became a serious matter when her age was taken into account. Restora 172 tives had entirely brought back conciousness; but she was in a painfully nervous and restless state, and for two or three hours Ursule could do nothing but attempt to soothe her, until M. Pelletier, coming in again to visit her, and a little girl of about twelve years old, who was the other occupant of the tiny room, administered some quieting medicine, and she fell into an un 172 broken sleep. Nurses had been telegraphed for, as well as doctors. One, in the dress of a Sister of Charity, came softly in to take Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s place; and the girl, exhausted herself, and longing to know more of the condition of her fellow-travellers, stole on tiptoe out of the room. The whitewashed, red-tiled farm was put to its utmost to meet these unexpected and sad demands upon its hospitality. Twelve persons had found refuge there, of whom at least eight were more or less seriously injured, and friends, doctors, and nurses added to the numbers. The good mistress and her three daughters worked unceasingly to supply all that was needed : no one could do enough to show their pity and sympathy. The132 ONE YEAR. kitchen, with its goodly ranks of shining dishes, had been hastily fitted up with beds and palliasses; the best linen dragged sweet and fresh out of the great press for the use of the suf 172 ferers. Rough men moved noiselessly about; a big, fierce-looking, bearded gendarme tenderly dandled a little child before its motherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, that she might assure herself of its safety. All the windows were set open ; the soft, pure air stole in, just stirring the blind; the sunlight fell in golden streaks upon the stained deal floor, and outside the cows were lowing impatiently because milking-time had come and passed. Jeanne, DorothÃ©e, and Louise, healthy, honest-looking girls, were greatly interested in Ursule, who was of about the same age as themselves. The state of her dress and her white face hor 172 rified them, and DorothÃ©e was at once for carrying her off to her own room and lending her some clothes. â\\x80\\x98Let me stay one moment,â\\x80\\x99 pleaded Ursule earnestly; â\\x80\\x98I want to know how they all are. Who is in this room ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98We cannot go in there,â\\x80\\x99 said DorothÃ©e, in a frightened whis 172 per, laying her hand upon the lock, lest Ursule should open the door; â\\x80\\x98 he is there, and the poor wife, too.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98He? Who?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The stokerâ\\x80\\x94the poor man who was killed.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 Ursule said no more, but suffered herself to be drawn away : she had not heard of this one death, and it shocked her inex 172 pressibly. She followed her guide through a long passage which led to another part of the house, when they were stopped by the motherâ\\x80\\x99s voice calling DorothÃ©e in imperative accents. â\\x80\\x98 How tiresome !â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, hurriedly. â\\x80\\x98 However, my mother will not keep me. Wait for me one moment. There, sit in this window-seat until I come back.â\\x80\\x99THE ACCIDENT. 133 Ursule sat down as she was told : she was so weary that she could not object to anything. She rested her arms upon the sill and looked out. The country was too level to be picturesque in form, but it possessed a smiling summer beauty of its ownâ\\x80\\x94un 172 dulating fields of corn just beginning to be touched with yellow ripeness, orchards nestling round the house, a glimmer of water in the distance, long shadows and rich ruddy sunset lights on earth and sky. It was all there, but she could see nothing of itâ\\x80\\x94nothing but the one scene that seemed to be branded upon her mind, and to grow more distinct every moment. She shut her eyesâ\\x80\\x94in vain : she saw only the more clearly that dreadful, shattered heap of splinters, and the faces of deadly terror sur 172 rounding her. She had never in\\' her life fainted, but she was very nearly doing so now, and only a determined effort pre 172 vented it. Suddenly some one addressed her. â\\x80\\x98 How is Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny ? â\\x80\\x99 said the voice. â\\x80\\x98 Asleep,â\\x80\\x99 answered Ursule, mechanically. * I am afraid that you are suffering yourself, Mademoiselle r â\\x80\\x98 Oh, that is nothing. At least,â\\x80\\x99 said she, standing up and pushing back her hair with both hands, â\\x80\\x98 one must suffer when one thinks of it.â\\x80\\x99 She fancied he was one of the doctors, Until, glancing up, it struck her with a dull wonder that she had seen his face before. Suddenly she exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98 Ah, now I remember ! Was it not you who were so good in helping us ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I had the best of reasons,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, smiling ; â\\x80\\x98I am Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s nephew.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Her nephew ! What ? are you the Monsieur Blunt of whom Louis writes ? Oh, Monsieur, then you have seen Louis ? â\\x80\\x98Yes, indeed, Mademoiselle; I have been sitting with him134 ONE YEAR. this morning. I was with him, indeed, when your little note was brought.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And was he frightened?â\\x80\\x94did he understand? Oh, Mon 172 sieur, why did you come away ?â\\x80\\x94I beg your pardon ; I forgot.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 He has your note, remember. And about his hearing to 172 night ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah, yes ; what can we do ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I will tell you. M. Pelletier returns to Dieppe this evening, and has promised to take charge of a message from you. Or, if you think you can write a few lines, it might be better. Here is a slip of paper,â\\x80\\x99 continued Clement, tearing a page out of a pocket-book. She thanked him gratefully, and managed with some difficulty to write a few words to repeat the assurance of her own safety. â\\x80\\x98M. Pelletier will see Louis himself,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Blunt, â\\x80\\x98and can explain the state of the case to him as no one else could do. But I am sure you ought to be taking rest yourself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98My mother says she must do so at once,â\\x80\\x99 said DorothÃ©e, who had just returned, looking anxiously at Ursule. â\\x80\\x98SÅ\\x93ur Monique is with the lady ; and if she leaves her, I or one of my sisters will go in and watch.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I must not be long away,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule absently. But she made no further resistance when DorothÃ©e put her arm in hers and drew her towards her room, and, indeed, her strength seemed to have all at once deserted her. She lay down on the only little bed left in the room, which had not been called into service below ; and her kind companion, hoping that she would soon sleep, placed a dress of her own close to the bed, drew the white window-blind to exclude the light, and went softly out. It was very quiet and peaceful in the little room, far re 172 moved from the painful bustle below stairs. Nothing reachedTHE ACCIDENT. I 35 Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s ear but the occasional sound of some of the farm animals and the monotonous hum of insects in the acacia tree outside the window. Yet she could not sleep. Her eye wan 172 dered backwards and forwards, from the homely scanty furniture to the gay little prints upon the walls, though afterwards she could not recollect their subjects in the least, so uncompre 172 hending had been her gaze. She had not lain down for more than a quarter of an hour, when she longed to get up again ; the stillness and quiet, instead of soothing, seemed to oppress her. She even tried to rise, but her limbs ached so wearily that she gave way, and stretched herself again upon the bed with a sigh. Nevertheless, although she was unable to sleep, by-and-bye the rest began to have a beneficial effect, the stupor-like feeling to pass off, and her ideas to detach themselves from that one fixed point round which they all revolved. She began to think not so much of the peril as of the escapeâ\\x80\\x94not so much of the sudden crash, and confusion, and horror, as of the Mercy which had protected her in the very jaws of death. Religion was to her such an impersonal thing, that what to others would have been an immediate and spontaneous thought came like a new sensation. She always believed that she ought to be â\\x80\\x98good,â\\x80\\x99 but it was the first time in all her life that a real glow of thank 172 ful childlike love went up from a full heart with the words of thankfulness she uttered. What would have become of Louis had she been killed? What would have become of herself? Ursule shuddered and hid her face in her hands, for there was the most dreadful thought. Like a lightning flash her life seemed to start out before her with all its shortcomings, its wasted hours, its carelessness, its impatience. What had she ever done to win her father back ? Nothing. She had treated136 ONE YEAR. him with angry contempt, which could but have the effect of making him more dislike his home. It was true that she was more angry for Louisâ\\x80\\x99 sake than her own ; but her newly stirred conscience asked itself whether a passionate love for Louis ought to swallow up her duty to her father, and there could be only one answer. How much had she done from a sense that it was right ? how much because it was pleasant ? How had she controlled her temper ?â\\x80\\x94was it by this time in better keep 172 ing than a year or two ago ? And nowâ\\x80\\x94if she had been cut off! It was not the first time that such questions had arisen in her mind. They are merciful messengers, sent often to knock at the door of our hearts ; and alas for us if the time ever arrive when they come no more ! But Ursule had never honestly answered them. She had put them aside, or satisfied herself with some half-formed resolution ; and now, when for the first time in her life she began to see herself as she was, when there flashed before her the first real idea of what life really is, of what our enemy is, of what the struggle, and the battle, and the race must beâ\\x80\\x94now even that faint picture must have over 172 whelmed her, if with it had not come the happy sense of grateful love, the thankfulness for a great deliverance, the belief that He, who in mercy had spared her, would forgive, and help, and strengthen. The light faded away out of the little room, a fresh breeze sprang up, the white window-blind flapped backwards and for 172 wards. Presently DorothÃ©e came, a candle in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other. â\\x80\\x98 Ah ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, looking at Ursule with satisfaction, and then kissing her, â\\x80\\x98 one can see by your face that you have had a good sleep.â\\x80\\x99THE ACCIDENT. 137 â\\x80\\x98I have not slept,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, cheerfully; â\\x80\\x98but I am quite rested. Only, do you know, you must be kind enough to pull me out of bed. My bones are so wonderfully stiff that I really donâ\\x80\\x99t think I can move in any other way.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But what ! Who ever heard of such a thing ! You are not to get up, I assure you. One of my sisters and I mean to take turns in sleeping on the floor ; but we shall not disturb you. Louise has been obliged to go out, and make the women see after the poor beasts : the stupid creatures could do nothing but crowd round the door and stare, or go off to that terrible place. There, how foolish I am ! â\\x80\\x99 she said, seeing Ursule change colour. â\\x80\\x98Jeanne told me to say nothing about it. Do not think of getting up. Madame is well cared for.â\\x80\\x99 But Ursule was so bent upon it that the good-natured DorothÃ©e could hold out a very little time against her. She dressed her in a stout gown of her own, and insisted upon doing everything for her, the consequence of which was a loud â\\x80\\x98 Ah ! â\\x80\\x99 which made Ursule look up and ask, with a smile, â\\x80\\x98 What is it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Your arm. It is blackâ\\x80\\x94it is dreadful to see !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is only a bruise ; it goes down my side. Think what it is to have escaped with no more than a bruise. Howâ\\x80\\x94how is that poor thing, the wife ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Jeanne said you were not to talk about it,â\\x80\\x99 said DorothÃ©e, doubtfully. â\\x80\\x98 Tell me,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, coaxingly. â\\x80\\x98 She is broken-hearted. She does not cry, but sits and looks at him without a word. None of us like to go in, it is so terrible to see. There, now you are one of us. Shall I lend you my fete-day cap ? The satin ribbons are quite new.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule declined the cap, in spite of this recommendation,138 ONE YEAR. and the two girls went down together to Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s room first, where SÅ\\x93ur Monique, with her sweet, placid face, was sitting by Madameâ\\x80\\x99s side, talking in a low, soothing tone. The child was sleeping; a tiny lamp burned on the table; everything was in exquisite order. DorothÃ©e stayed outside the door; at a sign from the Sister, Ursule went eagerly in. â\\x80\\x98 Ah, dear Madame ! â\\x80\\x99 she whispered, bending over her with tears in her eyes, â\\x80\\x98 are you better now ?â\\x80\\x94in less pain ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Pain, child ? If you had any perception, you would know that the pain is dreadful. You have been a long time in coming to inquire for me. Go away now. SÅ\\x93ur Monique interests me, and I do not wish for interruptions.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule drew back with a sigh. She said something in an under-tone to the Sister, who nodded her head after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s consideration. â\\x80\\x98 Go away, child,â\\x80\\x99 repeated Madame, imperiously. â\\x80\\x98 Dear Madame, in one moment,â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, gently. â\\x80\\x98 Do you know that a gentleman has come here to seek you from Dieppe ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 A gentleman ?â\\x80\\x94who then ? â\\x80\\x99 Madame mentally ran over the names of those whom she once had known. Had any of them actually sought her out now ? â\\x80\\x98 Quick, dÃ®tes donc, who ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 He says he is Mr. Blunt. He comes from England ; he is your nephew.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My nephewâ\\x80\\x94FÃ©licitÃ©â\\x80\\x99s son? Bah! it is impossible. Send him in at once, that I may see.â\\x80\\x99 Her voice was agitated, and SÅ\\x93ur Monique rose and bent over her. â\\x80\\x98You must not excite yourself,â\\x80\\x99 she said, in her calm, decided tone. â\\x80\\x98It will be better for you not to see him until to-morrow.â\\x80\\x99THE ACCIDENT. 139 â\\x80\\x98 You are right/ said Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, wearily putting her hand to her head. â\\x80\\x98 Ursule would have understood it also, if she had any consideration.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And you do not like me to stay/ said Ursule, reluctantly preparing to leave her. â\\x80\\x98 No, no, certainly ; I wish for no one but SÅ\\x93ur Monique. You only fatigue me.â\\x80\\x99 The kind Sister saw the girlâ\\x80\\x99s look of disappointment, and followed her to the door. â\\x80\\x98It is very common, this irritability/ she said in a low voice; â\\x80\\x98you need not think she means what she says. After such a shock, the whole system is in a highly nervous condition, and we doctors are not surprised at anything that the patient fancies.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am not surprised/ said Ursule, sadly ; â\\x80\\x98 because I know I often irritate her. Only â\\x80\\x99 She did not conclude her sen 172 tence, for she could not say that she had been hoping now to grow more patient and forbearing. â\\x80\\x98 Ah, to-morrow/ said the Sister, cheerfully, nodding kindly as she returned to her charge. â\\x80\\x98To-morrow? What is that Sister Monique says about to 172 morrow ? â\\x80\\x99 said the mistress of the farm, bustling up to them. â\\x80\\x98 I am sure it is as much as one can do to provide for to-night. I do not know what to do about that poor young wife. PÃ¨re Martin has been with her, and he left her, as he thought, com 172 forted ; but she is as bad as ever again now. I would stay with her if they did not want me in the kitchen. DorothÃ©e, can you not go in ? She ought not to be left alone, as she is.â\\x80\\x99 DorothÃ©e shrunk back. She was as kind-hearted a girl as could be found, but quite unfitted for such a task as that of comforting the young widow.140 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Well,â\\x80\\x99 said her mother, compassionating her fears, â\\x80\\x98 I must get Jeanne.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 May I try ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Ursule, timidly. Mother and daughter cried out at the idea ; but when she urged it intreatingly, it was really too welcome an offer to be refused. With a tremulous throbbing of her heart at the thought of the sorrow she was about to encounter, she followed the good woman to the door of the little room. It was ajar, and Madame Pichot was just going to push it open, when she held up her finger in token of silence. A manâ\\x80\\x99s voice was audible within, speaking very calmly and steadily. â\\x80\\x98 The saints preserve us,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame. â\\x80\\x98 It is the young Englishman. Look ! â\\x80\\x99 She held the door so that Ursule could look in. The wife had thrown herself upon the ground, by the bed on which her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s body was laid, burying her head in her hands. Clement stood with his back to the door, from time to time gently saying a few sentencesâ\\x80\\x94not his own, but the beautiful words of eternal promise, which generation after generation have comforted the mournerâ\\x80\\x99s heart. And Madame, listening intently for some minutes, turned round to Ursule and whis 172 pered, her own eyes wet with tears, â\\x80\\x98 She will do now, the poor child ! I can hear her crying.â\\x80\\x99 The women stole away, Ursule with a strong impression that Mr. Blunt must be â\\x80\\x98very good,â\\x80\\x99 but a second time disappointed in her hope to be of use. There was nothing now for it but obedience and a long nightâ\\x80\\x99s rest in the little far-away room ; and though hour after hour passed without sleep, it came at last in the early morning, and unquiet dreams of crashing trains melted away into unbroken and refreshing rest. The next day, things resumed their more natural course. AllTHE ACCIDENT. 141 the sufferers, except three, were sufficiently recovered to be removed to their homes. The mother of the little girl came to fetch her ; and such a happy chattering broke forth in Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s room as SÅ\\x93ur Moniqueâ\\x80\\x99s authority was powerless to check. Ursule and the girl stood upon tiptoe, and peeped in at the door to see the pretty meetingâ\\x80\\x94the childâ\\x80\\x99s burst of delight, and the motherâ\\x80\\x99s grateful look of intense relief. Even Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny grew interested, and wished them a gracious good-bye ; and quite a little triumphal procession escorted the doctor across the yard when he carried the little girl himself and placed her in the carriage. â\\x80\\x98 Bon jour,â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Bon jour] â\\x80\\x94 1 Au revoir !\\' â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 A . thousand thanks ! â\\x80\\x99 were called out while the carriage continued within hearing distance, and then handkerchiefs were waved until long after it had gone out of sight. â\\x80\\x98 I declare,â\\x80\\x99 cried Louise Pichot, twirling herself round, â\\x80\\x98 this affair has marvellously enlivened us, after all.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Louise, Louise ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, Jeanne,â\\x80\\x99 she said, penitently, â\\x80\\x98I know it was very dreadful. But you must own it is good to see such happiness as that ; and it is good to have Ursule.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It cannot be good to rejoice over anything that brings so much sadness,â\\x80\\x99 said Jeanne, resolutely. Louise looked unconvinced. â\\x80\\x98 Do you not think, Mademoiselle Jeanne,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, joining in the conversation, â\\x80\\x98 that the deeper our sympathy, the more readily it will answer to any call made upon it ? I mean,â\\x80\\x99 he continued, perceiving that he was not quite understood, * that your sister would have been as much wanting in kindness if she had refused to be glad over that motherâ\\x80\\x99s delight just now, as if she had felt no sorrow for the poor thing in yonder.â\\x80\\x99142 ONE YEAR. The grave Jeanne shook her head. â\\x80\\x98 I should not care for peopleâ\\x80\\x99s sorrow for me, if they forgot it directly,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98 And I would much rather they did as Monsieur says,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Louise, who seldom ventured to contradict her sister, but now tasted the delight of having a champion. â\\x80\\x98 I think that must be the best, because it is the hardest,â\\x80\\x99 put in Ursule, in a low voiceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 the hardest to practise always, I mean. Sometimes one feels more quickly with people in sorrow, and sometimes with those in joy; but it must be very difficult always to throw oneself into their case.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98SÅ\\x93ur Monique does that,â\\x80\\x99 said DorothÃ©e, pausing in her knitting. â\\x80\\x98Did you see how pleased and happy she looked when the little thing flung her arms round her neck ? And yet no one can feel more in trouble than she does.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Louisette,â\\x80\\x99 interrupted Jeanne, â\\x80\\x98what will our father say if the milk-cheeses are not ready for to-morrowâ\\x80\\x99s market ? Come, we must go into the dairy.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And I must go back to the house,â\\x80\\x99 said DorothÃ©e. â\\x80\\x98 Stay out a little longer, Ursule ; the orchard is pleasant at this time of dayâ\\x80\\x94the air will do you good.â\\x80\\x99 If Ursule expected Mr. Blunt to follow the three sisters into the sunny-looking old farm, framed in timber, like so many of the Nonnandy houses, she was mistaken. He turned with her towards the orchard, and was the first to speak. â\\x80\\x98 Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny is really better, you think ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I hope so,â\\x80\\x99 she said, brightly ; â\\x80\\x98 I believe she is recover 172 ing from the shock. It has been such a wonderful escape! Do you know,â\\x80\\x99 she continued, in a changed, awe-struck voice, â\\x80\\x98 that our compartment was really crushed to atoms ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Did you feel anything of what was coming ? But perhaps I ought not to ask you, or let you dwell upon it.â\\x80\\x99THE ACCIDENT. â\\x80\\x98 Everybody says that/ said she, with a touch of impatience ; â\\x80\\x98and, after all, it is worse to keep it to oneself always. No; I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I had time to feel more than just an instantaneous impression of something being wrong. I donâ\\x80\\x99t remember any 172 thing whatever before I found myself lying on a bank, wonder 172 ing how I came there, and what was going on all round me. The horror was when I looked up and could see nothing of Madame.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The marvel with such an accident is that so little mischief was done. I went this morning, very early, to examine into it a little more closely.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah?â\\x80\\x99 She looked at him with eager eyes of inquiry. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, the line is passable now, and the rails mended. But it will take some time to clear away the remains. When do you think my aunt will be ready to move ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Not for a day or two,â\\x80\\x99 she said, quickly ; â\\x80\\x98 certainly not.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Blunt looked at her with some surprise. He thought she would have been anxious to return to Louis ; and his hard thoughts of her carelessness for him returned. â\\x80\\x98 Your brother will be very much disappointed,â\\x80\\x99 he said, coldly. Her eyes filled with tears, but she kept her face determinedly turned away that he might not see them, quick enough to read his impression, and too proud to exculpate herself, by saying what was indeed the truthâ\\x80\\x94that as yet she could scarcely endure the thought of another journey. â\\x80\\x98 How did you think Louis was, Monsieur ? â\\x80\\x99 she asked at last, with some difficulty. â\\x80\\x98Very weak, certainly â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Did Madame Sanson think him more weak than usual ? â\\x80\\x99 she said, anxiously.144 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 She did not exactly say so.â\\x80\\x99 Clementâ\\x80\\x99s fixed idea was making him very pitiless. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Monsieur ! â\\x80\\x99 Ursule hesitated, stopped, and finally walked on again in the long soft grass. * Do you remain here long ? â\\x80\\x99 she said, abandoning her first intention. â\\x80\\x98 Only long enough to see my aunt home again. Do you think I could persuade her to go to England? My mother wants to have her there. You shake your head : you do not believe she would consent ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is such a journey ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, we shall see; I shall not give up easily.â\\x80\\x99 Shyly glancing at Mr. Blunt, she thought it probable that anything on which he set his mind would be carried out. She was sorry he had taken a prejudice against her, because she was inclined to be grateful for his kindness to Louis ; but while at any former time she might have resented it, the events of the last twenty-four hours had softened and humbled her; and she only smiled to herself with a glad security in the mutual love which could be so misread. Still it gave her an uncomfortable feeling in her companion 172 ship, and she was not long in making an excuse for returning to the farm, through the untidy yard, where a great strongly-built Normandy horse was being saddled to convey brisk dapper little Monsieur Pichot to the house of a newly-married son, who lived some kilomÃ¨tres away. The girls in the dairy called to her to come and help them ; and after she had ascertained that Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny wanted nothing, she joined Jeanne and Louise in their pleasant occu 172 pation of pressing the rich thickened cream into moulds, to be left to turn sour and then ripen. All that day and the next Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny was imperativeTHE ACCIDENT. MS in her desire to have her nephew with her whenever she was able to bear any person in the room, while Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s attendance she as imperatively declined. There was the charm of novelty about Clement ; he was not to be had any day ; it was not un 172 natural that she should cling to his presence. She lavished kind words upon him, and made him sit where she could watch every movement. She was jealous of Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s so much as being in the room ; and the girl bore her fancies with a patience and gentleness quite new to her. But Clement, seeing only the outside, concluded that she avoided the sick-room from selfish motives : he pitied from his heart his poor desolate aunt, who grasped so eagerly at his affection that he could not believe she would set aside any within her reach. He determined that Ursule only sought her own pleasureâ\\x80\\x94that she had left Louis selfishly, for the sake of this expedition, and that she now avoided her kind protectress in order to amuse herself with the girls of the farm. It was a harsh judgment ; but which of us has not suffered for our harsh judgments ? Three days passedâ\\x80\\x94four days. Ursule wrote to Louis daily, long letters full of love, and bright with descriptions of all that went on at the farmâ\\x80\\x94the butter-making and the bread-making, and Blanchette the calf, that knew her and came to eat out of her handâ\\x80\\x94the fresh pastoral life, so new to herâ\\x80\\x94the dewy mornings, the calm evenings, the kindly peopleâ\\x80\\x94concluding every account with, â\\x80\\x98 If only you were here ! â\\x80\\x99 Clement would have melted towards her, had he seen those letters. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny to all appearances grew better. She sat up in her bed, moved to a chair, and, by-and-bye, came into the kitchen. At times, it is true, she was especially nervous and irritable, and she complained, not infrequently, of her back ; but she had set 10146 ONE YEAR. her heart upon returning to Dieppe at the end of a week, and when the time came there was nothing, apparently, to prevent her. She was the last of the sufferers, and, as Louise said, they would feel quite desolate without any one todnurse. â\\x80\\x98Dear Ursule,â\\x80\\x99 said DorothÃ©e, sadly, when they were all waiting at the door for the light covered cart which was to take them to the station, two miles off, â\\x80\\x98 do not forget us.â\\x80\\x99 The girlâ\\x80\\x99s answer was a kiss. â\\x80\\x98 You tremble soâ\\x80\\x94are you ill ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And she looks like a sheet,â\\x80\\x99 put in Louise; â\\x80\\x98worse than when she came ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is nothing,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, determined to conceal her fears. â\\x80\\x98 Come to see us some day.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ursule ! â\\x80\\x99 called Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny ; and, hurrying through her leave-taking, she ran out and seated herself in the cart be 172 hind Clement and Monsieur Pichot, who had insisted upon driving them to the station himself.CHAPTER IX. REST. Who is the angel that cometh ? Death \\' Adelaide Proctor. |ND x tell thee, man of half an idea,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame famish them ! When I went to the station, and saw her white face looking out of the carriage, I could have cried. Madame is not so bad to see, considering what she has gone through ; but Ursule ! â\\x80\\x99 Madame need not have been so much alarmed, for it was rather suppressed terror at finding herself again in a railway train than any more serious ailment which affected the girl. It required all the self-command she could muster to keep herself from screaming many times on the journey, and, by the time they reached the station, she was sitting motionless and rigid, a very different person, as Clement remarked to himself, than when she was among her bright companions of the farm. No 172 body knew what she suffered, as she did not complain ; and when Madame Sanson petted and pitied her with a warm 10â\\x80\\x94214s ONE YEAR. motherly welcome, and she scarcely answered, he made up his mind more strongly than ever that she was selfish and spoilt, and vexed to return to her quiet home. The meeting between the brother and sister he did not see. He and Madame Sansonhelped his auntupthe old staircase, while Ursule came slowly behind, and passed on to the higher story. Louis was watching for her, and, with a cry of delight, she ran to his side, threw her arms round him, and burst into tears. She had not given way before; but now it seemed as if the terror and excitement must find a vent, and, struggle as she might, she could not regain her self-command. By-and-bye, however, Louisâ\\x80\\x99 caressing touch, as he smoothed her hair, began to exercise its old power, her sobs grew less frequent, her trembling ceased, and at last she looked into his face with a smile. Something she saw there made her start. â\\x80\\x98 Louis, have you been worse ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Do you suppose dreaming over railway accidents to be a wholesome proceeding ? â\\x80\\x99 said he playfully. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I cannot bear to think of what you must have gone through. Surely you are thinner? Have you had all you wanted ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98All, and a great deal more. I began to have fears that, if you did not soon come home, Madame would tie me up in cotton wool to preserve me. Her kindness has been wonder 172 ful ; Monsieurâ\\x80\\x99s, too. Think of his coming up here, the other day, and bringing me an offering of cider.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Cider ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You need not be alarmed. I had great work to reach that drawer, but there you will find the bottle safely deposited. One had not the heart to tell him that cider was not exactly invalidâ\\x80\\x99s drink.â\\x80\\x99REST. 149 Ursule was looking attentively at her brother. There was a change in his face ; it was more transparent, more spiritual- looking, in spite of the flush which the delight of her return had called up. But no shadow of the truth crossed her mind ; she thought only that he had suffered from anxiety, and would need tender care. Even when, later in the day, he mentioned casually Mr. Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s kindness in bringing M. Pelletier to see him, she did not take alarm. It was perfectly natural to her that every one who saw Louis should be interested in him; equally natural that those who did not know his complaint should believe in a doctorâ\\x80\\x99s power to do good. She felt ex 172 ceedingly grateful to Mr. Blunt, but not in the least conscious that Louis was more ill than usual. It was a delightful relief to her to sit in her old place by his side, and to pour out all the experiences of the past few days, chattering freely and unreservedly about whatever came upper 172 most. Always accustomed to share her thoughts with him, she told him what she felt the evening after the accident, as she lay in DorothÃ©eâ\\x80\\x99s little white bed. Louis listened thankfully. It seemed as if the deliverance had opened her heart, and by that means reached her reason and her will. What she said was very simple, but it showed a juster, because a deeper, conception of her own faults than she had ever before displayed, while her perfectly truthful nature guarded her against the least exaggera 172 tion of expression. It became a grave, eager talk at lastâ\\x80\\x94she listening with admiring love to Louisâ\\x80\\x99 remarks, full of the beauty of holiness, and he speaking more freely on the subject closest to his heart than he had ever done in the days when love for him made her chief, almost her only reason for caring to listen. Yet he longed, more than ever, that some one else could be found to help his sister ; he felt his own incapacity strongly. He didi5Â° ONE YEAR. not know that for years he had, indeed, been rendering her the best help in the example of his lifeâ\\x80\\x94an example which had long been secretly working, and would produce its fruit in Godâ\\x80\\x99s good time. When Clement came up-stairs and interrupted the conversa 172 tion, Ursule slipped out of the room and ran down to Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny. She found her irritably contrasting her apartment with that which she had enjoyed at Rouen; she was certain that it had been grossly neglected during her absence, and threatened Ursule with a withdrawal of herself altogether from the house. * That my nephew should see me here ! â\\x80\\x99 was the general tenor of her complaint; and it was not easy to meet it. Ursule bore, with very tolerable patience, a great deal of provocation; but she began to wonder whether this access of irritability had anything to do with the accident, and to wish that, while she had the opportunity, she had asked SÅ\\x93ur Monique a few more ques 172 tions. Mr. Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s presence invariably calmed her; but when he was not in the room she gave way to excited reproaches and lamentations. And Clement himself felt that, in a day or two at latest, he must return to his mother. He was heartily sorry to leave his aunt in her dreary solitariness, and he tried with every persua 172 sion in his power to induce her to promise to come to England. She listened and longed, but shook her head : the strange coun 172 try, the journey, the change in her habits, were too formidable obstacles to be at once surmounted. Still she thought she would go some day ; she even hesitated as to fixing a date for it, and Clement at times almost believed he had succeeded in his per 172 suasions, when some fresh motive for irresolution presented itself. He spoke to Madame Sanson about the possibility of giving his aunt some extra comforts, and found her unconscious that any-REST. thing was needed: had she not Ursule?â\\x80\\x94an argument which did not greatly impress him. â\\x80\\x98 Surely, Madame, a girl might be hired to come daily and do all that is needed for her room.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Monsieur is an admirable young man5 but no one could do that better for Madame than Ursule. Those girls, I know them ! Ah-h-h ! â\\x80\\x99 Nor in speaking to his aunt did he find much more satisfac 172 tion. She was proud, and unwilling that he should suppose her not duly waited upon. She assured him that, without the neces 172 sary work for her, Madame Sansonâ\\x80\\x99s days would be passed in absolute idleness ; and, in truth, Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny would have been sorry to exchange Ursule, with all her varying moods, for the most promising fille in Dieppe, who was no better than a servant, and could but have supplied a servantâ\\x80\\x99s place. Clement could do no more than procure one or two small articles of furniture of which he saw she was chiefly in need, and press her directly she felt equal to the move to join his mother in Eng 172 land, engaging at any time to come and fetch her himself. At those times when he went to sit with Louis, Ursule always left the room. Her doing so was partly owing to Madameâ\\x80\\x99s speech to her about Pierre RenaÃ®t, and partly from the feeling that Mr. Blunt judged her severely, not unjustly; for she was too single-minded to blame and yet excuse herself. When she acknowledged that her life had been self-pleasing and self-willed, she did not try to soften away the judgment; she set it honestly before her eyes, and determined, with Godâ\\x80\\x99s grace, to strive against its so continuing. As yet she scarcely realized the difficulties that would beset her. An escape such as hers had been was likely to impress the most thoughtless. It had brought death before her in its most sudden and awful form ; the effectI 5 2 ONE YEAR. must continue for some time, and gratitude seemed to make all her efforts easy. She wanted some one to warn her that this exaltation of feeling, this vivid appreciation of mercy, would pass away, and that she would need all the strength she could obtain to lead her onwards through the path of little, wearisome duties, of daily self-sacrificing efforts, of failures, of falls, of despondency. But she would as soon have thought of apply 172 ing to the Maire as to the pastor of the little French congrega 172 tion for help. He was a good, kindly man, unaccustomed to private ministrations or more personal influence with the members of his flock than he gained by his prÃªche in the â\\x80\\x98Temple.â\\x80\\x99 The very idea never crossed her mind, although Louis, less well acquainted with M. Laroche, had several times reflected on its possibility. Ursule, as I have said, generally left the room when Mr. Blunt paid his daily visits to her brother ; but, on what she knew would be his last, Louis had beforehand asked her so imploringly to remain that she could not refuse. She withdrew, however, to the window, and sat there upon a low stool, gazing into the street, as if she had found something exceedingly in 172 teresting, and taking no part in the conversation. She heard it, nevertheless, and she listened with a good deal of attention. Clementâ\\x80\\x99s manner was never so kind and gentle as with the sick boy; but she remarked that he did not so much as allude to the possibility of his becoming stronger, and a pang went through her, when this struck her, as if some unacknowledged haunting fear had suddenly taken form. He spoke of his own return, of the chance of Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s resolving to go to England; and when Louis only answered with his quiet smile, Clement said, â\\x80\\x98 Meanwhile, I want a remembrance.â\\x80\\x99REST 153 â\\x80\\x98Anything that we have, Monsieur,â\\x80\\x99 said the boy, eagerly; â\\x80\\x98 but that is so little.â\\x80\\x99 He drew out the little cherry-girl, and looked at her regret 172 fully. If it had been more advanced, here was the very thing ; but, alas ! his dreams of fortune had not been fulfilled ; he rarely now had strength to use the brushes; the design was scarcely sketched. â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, kindly; â\\x80\\x98you will like to try to finish that. But what about your fatherâ\\x80\\x99s pictures? Is their price beyond my reach ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I wish â\\x80\\x99 began Louis. Then he stopped, confused, not daring to bestow one upon Clement, as he would have rejoiced to do. â\\x80\\x98Which of them do you like best?â\\x80\\x99 he asked. â\\x80\\x98 That sea-piece, with the storm gathering. It haunts me. It is the most suggestive picture I have ever seen.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ursule, can you bring it here ? â\\x80\\x99 She rose at once. It was so favourite a picture of her own that she scarcely liked to part with it ; but since Clement had been kind to Louis, he was welcome to anything. The price was affixed to it, and was sufficiently moderate for the young Englishman to indulge what at the same time he considered to be an act of charity. As Ursule stood there holding it in a good light, her eye sought Louisâ\\x80\\x99 face. The fear which had suddenly shaped itself in her heart gave her an expression of intense yearning love startling to Clement when he caught it ; it was something so much deeper than he had credited her with. He began to think he had misjudged her, and to form a half-wish that he had more opportunities left of proving whether or no this was the case. But it was now too late. He bought the picture, wished Louis good-bye with an English 172 manâ\\x80\\x99s horror of anything approaching to a display of emotion.*54 ONE YEAR. and was a little vexed at Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s reserved bow ; running down 172 stairs to spend his last moments with his aunt, and to be accom 172 panied on his departure from the house by a whole volley of affectionate farewells from Madame, and a grunt from Monsieur, which, as his mouth was full of green peas, was the greatest effort of which he was capable, and possessed at least the merit of ambiguity. The house seemed rather cheerless without him, it must be confessed. The events of the last few weeks had made a break in the quiet lives of its occupants, and Clementâ\\x80\\x99s departure left them in their old position, yet with a difference. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny bewailed herself as the one most to be pitied ; but Louis also had lost a great deal in losing him, the only person who knew his secret, and could talk quietly on the subject; while to Ursule a change had come over her life, but with it a fear which would not be put aside. As the days went on, Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny claimed her atten 172 tion more and more. She could scarcely endure to spend so much time with her as obliged her to leave Louis for hours in the day ; yet she had found out that nothing distressed him so much as for her to refuse to sit with Madame when she desired it. Nor did he appear actually worse. She persuaded herself that it was the excessive heat that came on at this time which made him weaker ; when cool weather returned again, he would regain his lost strength. She persuaded herself, and yet watched so anxiously that she grew half angry with herself, and kept her anxiety from Louis as carefully as if to hint at it would be to confirm it. Meanwhile, beyond a doubt, the accident had affected Madame more than was at first suspected: she could not go out, complained of constant pain in her back, and was a hundred times more irritable than ever she had been before.EEST. *55 If poor M. Sanson had heard half the complaints she uttered against his imaginary stews, even his appetite must have suffered. Madame Sanson used to descend from one of her interviews with her lodger, and exclaim, holding up her hands, * She is getting beyond everythingâ\\x80\\x94that woman ! One would suppose that she was mistress, and I the dirt under her feet. This must not be, and that must not be. It is as difficult to coax her into good humour as to light a stove with wet sticks. Well, after all, it is worse for her than for me; and for the rest, what will you have?â\\x80\\x94the wind that blows from the north is cold, and always will be.â\\x80\\x99 Madameâ\\x80\\x99s conversations with her husband were of a one 172 sided nature, for he rarely did more than nod his large head or give an additional whiff to his pipe by way of answer, she meanwhile attaching to each manoeuvre the meaning that pleased her, and replying to it as if it contained a suggestion. * Ursuleâ\\x80\\x94did you ask? To say the truth, my heart aches for the poor child, and I feel quite sad about her. I canâ\\x80\\x99t help be 172 lieving that she, too, is becoming an angel. She used to have her little furies and her naughtinesses, but now, if she is out with anything of the sort, she looks ready to cry or to bite off her tongue ! I hardly know her ; I cannot think she is the same.â\\x80\\x99 What Madame thought of Louis, Ursule could not under 172 stand. She said very little about him, but her motherly atten 172 tions were redoubled ; and when Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny refused any society but the girlâ\\x80\\x99s, Madame used to toil up to the top of the house and coax Louis to eat, or gossip to him about Pierre Renaitâ\\x80\\x99s approaching marriage and the wonderful corbeille of his bride. Time passed. One day Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny called Ursule to return as she was leaving the room.150 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 By-the-bye,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98 I have had another letter from my nephew to-day, in which he repeats a question of my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s, to which I attached so little importance that it escaped my memory. FÃ©licitÃ© was always a little strange ; when once she had made up her mind, nothing would turn her. I remember when we were children togetherâ\\x80\\x94well, the years go on, and it is some little time ago nowâ\\x80\\x94there was to be a great Pardon held, not so many kilomÃ¨tres away from where we lived. My father and mother were going, as was the custom, and FÃ©licitÃ© was wild to go also ; but my mother would not hear of it. She said we children were better at home, and she should be frightened to death if she fancied us crushed in the crowd round the bonfire, and very likely getting scalded with the water out of the big cauldron ; for the children always would press in to throw their bits of stick. They would have taken us to see the saint in her beautiful bridal dress, and sent us home afterwards with the bonne, and that was all I cared about ; but FÃ©licitÃ© said that was nothing, and she would not go, so I had to stay at home as well. â\\x80\\x98 She looked so determined all the day, after my father and mother and my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s sister had started, with old Jean riding behind them, carrying a great bundle of flax for the saint, that I could not tell what she was thinking about, and she never liked me to ask her questions. We went to bed earlier than usual, by her wish, and I fell asleep, and slept as one slept in those daysâ\\x80\\x94all through the night; so figure to yourself my astonishment when, the next morning, I looked round to say something to FÃ©licitÃ©, and found she was not there! Our bonne, Toinette, was more frightened than I was when she came in, and when they had hunted everywhere and could not find her. For my part, I had a strong idea where she had gone ; but I daredREST. x 57 not breathe a word of it, for I knew that FÃ©licitÃ© would beat me when she came back, if she thought I had told anything. â\\x80\\x98Nobody knew what to do. Toinette was afraid of sending after my father and mother, lest they should blame her for want of diligence. As for me, I went about singing, because I was sure I should hear all about the Pardon and the bonfire, and then they scolded me for not caring about FÃ©licitÃ©. Quite late that night, she was brought home by a young Kloerâ\\x80\\x94a singing clerkâ\\x80\\x94and hard work he had to carry her. She fought, and scratched, and pulled his long hair with all her might, directly she found out where he was taking her. But fancy her bold 172 ness ! Little thing as she was, she had got out of the window directly she knew I was asleep, and went along the road by herself when it was nearly dark, and I should have expected at every step to meet the Buguel Nos, till she came to the plain and the bonfire, and there she played about with the other children, and at last crept under a tent, where were a number of people and children, and fell asleep. But she did not care about the next day at all ; she said there was too much preach 172 ing, and they sang nothing but prayers. Still, it must have been pretty to see all the processions coming in, with their flags and their offerings, and falling down on their knees. There were so many families mixed up with one another, that FÃ©licitÃ© got plenty to eat ; but, at last, some good woman thought there was something wrong, and she persuaded the young Kloer to find out from her where she lived, and to pretend to take her to another part of the plain. Oh, how angry she was ! She had wanted to see the fair the next day, and instead of that Toinette kept her in bed the whole time until my father and mother came home.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And that was Madame Blunt ! â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, aghast.ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, smiling to herself at the remembrance, and softened by the crowd of old memories which were throng 172 ing after it. â\\x80\\x98 That was FÃ©licitÃ© exactly. You have never seen a Pardon, child ? Besides, from what I hear, it is all altered now, and not worth attending.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My mother was a Breton,â\\x80\\x99 answered Ursule, * and often told me of them, and the sailors trooping up from the shore.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah ! your mother ! That was what FÃ©licitÃ© desired to know. Where does your family come from, and your nameâ\\x80\\x94-your name of Ursule ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It was my grandmotherâ\\x80\\x99s,â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, with a little wonder â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 Ursule Laget she was called. She lived at Nantes.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ursule Laget, of Nantes ! And your mother was â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Marie.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Child, are you sure ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But yes, Madame ! It would be hard if one did not know so much.â\\x80\\x99 She looked with some astonishment at Madame, who was strangely excited, but said nothing, beyond repeating to herself over and over again in a whisper, â\\x80\\x98 The child of the Lagets, at Nantes!â\\x80\\x99 Presently she said, â\\x80\\x98You may go now, child ; I must write,â\\x80\\x99 and then did what she had never done before in all her lifeâ\\x80\\x94drew the girl down and kissed her fore 172 head. Ursule ran up-stairs, full of wonder, to repeat the strange event to Louis, and to relate in full the history of this naughty FÃ©licitÃ©, who was mother to no less a personage than Mr. Blunt. It was one of those days when Louis was unusually well, sat up for a longer time, planned designs for his painting, and liked Ursule to chatter of all that passed through her head. But on the following morning he was worse than she had ever seen himâ\\x80\\x94breathless, speechless, and unable to move from his bed. She called Madame in an agony of terror, and when sheEE S T. saw her only shake her head and look distressed, with a gesture of dumb despair, she ran doâ\\x84¢ the stairs and out into the street to fetch M. Pelletier. He came, saw Louis, prescribed for him, and tried to leave the house without speaking to Ursule. He need not have been afraid ; she dared not ask him any questions, or face her fears. Only she would not leave her brother. When Madame Sanson climbed the stairs to deliver Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s imperative message for her to descend, Ursule shook her head, and Madame went slowly down again, unable to press the request. â\\x80\\x98 The heat is trying you, dear,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, for the twentieth time : â\\x80\\x98 you will be better when the evening comes.â\\x80\\x99 She got up quickly, and crossed the room. Louisâ\\x80\\x99 eyes were fastened upon her with so peculiar an expression that she could not meet them. * My darling,â\\x80\\x99 his voice was very low and calm, â\\x80\\x98 would it not be better to face it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Face itâ\\x80\\x94what? â\\x80\\x99 She turned sharply round with a ring of anguish in her voice. â\\x80\\x98 The knowledge you are trying to shut out.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I do not understand,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, trembling. 1 Do you not? Do you not really know that we shall not be together much longer ? â\\x80\\x99 She cried out passionately, â\\x80\\x98No, no ! â\\x80\\x99 then meeting his eyes, flung herself down by the side of his couch, and buried her face in her hands. â\\x80\\x98 M. Pelletierâ\\x80\\x99s medicine will do you good,â\\x80\\x99 she murmured. â\\x80\\x98 No medicine will do me good, dear. M. Pelletier knows that as well as I do. I have tried to spare you by not telling you before, but it might have been better to have concealed nothing.â\\x80\\x99i6o ONE YEAR. His old trick of smoothing her hair was quieting her even now ; but his exceeding weakness made speech difficult. â\\x80\\x98 Why should we not talk it over like any other change ? â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98 There is nothing really terrible.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 For you â\\x80\\x99 she said, in a choked voice. â\\x80\\x98 Nor for you. Darling, it is but for a little while.â\\x80\\x99 She shook her head. That little while seemed to her to stretch through such a long vista of years ! Nevertheless, Louis believed that, when the first force of the shock was past, there was comfort in the perfect confidence of old days, which she had shrunk from inviting while she was haunted by an unacknowledged fear. He tried to prevent her from shutting out any longer the thought of his death, and to. accustom her to speak of it calmly. Whatever moments of dread came over his own spiritâ\\x80\\x94and who can descend into the shadows of that awful valley, and not be oppressed with some fearfulness at its unknown depths ?â\\x80\\x94he hid from Ursule, speaking to her only of those brighter times of comfort when hope seemed almost to have attained its fruition. Meanwhile Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, really suffering herself, was feeling exceedingly injured at Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s desertion. All that Madame Sanson could say was in vain; and one day when the girl ran down for a moment at the express desire of her old friend, she overwhelmed her with a torrent of bitter reproaches. * Louis is very ill,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, with tears in her eyes, unheed 172 ing the reproaches. â\\x80\\x98 That is an absurdity.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Absurdity, Madame!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You and he make so much of his illness.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How dare you say so ! â\\x80\\x99 cried the girl, indignantly, â\\x80\\x98 how dare you say so ! He who gives up everythingâ\\x80\\x94he who thinksREST. i6i of you when you never think of himâ\\x80\\x94he make much of his suffering ! â\\x80\\x99 If words and looks could wither up, Madame must have shrunk to nothing. Ursule would have said more, but by a great effort restrained herself, and hurried out of the room. Madame felt at last that she had gone too far. Ursule had been so much more gentle of late that she had taken advantage of the change, and tyrannised over her as she would not have done in past days. But this insinuation against Louis had been too much. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny began to wonder whether he were indeed seriously ill; she scarcely ever so much as asked for him; she was almost angry when Ursule alluded to his suffering, feel 172 ing it a grievance that any one besides herself in the house should meet with sympathy. Now she was a little ashamed of herself, and a good deal alarmed lest she should have altogether offended Ursule. However, in the evening the girl came down, very subdued and sad, but no longer angry. It was, of course, Louis who had persuaded her to do so, all his old dread of anything approaching to strife quickened and increased by his present condition ; and it was to satisfy him that his sister agreed to deprive herself of those moments which were doubly precious now. For each day the change was but to more utter weakness. Power after power seemed to ebb away, while the inward light brightened. It grieved him so evidently to see Ursule shrink from speaking of what must come, that for his sake she nerved herself to talk calmly on the subject; and it was almost a surprise to her at first that, thinking of and caring for her as he did, there should be so little anxiety about her future in what he said, until she realised that the calm peacefulnessâ\\x80\\x94 more than submissionâ\\x80\\x94of his spirit did not permit him so 11IÃ\\x932 ONE YEAR. much as to doubt that all was and would be well That trust 172 fulness, like a little childâ\\x80\\x99s, was the best lesson that her less chastened heart could have received. Louis had a longing to see his father again, but no one knew where to send to find him. It was many weeks since he had been at home; and his last letter, written from Bruges, spoke of his going on through the old Belgian towns to seek subjects for his pencil. Madame, who had regal notions on the subject of the Post Office, and believed that to post a letter was to make sure that it would be received, somehow or other, wrote one to Bruges, although it was tolerably certain that he had long ago left the town. No answer cameâ\\x80\\x94indeed, Ursule had not dared to expect one; but she felt their desolate position more bitterly than ever. Yet it was not until Louis himself suggested it that she asked the French pastor to see him, nor until his visit was over, and Louis lay with a look of gladness on his face, that she realised the joy to him of the promise of the morrow. The morrow came, and with it intense weakness; but he would not hear of putting off, and, indeed, after her first word, she dared not press it. And while for herself she never forgot the comfort of that morning, to him it seemed to have brought not only strength of soul, but a partial return of bodily powers. He spoke less feebly, and smiled like his old self when one of Monsieur Sansonâ\\x80\\x99s characteristic messages was given him. â\\x80\\x98 Good Monsieur and Madame ! They will always be kind to you, Ursule.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Always, dear.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I should like to see him again. Ask him to come up to 172 morrow.â\\x80\\x99 But Monsieur Sanson was never asked. That night broughtlÃ¯EST. a change, and stupor and wandering came on. They could not be sure whether at times some slight consciousness did not return, but, if so, it was confused and clouded. The sinking was gradual and painless, like that which often accompanies extreme old age. Ursule, tearless, stood by, feeling and endur 172 ing the utter Tielplessness which comes over the bystanders at sight of that dread, irresistible approach, and too much absorbed in him to have thought for her own part in the separation. Nay, she had strength at intervals to repeat, with an unfaltering voice, the words she had heard the pastor use the day before, and had marked in her Bible. Madame sobbed loudly; Ursule only watched Louisâ\\x80\\x94watched till there stole over his face that awful shadow which comes but onceâ\\x80\\x94watched till over the shadow there fell also a stillness, and, without a sign or word, she knew that the life in which her own seemed to be bound up had passed away beyond her reach.CHAPTER X. â\\x80\\x98ADIEU DONC, BELLE FRANCE.â\\x80\\x99 But think nae ye my heart was sair, When I laid the mould on his yellow hair? Think nae ye my heart was wae, When I turnâ\\x80\\x99d about, away to gae ? Lament of the Border Widow. HE following day was too full of sharp anguish to be called unreal, and yet Ursule often felt as if she was living in a dream. Paroxysms of violent sorrow were succeeded by hours in which the sorrow was only not violent, because it was stupefied. That which soothed her most effectually was the sight of his face, on which the look of everlasting peace was stamped; and while this was left to her she did not feel utterly lonely. It was on the afternoon of the funeral that Madame feared most for her. She had attended it with a quietness that was unnatural, had seen the coffin descend, heard the pastorâ\\x80\\x99s voice proclaim the end of the earthly life, and had walked home, tearless still, and rigid ; but when she stood in the midst of their little room, and saw his empty couch, the self-control gave way, and she burst into a passion of tears, more heart-rending than any she had yet goneâ\\x80\\x98 ADIEU DONC, BELLE FRANCE: 165 through. It lasted long enough really to frighten Madame, who, looking round for consolation, caught up Louisâ\\x80\\x99 little brown Bible and pushed it into her hands. It seemed to Ursule like a treasure sent from him ; she pressed it to her heart, and kissed it vehemently, and afterwards she consented to let Madame undress and lay her, exhausted as she was, upon her bed. The sun streamed in at the Open window, and with it came a re 172 membrance of almost the last verse she had read to him, where among the glories of the Heavenly Home it was told how the City had no need of the sun ; â\\x80\\x98 for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.â\\x80\\x99 Then, as she opened the Bible, her eye fell, verse after verse, upon his favourite words ; and they, too, crept into her heart and comforted it. Directly she could, in any degree, let her mind stretch itself to take in the faintest realization of what was now his joy, the healing process was begun. But she was so very young that both life and sorrow seemed endless. Perhaps the companionship of Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, when she nerved herself to go down, was better for her than Madame Sansonâ\\x80\\x99s motherly pity and petting. Madame was a little touched at first at sight of her white sad face ; but no impression that was not connected with herself could last long, and she soon fell into her old sharp ways. Ursule for some time was too apathetic to heed themâ\\x80\\x94like a person stunned by a severe shock, by whom all lesser touches are unfelt ; more than once she found herself wondering over the idea that such petty annoyances could have ever affected her. Yet, with it all, the blow was not so crushing as it would have been a month or two earlier. She had tasted something of the Infinite Love, had learned a lesson of trust, had seen thei66 ONE YEAR. blessing of the peace of God. Often she thanked Him that Louis had insisted upon her facing the prospect of separation, and that thus they had been able to talk openly of what lay at their hearts. Because at the end there had been no time for itâ\\x80\\x94 no last messages, no tender words ; and there might have been a dreadful blank in her remembrances, instead of the treasured sentences now always to be kept there. They came back one by one, and it was the recalling something he had said which first startled her with the thought that her grief was selfish in its absorption, and that she had no right to tell herself that she was left alone and forlorn in the struggle of life. That thought led on to the conviction that the little weari 172 some duties from which she shrank as yet were the veiy work which was given her to do, and she made up her mind to set them aside no longer. Their small stock of money would have been exhausted, had not one of her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s pictures been sold to a dealer j ust at the time when Louis was at his worst ; but Ursule did not know how Madame Sanson had worked for it, and gone about among all her friends until she achieved her object. She did know enough, however, to make her feel that nothing she could do could sufficiently repay the care and kindness Madame had lavished on the sick boy, and she hoped to show her gratitude in the little ways which alone were possible to her. There was no such debt owing to Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny ; but here she was bound by Louisâ\\x80\\x99 wishes, and even if he had not besought her to be kind and gentle, there was the humbling remembrance of how often she had grieved him with her loss of temper and impatience towards Madame to keep her on her guard against such failures now. But the task was far harder than it might have been in past days. Madameâ\\x80\\x99s complaints of her back grew worse, and herâ\\x80\\x98 ADIEU DONC, BELLE FRANCE.â\\x80\\x99 167 helplessness and irritation increased also. No patience could win gratitude ; no sympathy satisfied. The only person, absent or present, whom she absolved from blame was her nephew. The only thing in her life which seemed to give her pleasure was a letter from him. One morning Ursule found her, having received one, reading it for the second time. â\\x80\\x98 So you are come at last ! â\\x80\\x99 It was her invariable greeting. â\\x80\\x98 Have you wanted anything, Madame ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Your usual foolish question! Yes, I have wanted a great many things; but I have learned never to expect so much as common attention. Times are changed, indeed, since I was young.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What can Ido?â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, patiently. â\\x80\\x98 Nothing. That is just of what I complain. I lie awake in the night, and think whether anything in this house can give me pleasureâ\\x80\\x94distraction from all I have to endureâ\\x80\\x94and I answer myself, No. You can do nothing. It is very hard that I cannot be as other people areâ\\x80\\x94that I should be alone, with 172 out relations or friends such as I ought to have. And, as if that was not bad enough, now when, for the sake of the advantages I expected you to derive, I forced myself to undertake that unfortunate journey, I am rewarded by the frightful accident which is carrying me to my grave. Oh, it is, in spite of what you say ! You would believe it if you had any feeling; but no one understands me, except my nephew.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule did not know what to answer. She asked whether Mr. Blunt was coming back again. â\\x80\\x98 Do you suppose that persons in his position can employ their time as they will ? My nephew has sufficient good feeling to do all that I could desire ; but there are exigencies which cannot be forgotten. Also, there is his mother. No,â\\x80\\x99 continuedi68 ONE YEAR. Madame, dreamily, â\\x80\\x98 he cannot come, but FÃ©licitÃ© greatly desires that I should join her and him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98In England, Madame?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Where else? If it were not for the voyage, the journey ;â\\x80\\x94 but no, it is impossible. I could not undertake it ; although FÃ©licitÃ© is so determined when once she has set her heart upon a thing, that there is no contradicting her. You were to go, too, child.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes; she desires it.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule smiled a little scornfully at the idea of this unknown strong-willed Madame Blunt influencing her movements ; but the smile died away in wonder that she should have been men 172 tioned or wished for. She could not resist asking, â\\x80\\x98And why, Madame?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 That I am not to tell you. If I go, you go ; that is all I know.â\\x80\\x99 Such a disposal of herself was irritating, and the girl had much ado to keep back a sarcastic answer, instead of the words, â\\x80\\x98The house will be very strange without you, Madame, if you should decide upon the journey.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I have already told you that you will be with me,â\\x80\\x99 Madame said, angrily. â\\x80\\x98 And my father ? Is he to find both of us gone ? â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, in a low voice. â\\x80\\x98 He has never done himself any good, and he will never do you any good,â\\x80\\x99 answered Madame, with decision. â\\x80\\x98 I hate selfishness myself, and I know that all men are selfish, except perhaps Clement ; but, of selfish men, your father exceeds all. You will not think of him, I hope?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x98 ADIEU DONC, BELLE FRANCE.â\\x80\\x99 169 â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, â\\x80\\x98after all, my going is not the question. You are not going yourself, Madame.â\\x80\\x99 And the thought scarcely crossed her mind again, except as a cause of wonder that Clement Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s mother should desire to see her. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, however, continually harped upon the one string. It was curious to see how, even in the distance, FÃ©licitÃ©â\\x80\\x99s more powerful will influenced her less decided sister. Evidently, in the old days her wishes had been imperative ; and now a letter dictated by her, and written by Clementâ\\x80\\x94who could not venture to soften his motherâ\\x80\\x99s words, since she insisted always upon reading the letter before it was sentâ\\x80\\x94was sufficient to set Madame in a fidget of anxiety as to the possibility of obeying what sounded very like a command. Her own weak 172 ness, instead of diminishing, increased ; she had not even been out since her return to the old house, and no one could have been more unfit for the journey. Madame Sanson cried out in horror at the very thought of her undertaking it. Yet â\\x80\\x98FelicitÃ© desires it â\\x80\\x99 seemed to have an influence which, in spite of the many years it had slumbered, was almost more powerful than all the reasons common prudence could advance. â\\x80\\x98 Ursule,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame Sanson, one evening, when the two women, old and young, were sitting together in the little glazed room, Madame with her feet upon a chauffe-pied, for the autumnal evenings were becoming a little chilly, â\\x80\\x98 who do you think has been to see me to-day ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How can I guess ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, not so very long ago, you might have guessed quickly enough. But now I admit he is a stranger.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule did not answer ; but the tears sprang into her eyes. Pierre Renait was inseparably bound up with the days which170 ONE YEAR. appeared to be parted from her by a great gulf. Madame looked curiously at her. â\\x80\\x98 All the town talks about the magnificence of his bride/ said she. â\\x80\\x98 Poor Pierre ! â\\x80\\x99 Ursule answered, simply, â\\x80\\x98 I hope he is very happy ; he was always good to Louisâ\\x80\\x94always.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Whether he is very happy or not, I neither know nor care,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, who, with womanly inconsistency, was disposed to find fault with Pierre for the very line of conduct which she herself had advocated; â\\x80\\x98but, at the bottom of all his little foolishnesses, he has not a bad heart. He has been here more than once to ask after you ; and this time he begged me to tell him whether you needed anything. Tims, Ursule, I believe he would yet give you anything he possessed.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I believe he would,â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, with a touch of dignity which made Madame feel a little ashamed of her words, â\\x80\\x98 for Louisâ\\x80\\x99 sake. But,â\\x80\\x99 she continued, kneeling down at her old friendâ\\x80\\x99s side, with a pretty caressing gesture, * did you tell him that I had better friends than he could be ? I want no more, Madame.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And you will not desert us, and go to that cold, foggy England ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I ? No, indeed.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Madame will not rest until she gets there, and thenâ\\x80\\x94I fore 172 tell the restâ\\x80\\x94any baby might see it,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame Sanson, throwing out her hands. â\\x80\\x98 She will be starved to death, with all their proprieties and stiffnesses. Not so much as the sun will be left to warm her poor old heart.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But Mr. Blunt would take care of her, do you not think so?â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, doubtfully. * Perhaps, yes ; perhaps, no. He is half French, to be sure ;1 adieu donc, belle France: 171 but then he could not help himself : he must be different there. And as to his motherâ\\x80\\x94see her letters ! Ursule, why does she want you so much ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Is it not strange ? I cannot tell.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You must not go.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Listen, Madame. Since I have not had him, I think more and more of things which he used to say to me. Many of them, which seemed to be forgotten, have come back lately. And it always grieved him about our father. No. Listen to me patiently: I want you to help me. You know that my father used to be a little bit fond of me ; sometimes what I said he attended to, when he cared for no one else : but I was only the more angry with him for it, I could not bear that Louis should be set aside, and I thought of. You know how ill I have always behaved to him. You know that it is no wonder that he should stay away so long. But I have been punished ; I was punished when I saw Louis pining to see him once more. If I had been different, he might have clung more to his home. And,â\\x80\\x99 with a resolute compression of her mouth, â\\x80\\x98 now that the past can never be undone, one must think of the future. When my father comes, I am determined that he shall not wish to go away again.â\\x80\\x99 It was a disjointed speech, but none the less earnest. Ma 172 dame, who had sat humping her back, and trying to look un 172 impressionable, came round before it was finished. â\\x80\\x98 Well,â\\x80\\x99 said she, shrugging her shoulders, and giving a quaint little grimace of disapproval, â\\x80\\x98 if you are bent upon making a victim of yourself, I cannot prevent it. I dare say you are right. But this I say, that you had better keep me out of Jean Lafonâ\\x80\\x99s way ; for, as for not telling him something of what he deserves, I canâ\\x80\\x99t do it.â\\x80\\x99172 ONE YEAR. It was plain that Ursule would have little help here. She sat silent for a moment or two ; then she said, â\\x80\\x98 So, you see, I shall not go to England.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 A la bonne heure] cried Madame, with one of her quick changes of mood ; â\\x80\\x98 thatâ\\x80\\x99s the best thing your father has brought about for a long time. Yes, yes, child, stay at home; reform him, and take care of us in our old age.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule was touched to see tears in Madameâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. They brought her the first real conviction that, after all, there was love about her, though not such a love as she had lost, and the young heart rebounded to the touch. She grew more animated than Madame had seen her yet, and made up her mind that here, in devotion to her father and her kind old friend, lay the life-work about which she had thought much lately. But it is not often that our life-work discloses itself beyond the hour or the day. A month passed, and September came. Jean Lafon had been absent ever since June ; and although once or twice he had written, he had given no opportunity for an answer. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny grew more helpless and more complain 172 ing, and still talked of her journey to England. But one morning Madame Sanson came up as hastily as she could to Ursule. â\\x80\\x98Comeâ\\x80\\x94come, quickly, child. There is some fresh news, which has made her like a mad woman ! â\\x80\\x99 In effect, Madame was more excited than Ursule ever re 172 membered having seen her, wringing her hands, gesticulating, sobbing, and entreating them all to hasten, without saying for what. It was many minutes before she let fall anything to en 172 lighten them, although a letter, with an English post-mark, in her lap showed from what quarter the disturbance came.â\\x80\\x98 ADIE U D ONC, BELLE EE ALICE.\\' 17 3 â\\x80\\x98See, dear Madame,â\\x80\\x99 Ursule said, soothingly, â\\x80\\x98what would you have us do ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The boatâ\\x80\\x94the steamer.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98There, itâ\\x80\\x99s the English boat she talks of,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame Sanson, putting the girl aside. â\\x80\\x98 Madame expects some one ; is not that it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Shall I never be understood? Has no one common per 172 ception ? Can you not so much as find out at what hour we must start?â\\x80\\x99 The girl and Madame Sanson looked at each other. Ma 172 dame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny broke out again more vehemently, â\\x80\\x98 I tell you there is no time to lose, with FÃ©licitÃ© illâ\\x80\\x94perhaps dying. Where are my things ? How slow you are ; you will never be ready ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Are you going to England, Madame ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Have I not said so twenty times over ? and can you not see that in the letter ? â\\x80\\x99 Taking this as a permission, and hoping to put an end to the entanglement of cross-interrogations, Ursule read the letter, written in Clementâ\\x80\\x99s bold English hand, although consisting of his motherâ\\x80\\x99s wordsâ\\x80\\x94broken, but as emphatic as everâ\\x80\\x94-desiring her sister and Ursule Lafon to come at once. A postscript from Clement himself gave the key:â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 She has been very ill, but is slightly revived. If you can bear the journey, come. The doctor says she is suffering from great anxiety to see you and Mademoiselle Lafon ; and we fear the consequences if she is disappointed. As vigorous in mind as ever, but all her bodily powers Shattered. I will meet you at Newhaven, for nothing else will content her; otherwise, as you may conceive, I should not leave her.â\\x80\\x99 Underneath was written again, â\\x80\\x98 Pray come.â\\x80\\x99I 74 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 And Madame really means to go ? â\\x80\\x99 said Madame Sanson, comprehending at last. â\\x80\\x98It will kill me; but what can I do? If FÃ©licitÃ© has set her heart upon it, she will not rest in her grave unless I go,â\\x80\\x99 answered Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, subsiding into tears. She was so utterly miserable, unreasonable, and overcome, that they could only look pityingly at her, and hastily think what was the best thing to be done. It was at the same time almost a relief to remember that the hour for the departure of the English steamer was already past. â\\x80\\x98 I will collect your things, Madame,â\\x80\\x99 Ursule said. â\\x80\\x98 It is too late for to-day ; besides which, by to-iporrow you will have recovered yourself. M. Blunt knows all about the boats; he will not expect you until to-morrow.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You are coming also?â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, eagerly. â\\x80\\x98 No, indeed, I cannot. I will see you on board, and M. Clement will meet you.â\\x80\\x99 She expected an outbreak of anger ; but Madame only burst into tears, and said no one had any thought for her. â\\x80\\x98 FÃ©licitÃ© desires it, FÃ©licitÃ© desires it,â\\x80\\x99 she said, crying feebly, in a manner which distressed and bewildered poor Ursule. â\\x80\\x98 Dear Madame, I have no right to go, and give up my father.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, your fatherâ\\x80\\x94your father, whom you respect so greatly, and who cares so much for you ! Has your father ever been to you what I have been? And you leave me to go alone among strangers.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I cannot go to England,â\\x80\\x99 she repeated, in a trembling voice, feeling as if her resolution could scarcely hold out. Fortunately Madame Sanson came to her support. â\\x80\\x98You see, Madame, it is no use to contradict nature; leave her alone, and let us see what you most need for your journey.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x98 ADIE U D ONC, BELLE FRANCE.â\\x80\\x99 17 5 In the midst of the altercation, and the tears which followed, Madame Sanson put her finger to her lips in sign of silence. Tramp, tramp, came a manâ\\x80\\x99s step up the stairs. Ursule, too, heard it, and turned pale. She stood motionless for a moment to collect her thoughts, then slipped out of the door, and up the stairs after the step. The young girl went up hastily ; the door of her room was already open, and just as she entered the man had flung himself down on a chair, and was unstrapping a heavy knapsack from his shoulders. It was, as she knew, her father. â\\x80\\x98 One of you at last,â\\x80\\x99 he said, drawing down her face to his level, and kissing her airily on both cheeks. â\\x80\\x98 I was beginning to wonder whether the nest was altogether deserted, and no one left to say â\\x80\\x9c Soyez le bienvenu.\" â\\x80\\x99 He was a little fresh-complexioned man, with a broad fore 172 head, eyes that carried in them a certain sense of humour and enjoyment, but with a sudden falling-off in the narrow tapering jawâ\\x80\\x94a face that could be pleasant while he was pleased, and perhaps signified that he would not greatly scruple at the means by which his pleasure was to be obtained. He held his daughter an armâ\\x80\\x99s length from him, and looked her up and down with a critical eye. * You have lost your roundness of cheek, and have not im 172 proved in appearance since last I saw you, child. Heavens, if girls, with all their vanity, would only consider that to lose their look of youth is like losing the bloom off a peach, and take a little more pains to preserve it ! And why, since you always wear a dark dress, do you not perceive that a spot of colour is wanted somewhere ?â\\x80\\x94on your bosom, in your hair, where you will, so long as there is some lightening of the sombre effect. You have not employed your advantages, Ursule, as an artistâ\\x80\\x99s daughter. How is Louis ? â\\x80\\x99178 ONE YEAR. Here you are under the protection of our admirable Monsieur and Madame Sansonâ\\x80\\x94does his appetite continue as absorbing as ever?â\\x80\\x94and our still more amiable Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny. I am convinced you will be invaluable to them as a daughter. I have brought you something with which to go on, and I do not mind promising you more regular remittances. Art is in demand, and your mother-in-law possesses substantial advantages which, I feel, are likely to prove a comfort to me in my declining years. Have you any particulars to suggest ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98You mean, that you leave me to my 172 self?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I have the most perfect confidence in your discretion,â\\x80\\x99 he said, drawing out a cigar and proceeding to light it ; â\\x80\\x98 and I can pay you no higher compliment.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny goes to England to-morrow.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And wishes you to go with her ? The very thing, my dear child. How fortunate that I should have arrived to-day, just in time to remove any lingering scruples on my account ! The tour will enlarge your mind, and it is not improbable that you may fascinate a rich Englishman. Do not forget my picturesâ\\x80\\x94 a few orders would not come amiss ; for however much one may despise their views of art, they have always the merit of paying well. My dear Ursule, I congratulate you.â\\x80\\x99 She could not answer. However much his long absences had separated him from his children, there was something inde 172 scribably bitter in this ready renunciation. The only comfort she feltâ\\x80\\x94and this was uncertainâ\\x80\\x94was a doubt whether he was as easy about it as he represented himself. He moved a little restlessly as he spoke, and he still, as much as possible, avoided looking at her ; but his manner absolutely repelled all tender 172 ness, although he showed no unkindness until, upon his risingâ\\x80\\x98 ADIEU DONC, BELLE FRANCE.â\\x80\\x99 and saying that he was going out, she offered to go with him : then his refusal was actually rough. â\\x80\\x98 Leave me alone. I want no one.â\\x80\\x99 She wondered at the change, especially when at the door he turned round in his usual easy way to ask whether he should make inquiries about the next dayâ\\x80\\x99s steamer. â\\x80\\x98 If you please,â\\x80\\x99 Ursule said, feeling as if she was in a dream, and a net was closing round her. When he was gone, she went slowly round the room, looking at this, that, and the other, as if she scarcely knew what she was doing ; then she walked out of the door, leaned over the balustrade, and looked up. Her pigeons were waiting for her on the edge of the roof, cooing and pluming themselves in the warm sunshine. Never had the sky looked a deeper, more intense blue. The beauty, the peace 172 fulness, were such as she had never realised before. To gaze into that wonderful depth, and to think of death, was to think of it without the sting ; to remember not the grave, but the resurrec 172 tion. â\\x80\\x98 I am not leaving him now,â\\x80\\x99 she said ; â\\x80\\x98 he is as near in one place as in another.â\\x80\\x99 She went down-stairs. Madame Sanson was waiting for her at the door. â\\x80\\x98 Well ? â\\x80\\x99 she whispered. â\\x80\\x98 It was my father. He came to tell us that he has married again. Hush ! â\\x80\\x99 she said, stopping Madameâ\\x80\\x99s voluble ejaculations. â\\x80\\x98And now you must let me go to England, dear Madame, since cer 172 tainly she wants me more than you do.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! â\\x80\\x99 Madame heaved a sigh of dismay. Ursule went into the room, and walked up to the old lady. Â£ I will go to England with you, if you desire it, Madame.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98FÃ©licitÃ© desires it,â\\x80\\x99 repeated Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny; â\\x80\\x98and of course you may go, child, as I have told you twenty times.â\\x80\\x99 22 2i8o ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Why does she want me ?â\\x80\\x99 asked the girl, with a sudden access of curiosity. â\\x80\\x98 You should not ask questions,â\\x80\\x99 answered Madame, looking mysterious, and treating her as she used in the days when she was a little child. There was hardly time for them. Ursule had as much on her hands as she could get through, with all Madam eâ\\x80\\x99s things and her own to put together, and only half help from Madame Sanson, who was an unwilling assistant, and thought the whole affair a folly. She worked with all her might to finish what required to be done, and to earn the quiet hour which she pro 172 mised herself before the evening set in. Her father was not much in the house. When he met Madame Sanson, he treated her with an imperturbable politeness, which irritated her more than any other line of conduct he could have pursued ; and he kept up the same impassable barrier between himself and his daughter. Ursule got out at last, feeling as if she must have time to think, and turning instinctively to the old haunts from which she used to draw the descriptions in which her brother delighted. She wandered into the cathedral, where already the evening shadows were gathering, and only a few solitary worshippers were sprinkled aboutâ\\x80\\x94peasant-women mostly, with their baskets by their side, having gone in there to offer a few fervent prayers before returning to their homes. Even the yellow wash and the tawdry disfigurements of the interior could not mar the solemnity of the scene. She went softly round to one of the side aisles, where were lovely little canopies, carved in stone so delicately that they looked like fretted lace-work. Her sense of the beautiful made her fonder of the venerable old church than of the bare ugliness which distinguished the little â\\x80\\x98Temple,â\\x80\\x99Ursule at hcr Brother\\'s Grave. P 256â\\x80\\x98 ADIE U DONC, BELLE FRANCE.â\\x80\\x99 181 as Madame persisted in calling it. She prayed more often, as she did on the day in question, in this church than her own. Coming out, her next point was Louisâ\\x80\\x99 grave. When she reached it, she saw that another had been beforehand ; for a wreath of immortelles, such as France produces by thousands, lay on the grave. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes brightened when she caught sight of it. Surely her father had done this, and he was not utterly callous. That conviction helped her more than any 172 thing else could have helped her through whatâ\\x80\\x94try as hard as she might to realise that the grave did not in truth hold himâ\\x80\\x94 would seem a leave-taking. It had been a comfort to her, when she was weary and inclined to despond, to steal away to the little quiet corner in the cemetery, and to feel as if there she was nearer him. Yet she did not wish him back again. Every remembrance of him was so pure and saintly, that it seemed unfit he should be mixed up with the sin and struggle of life. It was better that he should be taken from her than be wounded by such scenes as she had gone through that day. And it was a curious effect of her own deepening of character, that she felt as if she was only gradually, now that he was taken away, begin 172 ning to understand him. With all their intense love for each other, the two had, so to speak, lived in different elements ; and she had taken a great deal for granted as natural to his tempera 172 ment and to his state of health, which now she perceived to have been the result of constant watchfulness. Ursule almost triumphed in the thought of his superiority to herself. Then suddenly, with a burst of vehemence, she flung herself by the side of the grave, trembling, and crying out to him under her breath, giving way as she had not done since the funeral. The outbreak of tears relieved her ; she got up, and, with claspedlS2 ONE YEAR. hands, turned away, and hurried out of the cemetery, not daring to look round again. She had more to do, however, before she went back to the old house for the last time, and it was growing so late that she hurried along, past the fishermenâ\\x80\\x99s quarter and the harbour, to one of the houses, near the sea, where Pierre Renait and his bride were living with Monsieur and Madame Renait the elder. She went quickly up the stairs to the second flat, which was in the occupation of the young couple, and asked to speak to Monsieur Pierre. He was just coming out of the door of his room as she made the request, and, in the fading light, did not at first recognize her. When her voice revealed who his visitor was, she could hardly help smiling at the theatrical gesture in which he indulged ; it seemed to her so strangely out of place and unnatural now. She stopped him from speaking with a slight movement of her hand, and said hurriedly, â\\x80\\x98 Pardon my intrusion, M. Pierre ; I will not detain you for more than one little moment. Many months ago you had the goodness to execute a commission for usâ\\x80\\x94to dispose of a little picture, which had been painted by myâ\\x80\\x94my brother.â\\x80\\x99 Her voice faltered, but she went on : â\\x80\\x98 It is a strange thing in which to ask your assistance, but I am very desirousâ\\x80\\x94I would give all I have to buy it back again.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Mademoiselle â\\x80\\x99 stammered Pierre. â\\x80\\x98 If you will only tell me to whom it was sold, I ask no more. I am going away from Dieppe to-morrow. I have very little oÃ\\xad his belonging to me in the world. You wonder, I dare say, that I have not other drawings ; but his strength failed too rapidly for him to do more. I cannot tell you how thankful I should be to see it again.â\\x80\\x99 Pierre glanced rapidly back at the door. â\\x80\\x98 Mademoiselle,â\\x80\\x99 heâ\\x80\\x98 ADIEU DONC, BELLE FRANCE.â\\x80\\x99 said, advancing a step nearer, â\\x80\\x98 the person who possesses that painting values\\' it among his best treasures.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 He cannot value it as I do,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, simply. â\\x80\\x98 Indeed, M. Pierre,â\\x80\\x99 she continued, with a touch of her old decided manner, â\\x80\\x98 I have set my heart upon it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And you are leaving Dieppe ? â\\x80\\x99 he said, reproachfully. â\\x80\\x98To-morrow. There is no time to lose. I am sure you will assist me for Louisâ\\x80\\x99 sake.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Mademoiselle â\\x80\\x99 he wanted to assure her that there was nothing he would not do for her own sake ; but a certain quiet dignity in her manner keptâ\\x80\\x99him from any display of foolishness. She waited for him to finish his sentence, and, finding he hesitated, said earnestly, â\\x80\\x98 I have the money with me. Where shall I find the owner ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Mademoiselle â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94Pierre stepped on one side, laid his hand upon his heart, and made her a sweeping bowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 your charming portrait is in my possession : you do not ask to deprive me of it?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You bought it yourself!â\\x80\\x99 Ursule said, a pang crossing her mind at the remembrance of their happy castles in the air. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, M. Pierre, that was not right of you.â\\x80\\x99 He hastened to assure her that it was worth all he had paid for it ; that several judges had seen and admired it, and would gladly have given orders for its fellow ; and concluded by again entreat 172 ing her not to ask him to restore so highly valued a treasure. â\\x80\\x98 I know that you prize it for his sake,â\\x80\\x99 she said, gravely, â\\x80\\x98but not as I do. You do not know how little is left to me : I cannot give up this.â\\x80\\x99 He was not proof against her earnestness, and without another attempt at flowery language fetched and placed it in her hands. Tears sprang into her eyes as she looked at it, and Pierre,184 ONE YEAR. whose heart was easily touched, made an awkward though well-intentioned attempt at consolation. He tried to prevent her from giving back the money; but Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s will invariably carried the day, and it was the same now. She put out her hand, and said gratefully, â\\x80\\x98 Thank you, with all my heart. Thank you, too, for all your kindness to him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Is this adieu, Mademoiselle Ursule?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes. I go to-morrow to England, with Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny. An revoir, M. Pierre.â\\x80\\x99 He would have liked a more romantic parting ; but Ursule preserved the most common-place demeanour, so that he was obliged to content himself with a profound demonstration of respect in conducting her down the stairs, and out of the large double entrance-doors. Ursule smiled sadly, as she turned to 172 wards home, at the thought of Pierreâ\\x80\\x99s little weaknesses, which would have made her wholly contemptuous had not his con 172 nection with Louis rendered her patient towards him. â\\x80\\x98 Poor Pierre!â\\x80\\x99 she said to herself; â\\x80\\x98 evidently he spends more time than ever with the coiffeur. And yet he has such a good heart ! â\\x80\\x99 She was too utterly wearied out that evening to feel the strange change that was taking place in her life, and, when the next morning came, steeled herself for all that lay before her, with the determination not to break down. Her father was not altogether like himself, yet he made it as impossible as ever for her to show or extract the least display of affection. â\\x80\\x98 Such is life ! â\\x80\\x99 he said, waving his hands : â\\x80\\x98 the young birds quit the nest, and find new ones for themselves. Not a word, mon amie ; your conduct in this matter has been all that there is of admirable. You will be a daughter to that poor old lady ;â\\x80\\x98 ADIEU DONC, BELLE FRANCE: 185 and I shall console myself with thinking that your virtues are appreciated.â\\x80\\x99 Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny was miserably unfit for the journeyâ\\x80\\x94 crying and nervously irritable, but evidently in greater dread of neglecting FÃ©licitÃ©â\\x80\\x99s wish than of any suffering she might endure in obeying it. She was carried down-stairs and into the carriage that was to convey her to the steamer, Madame Sansonâ\\x80\\x94who, between her attempts at cheerfulness, gave way to piteous sobsâ\\x80\\x94 accompanying the pair of travellers. M. Sanson afforded the strongest proof of interest of which he had ever been proved capable. He left an omelette to its fate at the most critical period of its existence, and went out of the dark archway to wave his cap and wish Don voyage!â\\x80\\x99 Jean Lafon, on his side, clapped poor M. Sanson on the back with a vigour which de 172 prived him altogether of breath, and, kissing his hand as the carriage rolled away, exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98 A worthy trio, my friend, and one of which you have reason to be proud ! I have often remarked that there is in the feminine mind a fund of heroism which is sublime. That is as it should be, is it not? Nevertheless, were I you, I should prefer Madameâ\\x80\\x99s affections being less copiously supplied with tears : they are touching, but, to say the least of it, unbecoming. For myself, before my marriage with the present Madame Lafon, I exacted a promise that she would make a point of never weeping in my presence. It saves me a display of sympathy which might be forced, and her the pain of seeing me suffer. Allons ! shall I assist you in the omelette ? â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER XI. MADAM BLUNTâ\\x80\\x99S WILL. Thus some passing qualm to smother, Oft will man, too, treat his brother, Wronging one to right another. Rev. T. Whitehead. thought advisable that she should not undergo the difficulty of being carried up and down the steep descent for the few hours which the passage lasted. Ursule was too much occupied with her to have time to think of â\\x80\\x99her own feelings. When she turned to take a yearning look at the old town, they were already out of the harbour and well on their way. She fanciedâ\\x80\\x94 but it might have been fancyâ\\x80\\x94that she could distinguish Madame Sansonâ\\x80\\x99s figure waving farewells to them from the extremity of the pier, whither she had hurried from the place of embarka 172 tion; and she waved again in reply, though tears blotted out not only Madame, but the long beach, and the white houses, and the far-stretching line of white cliffs. The green waves, tipped with sunlit foam, were cheerful andMADAM BLUNTS WILL. 187 invigorating enough to make her for a while watch them with admiration ; but, before long, every sensation, save that of misery, was quenched, and she gave herself up to a despairing indifference to the worst that could happen to herself or her fellow-creatures. Fortunately Madame did not suffer any worse ailment than headache, and was able to dispense with her young companionâ\\x80\\x99s assistance, although feeling herself victimised by her helplessness, and disposed to blame her for giving way to it. But praise and blame were equally indifferent to Ursule, and she scarcely lifted her head until a compassionate fellow-voyager assured her that her troubles were nearly over, and that they would soon be at Newhaven. Never had the minutes seemed so long as between that promise and the time when she stag 172 gered to her feet, and looked despairingly round with the hope of seeing a friendly face among the crowd. None was there; and Madameâ\\x80\\x99s tremulous anxiety was beginning to grow into terrified bewilderment, when a man, who had been watching the pas 172 sengers land, came on board, and addressed himself to her in French, with the inquiry whether she was not Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny. Further words elicited the fact that Mr. Blunt was not there himself, but that the master of the hotel at Newhaven had that afternoon received a letter from him, which he would have the honour of showing to Madame, and in consequence of which he begged leave to place himself at her service, and to mention that he had made arrangements for her being conveyed to the hotel during the hour or two which Madame would probably require for rest before continuing her journey. In the midst of the bustle and the perplexities of hearing a strange tongue about them, the two women clung to their new friend as a protector ; and Clementâ\\x80\\x99s letter had provided for all arrangements that were necessary in carrying Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyi88 ONE YEAR. on shore. Before leaving Dieppe, Ursule had not had the time to dwell upon the minor trials which lay before her,, added to which, she had expected â\\x80\\x98to find Mr. Blunt waiting for them upon their arrival ; now she felt overwhelmed with her own helplessness, and frightened to remember that she knew nothing of English. Perhaps Mr. Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s letter would explain ; perhaps he was coming by a later train. She watched eagerly while Madame, in their little room at the hotel, opened the letter which her nephew had inclosed for her in that to the master. A paper fluttered out of it, which Ursule picked up and held in unconsciousness of its character. Madame gave a cry of dismay as she read, â\\x80\\x98 FÃ©licitÃ© is worse ! Clement does not like to leave her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Are we not to go, then, Madame ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, I do not know; all the words dance before my eyes. She must be very ill, and yet she was always so strongâ\\x80\\x94much stronger than I. Tiens, take the letter yourself; read quickly. What does he say? What is that name ? Salâ\\x80\\x94Salis â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Salisbury,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, spelling out the word with a pro 172 nunciation very unlike its own. â\\x80\\x98 Monsieur says that, after you have rested here a little while, we are to go to this town Salisbury, since it is too far for you to travel to Elmwood to 172 day. He says we must sleep there, and that he will send another letter there ; but we must hurry on as fast as possible, for that his mother asks continually for us both. Dear Madame, why can she wish so much for me ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, do not always think of yourself, Ursule,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, pettishly ; â\\x80\\x98 I am the person to be considered, I think. What are we to do ?â\\x80\\x94what will become of us ? I cannot imagine how it is that you should know nothing of English ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 M. Blunt says that he incloses you an order for money,MADAM BLUNT\\'S WILL. which the landlord here will change. This is it, no doubt,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, showing the cheque she held in her hand. â\\x80\\x98Yes; FÃ©licitÃ© undertook to pay for our journey. Oh, I cannot think what to do next ! â\\x80\\x99 Madame repeated, wringing her hands. â\\x80\\x98 Suppose we ask theâ\\x80\\x94the Monsieur who brought us here when the train will start for Salisbury ? â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, timidly pulling the bell. The Monsieur was very willing to assist his countrywomen, and had indeed received orders to that effect. He made every 172 thing as clear to them as he could, obliged Ursule to repeat over and over again, until she had a chance of being under 172 stood, the obnoxious name of Salisbury, and left them with the promise to return and take them to the train in which they were to start. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, wearied with the voyage and with her lamentations, fell asleep upon the hard sofa on which she was stretched. Ursule, tired as she was, felt far too much excited to sleep, and sat looking wistfully at the black horsehair furni 172 ture, which appeared to base its claims to respect upon its ugliness; the round table, with its red figured cloth and its burden of inkstand, woolly mats, and two or three gorgeously bound volumes of the â\\x80\\x98 Penny Magazine â\\x80\\x99 ; the never-failing bronze gas chandelier, all pulleys and chains ; the upright chif 172 fonier, with cruet-stand and shells ; on the walls, coronation prints and two or three domestic photographs. She looked at them ; but all the time she was thinking not so much of those she had left, as of those to whom she was goingâ\\x80\\x94of this in 172 flexible Madame Blunt, who had resolved to bring them to England, and had succeeded, whose desire to see her was as persistent as it was unaccountableâ\\x80\\x94of her son, Monsieur Cle-1 9 o ONE YEAR. ment, who had been good to Louis, but evidently, for some cause, disapproved of her. â\\x80\\x98 He has reason,â\\x80\\x99 Ursule said to herself, humbly and sadly. â\\x80\\x98 I dare say the young ladies he knows are good and useful, while I am of no use to any one. But why does Madame, his mother, want to see me?â\\x80\\x99 Puzzle over it as she might, there was no answer to be found to this question. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny did not awake until the Frenchman came in to say that the men were ready to carry her into the railway carriage. He did all that he could to lighten their difficulties, which looked formidable enough to the two inexperienced tra 172 vellers, especially when added to that dreadful shrinking from the train, which, although Madame had suffered most severely by the accident, seemed to affect Ursule more. He gave them a list of the chief stations through which they would pass, and enlisted the sympathy of the guard on their behalf ; so that he assured them they would not be left to their own unaided re 172 sources to reach Salisbury, where they would find that Mr. Blunt had written to a hotel-keeper to give them the same sort of reception as he had provided for them at Newhaven. In fact, Clement, in the midst of all his trouble on his motherâ\\x80\\x99s account, was sorely perplexed as to the best means of providing, in his hurry, for his helpless old aunt. If his mother was better, he intended, as he told her in a postscript, to meet her at Salis 172 bury ; and this hope buoyed up both Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny and Ursule until, very late in the evening, theyreached the termination of their journey, and were again condemned to disappointment. Ursule was certainly changed. No one could have been more trying during the day than Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny. She laid the blame of all that did or could happen against her wishes upon her companion, and prophesied more evil than one journeyMADAM BLUNTS WILL. could well contain. Ursule forced back her own fears to an 172 swer with a patience that rarely failed, and to try and divert her mind with remarks upon the country through which they passed â\\x80\\x94the bright, almost unknown green of the English fields, the sea, the churches, and the little hamlets nestling in picturesque hollows. Madame expatiated freely upon the girlâ\\x80\\x99s want of feeling in having the heart to notice such frivolities; but, nevertheless, her naÃ¯ve remarks assisted to while away the time, until, towards their journeyâ\\x80\\x99s end, Ursule was shocked to perceive how exhausted Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny was growing, and how much suffering the constant motion began to cause to her back. Matters did not go on as smoothly at Salisbury as at Newhaven, since the hotel could not produce a Frenchman ; and Ursule felt as if they were only parcels, treated without any will of their own, according to the directions written by Mr. Blunt. Luckily, these were explicit, and, between them and the use of signs, they managed to obtain all that they needed ; but Ursule, when she had assisted Madame into bed, and watched vainly for some sign of sleep, felt an uncomfort 172 able foreboding that all Mrs. Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s commands would not enable her sister to start again on the following morning. The commands never were issued. With the morning came a telegram from Clement, containing only the \\' words, â\\x80\\x98 If Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny has arrived, do not let her leave the hotel until she hears from me.â\\x80\\x99 In the middle of the day, a letter ex 172 plained the message. Mrs. Blunt had died the previous day ; and Clement, breaking the news as gently as possible to her sister, suggested her either coming on at once, or waiting at Salisbury until after the funeral, when he would fetch her himself. The news came upon Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny with as great a shock as if she had been wholly unprepared. That FÃ©licitÃ©,192 ONE YEAR. whom she had last seen strong, active, and determined, FÃ© 172 licitÃ©, with her keen bright eye and springy step, should be dead was utterly inconceivable. She had never so much as thought of her being old, in spite of Clementâ\\x80\\x99s descriptions. Descriptions and words, indeed, seldom give us an adequate idea of the change from youth to age, from strength to infirmity, in those we have known intimately. We hear of it; but, when we see it, we receive the sort of shock that a sudden transition from summer to mid-winter would cause. FÃ©licitÃ© had been a link with the youth of past years ; she thought of her as her child-companion, not as the old woman of upwards of three 172 score years and ten. She had never dwelt much upon her ill 172 ness ; she had set her heart upon the meeting, and nowâ\\x80\\x94FÃ©licitÃ© was gone. It was not so much the loss as the disappointment that she felt ; but Ursule did not analyse her feelings, and was greatly touched by a grief which she had not expected to see. Madameâ\\x80\\x99s first outcry was to go on, that she might see her sister again ; and neither of them understood how much longer time would elapse between the death and burial than was the case in their own country. However, it was very soon evident that Madame was not well enough to attempt to continue the journey : the news had taken away the spring of action which sustained her, and she gave way completely. Ursule was at her witsâ\\x80\\x99 end ; she would have gladly called in a doctor, but, added to Madameâ\\x80\\x99s dislike to the idea, there was the difficulty of making themselves understoodâ\\x80\\x94a difficulty which had proved serious enough with regard to the telegram. She was, fortunately, provided with the remedies Madame was in the habit of taking ; but this detention, with its solitary dreariness, was very different from their stay at the hospitable farm-house. The days were very long. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny could notMADAM BLUNTS WILL. *93 bear to be left alone, and Ursule sat by her bed, rubbed her back, read to her, and chatted as brightly as she could. On Sunday she gained leave to go to church, and, although she hesitated from venturing into the midst of a strange congrega 172 tion, and dreaded a service in a strange language, yet she longed for the refreshment which even the change from the sick-room would give. When she found herself in the cathedral, her en 172 joyment was intense. She had been inclined to believe that beautiful buildings and beautiful music belonged only to the Roman Catholic religion, and Salisbury Cathedral was her first assurance of the contrary. The singing was not above the average, but to Ursule it seemed angelic ; the organ, in its soli 172 tary state, far grander than the orchestral crash in the French churches. She lingered after the service was over, unwilling to tear herself away; and more than one looked with curiosity at the young girl, in her mourning dress, who listened with such rapt attention to the voluntary. But all that she related to poor Madame on her return only had the effect of increasing her misery. She had comeâ\\x80\\x94Heaven forgive her !â\\x80\\x94to a land of heretics, where her soul would be starved, where she could expect no comfort. She had come without advice, simply because FÃ©licitÃ© desired it, and, now FÃ©licitÃ© was dead, she was dying herself. Ursule would be left to shift for herself in a foreign country, and by that time she would realise a little of all that sheâ\\x80\\x94Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x94had endured for lier. It was a country of barbarians, where she could scarcely procure so much as a sucrierâ\\x80\\x94where everything was so terribly dear that the money melted away if you looked at itâ\\x80\\x94where the servants were insolent, the food coarse. What would she not give to find herself back with those good Sansons ! Ursule grew a little pale as Madame prognosticated her own rapid death and burial. 13194 ONE YEAR. It was true that, on looking back, she seemed to have run a great risk in making this change of country. Still, surely she had been right. How much worse would Madameâ\\x80\\x99s condition have been if she had travelled alone to England ! Certainly this sudden, unprepared-for event in the young girlâ\\x80\\x99s life was brightened by no happy dreams or golden visions : no soft misty haze hung over her fancies of the future ; yet the simple stead 172 fastness with which she faced the dreary monotony she saw before her promised better for her happiness than if she had been buoyed up by a hundred glowing anticipations. She had come to devote herself to Madame, and she had not even a wish to shrink from the task. She bought an English dictionary and a little book of phrases, and her position being the one exactly the most favourable to learning a language, she gradually made a little way towards being understood. Having a fire in the room, she was also able to prepare things for Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, to the intense scandal of the waiter. These were her amusements, and she contrived to extract out of them somewhat with which to enter 172 tain Madame. A letter came from Clement, promising that he would be with them the day after the funeralâ\\x80\\x94in two daysâ\\x80\\x99 timeâ\\x80\\x94and earnestly hoping that his aunt would be sufficiently recovered to return with him to Elmwood. She, for her part, insisted on the impossibility ; but Ursule perceived, from one or two words which she let drop, that her real intention was to go ; and her state of health appeared to hinge so completely upon her mind and will, that it was possible she might, indeed, brace herself to the effort. At all events, it was a comfort that she could be roused to think of action, for her spirits were growing worse and worse under the confinement and solitude of her present life.MADAM BLUNTS WILL. 195 On the morning of the day when her nephew was expected, Madame for the first time proposed to leave her bed ; and she also insisted upon Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s making everything ready to start, while, at the same time, protesting that her own departure was an impossibility. She sent Ursule into the town to procure some medicine ; and when she returned, Clement had arrived, and Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny was eager to leave at once. He would not agree to this, but persuaded her to wait for the next day ; and, in fact, the excitement of seeing him, and hearing all that he had to relate, was quite as much as her feeble strength would bear. Ursule herself had a day of libertyâ\\x80\\x94Madame wanted no one but her nephew ; and the girl rambled away for hours, with a sense of freedom which was a delight to one so little accustomed to restraint as she had been. She was never weary of looking at the Cathedral, and often she caught herself in the old habitâ\\x80\\x94 the hardest of all to break off after daily companionshipâ\\x80\\x94of storing up something to relate to Louis. She went through the streets and stared into the shops with a girlâ\\x80\\x99s delight. Then she crossed the meadows, and wandered along by the side of a delicious trout stream, rapid and clear as glass, and under trees just tinged with autumnal tints, and past cottages set in gardens blazing with scarlet geraniums and roses; and looked back upon the delicate grey spire rising out of the level, and down into the waving beds of weed in the river ; and at last walked reluctantly home, with a face so bright and cheerful, that Clement involun 172 tarily pronounced the same verdict of want of feeling. He was himself worn and wearied ; his motherâ\\x80\\x99s illness had ended in a comparatively sudden manner, and without any return of con 172 sciousness during the last two days. Until then she had been continually restless and agitated about seeing her sister and Ursule ; but after the third paralytic stroke there was unbroken196 ONE YEAR. insensibility. Ursule pitied him from her heart, when she saw his face, and understood how much the idea weighed upon him that Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny had given up her country and her home, and was in a manner dependent upon him. She tried all the more to speak hopefully of her state, and to raise his spirits ; and she succeeded in some measure, although only at the cost of strengthening his preconceived opinion. When he left the room, she was astonished at his saying that he would be glad to speak to her in the sitting-room he had engaged, whenever in the course of the evening she was able to leave his aunt ; but Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny herself treated it so lightly, and was so persuaded that he only wished to arrange matters for her comfort on the next day, that she felt ashamed of her own curiosity. She could not go down until rather late in the evening, when Madame was asleep. Clement opened the door in answer to her knock, and drew a chair for her near the fire. He was so long, however, in opening the conversation that she said, timidly, â\\x80\\x98 Did you wish to speak to me ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x99 he said, starting, â\\x80\\x98 I have no right to detain you ; but, to tell the honest truth, I was thinking how to begin. Mademoiselle, have you never wondered why my poor mother wished so greatly to see you ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes, very often,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, eagerly. â\\x80\\x98 I have asked Ma 172 dame frequently, but she always said that I must wait.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She left the explanation to my mother, and, now that it is too late for you to receive it from her lips, it is only due to you to explain it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I can wait still,â\\x80\\x99 said she, in a low voice, noticing his com 172 pressed lips.MADAM BLUNTS WILL r 97 â\\x80\\x98 Thank you. It is necessary that you should understand the matter without further delay. We must go back in your history, Mademoiselle Lafon. Your mother, I believe, died while you were very young ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Seven years old, Monsieur.â\\x80\\x99 replied Ursule, wondering what was coming. * And your grandfather and grandmotherâ\\x80\\x94do you remember them ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I can just remember something of my grandfather : but I was very little when he died ; and then we soon left Nantes and came to Dieppe.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And your grandmotherâ\\x80\\x99s name was â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Lagetâ\\x80\\x94Ursule Laget. I am called after her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Did your mother ever tell you stories about what happened to her when she was young, or that her father and mother had told her? Children have those sort of things told them, you know,â\\x80\\x99 continued Mr. Blunt, seeing that Ursule hardly knew what to make of his cross-questioning. â\\x80\\x98 She never had time for stories,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule. â\\x80\\x98 I canâ\\x80\\x99t recol 172 lect any.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then I will tell you one. Listen. A long time ago, when France was shedding blood without mercy, a little child was carried out to be shot in the horrible fusillades of Nantes. A man saved herâ\\x80\\x94a man who had no children of his own at that date, or he could hardly have consented to be one of the mur 172 derers of those little ones. He atoned for his sin by the act ; for it was at the peril of his own life that he managed to convey this little frightened child home to his wife ; it was at the peril of both their lives that he and she kept her with them until they could convey her to her friends at Bordeaux. Is this story new to you ? â\\x80\\x99198 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Quite.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But you have guessed something of the truth ? The little child was called FÃ©licitÃ© Devaux ; the man and his wife were Jacques and Ursule Laget.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It was your mother ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It was my mother whom your grandfather saved.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I am glad,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, clapping her hands. â\\x80\\x98 It is like a romance. But I never knew it ; how did you find it out ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Your name gave the clue. Somehow or other, my father and mother lost sight of your family after the death of your grandmother : my father intended to go to Nantes to make inquiries whom Marie Laget had married ; but he died, and my mother lost heart for everything. When first I heard your name, it sounded familiar to me; and, directly I mentioned it, my poor mother did not rest until she heard more. Do you not remem 172 ber Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s questions ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, yes ; how they puzzled me ! And it was this which made Madame Blunt desire to see me ? I wish â\\x80¢â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, divining what she would have said. â\\x80\\x98It is curious that she longed more earnestly to see youâ\\x80\\x94Ursule Lagetâ\\x80\\x99s grandchildâ\\x80\\x94than her own sister.â\\x80\\x99 Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes sparkled. â\\x80\\x98 I am sure I should have rnved her,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98This is not all that I have to notify to you, Mademoiselle,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, gravely. â\\x80\\x98 I should have let my aunt have the pleasure of repeating that little history, had there not been a sequel which was only known to me yesterday. I must ask you now to listen to details of a different nature. I can only pro 172 mise to make them as short as I can.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Go on, if you please, Monsieur.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You are aware, perhaps, that weâ\\x80\\x94my mother and Iâ\\x80\\x94haveMADAM BLUNTS WILL. 199 hitherto lived in a small cottage at Elmwood, close to the Rectory gate.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Plait-ill â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, looking bewildered. â\\x80\\x98Ah, well, never mind. I ought to have remembered that you could not be expected to know the localities. However, it is a cottage which my father at his death left to my mother, not for her use only, but absolutelyâ\\x80\\x94for her own, for her to give to whom she would, together with a sum of money amounting altogether to five thousand pounds.â\\x80\\x99 Clement did not add that this bequest was made because his father did not doubt that the money and the house would go to him as their natural channel; but he asked, â\\x80\\x98You understand me so far?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, certainly,â\\x80\\x99 answered Ursule, absently; for her thoughts had wandered away to the story of the fusillades of Nantes. â\\x80\\x98By a codicil of her will, lately executed, the Cottage at Elmwood, with a legacy of four thousand pounds, is left to Mademoiselle Ursule Lafon, and to her heirs for ever.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I beg your pardon, Monsieur,â\\x80\\x99 said poor Ursule, trying to collect her thoughts, and feeling guilty of having got herself into a puzzle by her inattention. â\\x80\\x98 I am afraid I do not com 172 prehend.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The Cottage is given to you by my mother.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 To me ! Oh, Monsieur, it must all be a mistake ? â\\x80\\x99 Clement thought so himself. The idea of his old home falling into the hands of this French girl was indescribably bitter. But he could only assure her that it was as he had said. â\\x80\\x98 The house and the money,â\\x80\\x99 he repeated. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s head was in a whirl. â\\x80\\x98 Is it not rightly yours?â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98 I have enough,â\\x80\\x99 answered Mr. Blunt, shortly. â\\x80\\x98 The person to be most pitied is my aunt. She receives only a thousand pounds.â\\x80\\x99200 ONE YEAR. It is enormous ! â\\x80\\x99 sighed Ursule, to whom either sum seemed like a fabulous amount, especially when Mr. Blunt reduced them into francs ; â\\x80\\x98 but I see that I have the most. Ought not Ma 172 dame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny to have mine ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, smiling for the first time, and poking the fire into a cheerful blaze. â\\x80\\x98 There are your heirs, you know, to be considered ; and you have no right to give it away. Do not talk about what you will do to-night ; we will all go back to the Cottage to-morrow, and then you shall think it over.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But I may speak of it to Madame ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No ; I must ask you to say nothing. I would rather tell my aunt myself ; and she is not fit to bear additional excitement of any kind until the journey is over.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I think this must all be a dream,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, standing up to go, and rubbing her eyes. Clement lit her candle, and opened the door. â\\x80\\x98 Good night, Mademoiselle Lafon,â\\x80\\x99 he said. She reproached herself on the stairs with having forgotten his loss, and the pain it must have given him to mention details, in the midst of her own wonder. It was more wonder than delight ; the whole affair seemed so inexplicable, so strange, that she could scarcely believe she had heard aright. Of course, the Cottage and the money would be as much Madameâ\\x80\\x99s as hers ; they might live there, and Mr. Blunt also : she had even visions of M. and Madame Sanson joining them; and yet she shook her head at the idea of living in England. All her thoughts were in confusion, and her dreams that night were not more unconnected than were her waking fancies. Mr. Blunt, meanwhile, thought bitterly of the change that hung over his head : it was a dreadful wrench to him to quit the Cottage ; and he did not like the prospect of his old auntâ\\x80\\x99sMADAM BLUNTS WILL. 201 dependence upon this young, inexperienced, and, as he believed, selfish girl, whose generosity, although it might be equal to spasmodic efforts, would give way under any continuous strain. He wished that his mother had taken him into her confidence, and that he had persuaded her to reverse her gifts. He shrank from the task of telling Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny. She had given up all her habits of life, and made an immense effort to fulfil her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s wishes, and naturally would be hurt at a stranger re 172 ceiving this proof of preference. To make an arrangement for her would be his first care. Probably, Ursule would choose to let the Cottage as soon as the business-matter was explained to her, and return to France, to escape a country life which could have few charms for one totally unaccustomed to it. Dieppe was not Paris, certainly ; but it possessed a certain stir and excite 172 ment very much beyond anything to be found at Elmwood, which made Clement almost smile at the comparison. And for himself? Well, that question was tolerably easy to answer. Since the Cottage was gone, he must take up his quarters altogether in Defforton, instead of going there by train every morning. Whether he could afford to support his aunt with him as wellâ\\x80\\x94whether he could endure the continual re 172 straint which her presence would cost himâ\\x80\\x94whether she would herself be happy in the positionâ\\x80\\x94these were points which must be well weighed before decided upon, and he had scarcely strength or spirit for them as yet. He would wait. A day or two might assist him in the decision. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny would know the facts, and form her own wishes. Clement did not cast one thought of blame on his mother for the burden that was brought upon him, but he could not shut his eyes to the fact that a burden it must be. The next morning found Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny suffering no202 ONE YEAR. little pain, but eager to be off. She would not even remain until the later train, which Clement thought would have given her time to rest ; and the only means of quieting the restless 172 ness which, at such times, grew actually distressing to witness was by forestalling the time fixed for their departure. They travelled in greater comfort this time, with Mr. Blunt to depend upon, and Ursule could sit quietly in the corner of the carriage, and look out at the beautiful trees, only losing their summer roundness to gain a glory in colour, at the grey homesteads, the quiet little streams patiently making their way through the fields, the stacks of corn, and the heaps of yellow apples in the orchards, which looked like Normandy. The wind was high ; grey clouds drifted across the sky ; here and there a bit of soft blue shone out between them. Mr. Blunt wondered why Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s face, remarkable for its quick changefulness of expres 172 sion, had settled into that of calm, peaceful happiness. He was apt to be obstinate in his opinions, and he determined that she was looking forward to all that was before her, and to the com 172 parative riches she was to enjoy. Never was anything further from her mind. She was thinking, as all beautiful things made her think, of Louisâ\\x80\\x94his love and his happiness. To have lost him was to have lost the better half of herself ; but not for an instant now did she grudge him what he had received. He had entered into his rest, and for her there was the work yet to do. The work ! Yes. With all her weakness, her failures, her wilfulness, there was the life-work which only the strongest could accomplishâ\\x80\\x94a prospect which might well have cast her back despairing, had she not learned in that very time, which seemed the darkest in her life, to know that, would she but cling to the unfailing truth, there was for her a Strength that was supreme.CHAPTER XII. ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s welcome. â\\x80\\x9c Whoâ\\x80\\x99s he ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Dunno.

If you want to find a town, you must go back to Defforton, through which we passed.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah ! â\\x80\\x99 Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny looked gloomy ; Ursule watched every turn of the road with interest. â\\x80\\x98 I do not see any acacia-trees,â\\x80\\x99 she said, at last, in her turn. â\\x80\\x98No; but these elms are finer than your poplars,â\\x80\\x99returned Mr. Blunt, jealous for the honour of the Elmwood trees. â\\x80\\x98 Bah ! what villanous roads ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, a little malici 172 ously, as the fly jolted over a new layer of stones. Clement felt unreasonably indignant, forgetful that he had himself provoked the retort by his comparison. The three204 ONE YEAR. drove on in silence, until he pointed out the glimmer of blue sea in the distance, as an object which belonged alike to both countries, and was almost pacified by Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s exclamation of admiration at the soft red colouring of the earth. Presently, he touched Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s arm. â\\x80\\x98 You cannot see more than a corner of the tower ; but the church is thereâ\\x80\\x94just hidden by that clump of treesâ\\x80\\x94and the churchyard where she is buried.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Not in the cemetery ! Poor FÃ©licitÃ© ! â\\x80\\x99 There was silence again for a few moments, when Mr. Blunt showed them the entrance to the Rectory, and in another minute the fly stopped. â\\x80\\x98 This is the Cottage,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, gravely. The Cottage, which fully answered to its name, stood back perhaps twenty feet from the high road. First came a green paling, then a little grass-plot, in one corner of which stood a fine horse-chestnut overhanging the road. Flowers were dotted about in small bright masses, and the covered-way of trellis- work which led to the house was twined over with clambering plants. The Cottage was long and irregularly built ; thatched, moreover, to Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s great wonder. An old servant came to the door, in whose face was written anything but welcome : between them, Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny was carried into a passage, up a few stairs into a tiny hall, and then into a drawing-room of much better size and proportion than might have been expected from the appearance of the house. There was a bright fire burning, and it looked home-like and cheerful. Two long French windows opened upon the garden, which on this side was of considerable extent, walled all round, and broken with picturesque clumps of treesâ\\x80\\x94a young and beautifully shaped cedar and two handsome ilexes among the number. Every-URSULES WELCOME. 205 thing grew luxuriantly : rhododendrons feathered grandly over the grass ; great fuchsias towered into shrubs, roses peeped over the wall; a venerable myrtle-tree and a white jessamine fairly covered one side of a gable, and pushed their branches into the thatch. On one side of the drawing-room was a conservatory, into which a door opened. From it, you could in a moment reach an old-fashioned kitchen-garden, which never failed to produce its annual abundant store of fruitâ\\x80\\x94a garden with sunny nooks where rosy strawberries ripened, and white-heart cherries grew yellow and waxy. From the top of the garden, near a greenhouse, in which the finest grapes flourished without further heat than that of a Devonshire sun, you gained a good idea of the irregularities and length of the Cottage, and a delightful view of the sea, the red cliffs, and the harbour, with its shipping and long sandy reach, on the southern side. Ursule did not see all this at once. She was enchanted with the house and garden; but she did not dare openly to display much delight when she imagined Mr. Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s feelings, and encountered Sarahâ\\x80\\x99s hostile glances. She scarcely thought of it in the way they were thinkingâ\\x80\\x94that it was her own ; only as a charming place where they were all perhaps going to live, and which looked too bright and flowery for the tristesse she had anticipated. A bunch of flowers on the table were so prettily arranged, that Ursule could not resist saying, * How pretty ! â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Blunt looked at them as he was giving Sarah the keys to bring wine for his aunt, and thought the same. â\\x80\\x98 Who put them there ? â\\x80\\x99 he asked. â\\x80\\x98 Miss Elsie, Sir,â\\x80\\x99 said Sarah, severely. â\\x80\\x98She came this morn 172 ing, before I knew what she was about, or for certain I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have allowed her to mess up any such nonsense.â\\x80\\x992o6 ONE YEAR. Clement translated as much of the speech as he thought advis 172 able ; and Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes brightened at the idea of this Mademoi 172 selle Elsie, who had effected a little friendly act of welcome. She wished to be on amicable terms with everybody. When Sarah brought in the tray, she ran to help her so deftly and readily, that the old servant almost relented; but Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny called her back to her side with a sharp â\\x80\\x98 Ursule ! â\\x80\\x99 Madame felt her own dignity bound up in her companion, and feared lest the conduct of the latter might betray the manner in which they had lived. A terrible chilliness grew over the whole party. Clement, however much he exerted himself, could not be otherwise than grave and silent ; Madame looked sadly round at the memorials of FÃ©licitÃ© ; Ursule began to recognize the position in which she stood, and to feel as if her new possessions would not bring her much pleasure. It was a relief when a young retriever appeared at the window, and made such demonstrations of joy at seeing his master, that it became necessary to open the window and allow him to expend his delight in ecstatic capers. â\\x80\\x98 I have rested sufficiently to go to my room,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, wearily. â\\x80\\x98 It is close at hand,â\\x80\\x99 Clement said ; â\\x80\\x98 we have only to get you up a few steps, and you will be in it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98This is a pretty place, Clement. Poor FÃ©licitÃ©, she must have had all that she could want ! Everything is yours, I sup 172 pose?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You shall hear the arrangements to-morrow,â\\x80\\x99 answered Mr. Blunt ; while Ursule felt herself becoming hot and red. â\\x80\\x98 After you are settled in your room, I shall walk over to the Rectory ; and, if Mademoiselle is not tired â\\x80\\x99URSULE\\'S WELCOME. 207 â\\x80\\x98 Do not call her Mademoiselle,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, sharply. â\\x80\\x98She is Ursule Lafon.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If you are not tired,â\\x80\\x99 repeated he, without taking any notice except to address her directly, â\\x80\\x98 I dare say you will like to go into the garden by-and-bye. You wonâ\\x80\\x99t lose yourself; and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know that there is anything very wonderful for you to see. But there are plenty of grapes in the greenhouse, if you will take the trouble to gather them.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Thank you. I â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ursule will have enough to do in attending to me,â\\x80\\x99 inter 172 posed Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny for the second time ; and Clement gave up the attempt to provide amusement for his guest. It was late in the afternoon before she was released by Madameâ\\x80\\x99s falling asleep, and then she was too tired herself to do much in the way of exploring. She went to her own room, full of de 172 light at the quaint room, with its steps, angles, and crannies, its paper of twining roses, its green paint, and, above all, its old-fashioned window-seat, on which perching herself, she found the harbour and the sea lying before her, looking grey and angry in the fading light, and with a rising wind foretelling a storm. Presently she was glad to go down to the deserted drawing 172 room, and to sit over the fire, learning diligently from her phrase-book by the light of the flickering flame Clement, meanwhile, had not far to walkâ\\x80\\x94the green gate which led into the Rectory shrubbery was almost within a stoneâ\\x80\\x99s throw of the Cottage doorâ\\x80\\x94Jock, in high delight at possessing his master at an unusual hour of the day, bounding before him, and relieving his spirits by hunting imaginary foes with an energy which was altogether superfluous. The gate swung heavily behind Clement as he walked up the drive towards the house ; on each side lay the shrubbery, faced by a narrow border208 ONE YEAR. of flowers and grass. The Rectory itself was an old red brick house, mellowed by age into the colour of sandstone, and built squarely and solidly, with a good substantial porch and broad windows. Two or three tall climbers, a glossy-leaved banksia rose, and a Virginian creeper softened the rather hard outlines ; and, in front of the house, the grass sloped away towards fields and treesâ\\x80\\x94the sea, of course, visible, and making the point of the picture. The garden was not in the same good order as that at the Cottage ; the shrubs wanted cutting back, and the creepers nailing. Clement stooped to pull up an obtrusive piece of groundsel which grew out of a clump of carnations close to the door. Jock, giving a sigh of resignation, lay down outside the porch, his nose between his paws, but his watchful eyes contradicting his attitude of rest. Passing through a substantial, well-proportioned hall, Clement opened the door of the drawing-room and looked in. It was empty : an old grand piano, which almost filled one side, was open and strown with music, and there were other signs of recent feminine occupation in the one deep oriel window of the room; but no person was to be seen, and, retiring upon his steps, he made his way to a small apartment, professedly used as a break- fast-room, but in reality given over to the disposal of the younger members of the family. Two girls were thereâ\\x80\\x94Anne and Elsieâ\\x80\\x94at first sight apparently as great a contrast as sisters well could be. There was no marked difference in their height. Anne was, perhaps, an inch the shorter; but she stooped, and Elsie was as straight as a dart, lithe, and carrying her head like a queen. Anne had a round homely face, with irregular features, and no charm about it, but that of a certain frank honesty. Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were large and velvety, her skin was clear, her nose smallUES ELEâ\\x80\\x99S WELCOME. 209 and straight, her mouth and chin delicately cut. The sistersâ\\x80\\x99 hair was of almost the same shade of brown; but while the general impression of Anneâ\\x80\\x99s consisted in the idea that it was arranged in the most unbecoming manner, Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s was loosely twisted up in a fashion which could not have been improved upon by an artist. I.t was the same with their dress. The ma 172 terial was the same, the trimmings exactly similar, and yet the contrast was carried out as thoroughly as in all other points. Clement, intimately as he knew them, could never fail to be struck with it when he saw the two sisters together. There was a little restraint in their manner when they came forward to greet him, as if they were afraid lest something they might say or do would jar upon the grief that had fallen upon him. Anne asked him, nervously, whether he had seen her father. â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know where he is ; but I will try to find him, if you like,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98 Thank you, I have no reason for disturbing him ; I believe I chiefly wanted to see Miss Villars.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And she has driven out with Bella.â\\x80\\x99 * Oh, Clement,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Elsie, unable any longer to keep back the question which she was longing to put, â\\x80\\x98are they come? â\\x80\\x98 Hush, Elsie ! â\\x80\\x99 whispered Anne, looking distressed. â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 answered Mr. Blunt, throwing himself into a basket- chair, â\\x80\\x98they are come. My poor aunt looks dreadfully worn out; I feel certain she ought to see Mr. Ferguson, but whether she will or not is another matter.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And this French young lady ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, a little bitterly, â\\x80\\x98 she is come, too \\' â\\x80\\x98 Have you told her ? What does she say ? â\\x80\\x99 14210 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 She could not very well say much : I suppose she is fully alive to her luck. I should not care, so long as I believed she would â\\x80\\x99 be kind to Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, he was going to add, but prudently forbore to finish his sentence. â\\x80\\x98 The fact is, I imagine, that to see the old place in strangersâ\\x80\\x99 hands must always be hateful, and so one may as well make up oneâ\\x80\\x99s mind to the prospect.â\\x80\\x99 * I hate strangers.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well done, Elsie.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I do, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t care who hears me say so. They are always disagreeable and in the way. At all events, I hope this Miss â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ursule Lafon.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 This Miss Lafon acknowledges that she never saw any place so pretty as Elmwood.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I suspect she gives the palm of beauty to Dieppe.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Then she canâ\\x80\\x99t know anything about it.\\' She must be horrid.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What nonsense ! â\\x80\\x99 put in Anne, impatiently. â\\x80\\x98 Elsie, you are always thinking about things being pretty; so far as that goes, I dare say one place is as good as another.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Anne would not mind if we lived in a country as fiat as this table, with two or three old pollarded elms growing out of the middle of it ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 So long as there were no people,â\\x80\\x99 sighed Anne. â\\x80\\x98I wonâ\\x80\\x99t have you two setting yourselves up against my visitors,â\\x80\\x99 announced Clement, authoritatively. â\\x80\\x98 I mean you to befriend Mademoiselle Lafon, to make her at home here, if she continues to live at the Cottage, and to teach her English.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Does she talk nothing but French ? â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Elsie, in aURSULES WELCOME. 211 tone of horror. â\\x80\\x98Oh, how-dreadful ! how detestable ! I shall keep out of her way.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You can manage better than I can,â\\x80\\x99 said Anne. â\\x80\\x98 I am sure I cannot say three words without a mistake. Clement, I wish she had not come.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Perhaps Bella could talk,â\\x80\\x99 hazarded her sister doubtfully. â\\x80\\x98You are no better than two foolish children. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you see how much you may .improve yourselves?â\\x80\\x99 said their cousin, by way of answer. â\\x80\\x98Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the use?â\\x80\\x99 replied Elsie, wilfully. â\\x80\\x98We donâ\\x80\\x99t mean ever to go abroad, and accents and all the rest of it are no use in scrambling through a French exercise.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98There spake the sagacious Walter.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is quite true.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Quiteâ\\x80\\x94if the worth of a language consists in being able to scramble through its exercises.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Pray do not quarrel with him, Elsie,â\\x80\\x99 said Anne, anxiously. â\\x80\\x98 There is no occasion for your having very much to do with Miss Lafon.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Then you do not acknowledge the duties of hospitality ? â\\x80\\x99 Clement was certainly in a singularly contradictory humour, and more disposed than he had yet been to take Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s part. â\\x80\\x98Yes, I do. What do you mean?â\\x80\\x99 said poor Anne, looking ready to cry. â\\x80\\x98Never mind. I beg your pardon, Anne; I am sure you will be all that is kind ; and, as for Elsie, she has already be 172 stowed her welcome in the shape of her flowers.â\\x80\\x99 1 Oh, she is welcome to everything except my French.â\\x80\\x99 Clement made no answer. Anne went back to the slow and painful copying of a receipt into a manuscript book, and Elsie Itâ\\x80\\x942212 ONE YEAR. took the bit of groundsel from her cousinâ\\x80\\x99s hand, and twisted it in and out between the bars of a canaryâ\\x80\\x99s cage. â\\x80\\x98You have not told us, after all, what she is like,â\\x80\\x99 she said, returning to the subject which occupied all their thoughts. â\\x80\\x98 Not a bit like her brother, poor boy ! His was one of the purest, most spiritualized faces I ever saw. I have seen such a one in a photograph from one of the old Italian masters, but in real life never.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And he is dead. Did she feel it very much ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Did they live alone ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Quite alone, as far as I saw ; at the top of the queerest old house, with an oak staircase that was fit for a palace, and all the rest miserable ! How many more questions am I to answer, Elsie?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Twenty ; and then we will look at poor Anneâ\\x80\\x99s receipt-book, and we shall find neatly copied outâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c To five Miss Lafons add the yolk of three eggs.â\\x80\\x9d Will that be our new pudding, Anne?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I cannot think why cook is so fond of trying new puddings,â\\x80\\x99 said Anne, despairingly. â\\x80\\x98The old ones are much better.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9cYou and Elsie are true conservatives, Anneâ\\x80\\x94puddings, strangers, and all! Well, Elsie, what final demand trembles upon your tongue ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Is she pretty ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I cannot tell; I wish I could. She has a brown face and bright eyes, with hair to match, short and wavy. Is that being pretty ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t sound so. But I am never certain, Clement, how much to believe of your descriptions.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Come and see for yourself to-morrow, then.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Aunt Clare is sure to go.â\\x80\\x99URSULES WELCOME. 213 â\\x80\\x98 And Bella is dying of curiosity.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Is she ? â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Blunt, curtly. He looked so sad, that the sisters did not like to say anything more. Elsie was afraid she had been indiscreet ; and Anne, who was always fearful of hurting peopleâ\\x80\\x99s feelings, stooped more than ever over the table. â\\x80\\x98You have heard nothing about Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s coming, I suppose?* he asked, after a long silence. â\\x80\\x98No ; the last letter said she was too busy to leave London. Mr. Clayton has been ill, and Joyce has a great deal on her hands. It must be dreadful to be in that horrible London all through the summer and autumn ! â\\x80\\x99 Decided likes and dislikes were among the Follaton peculia 172 rities, arising in a great measure from their having lived almost entirely among themselves, and received no modifications of their opinions. It must be fairly conceded that any life differ 172 ing from their own ran a chance of being called horrible, and Clement took no notice of the adjective ; in fact, in this instance he was disposed to endorse it. â\\x80\\x98 I wish she were here,â\\x80\\x99 was all he remarked. â\\x80\\x98 So do I,â\\x80\\x99 answered Elsie, heartily. â\\x80\\x98 Are you going, Clement ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes, if there is no chance of my seeing Miss Villars. But, I say, Anne, I would sooner one of you came to-morrow than Bella. You must not let these nonsensical fancies stand in your way.â\\x80\\x99 Anne looked awkward, twisted her shoulders after an un 172 gainly fashion, and murmured something which was inaudible. Clement treated it as a promise by saying, â\\x80\\x98 Donâ\\x80\\x99t forget,â\\x80\\x99 as he went out of the room, and the two sisters were left alone. â\\x80\\x98 Poor fellow ! he looks wretchedly fagged and ill,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie,214 ONE YEAR. coming over to her sister, and leaning her two hands on the table. â\\x80\\x98Yes; I could not bear to see him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I have no patience with all this unnecessary bother that he has to endure. As if Mrs. Blunt could not have left the Cottage to him, instead of entailing no end of misery and disagreeables ! It is just like her ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Elsie ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is. People have no right to expect their injustice to be praised, because they are dead.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 There is that old story, you know.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 So there is ! Do you know, I had almost forgotten it,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, thoughtfully. â\\x80\\x98 I suppose that does put some romance into the affair.â\\x80\\x99 Anne could not understand romance improving anything ; but she did not answer, because she was taken up with ruefully con 172 templating a large blot in the very middle of her neatly copied receipt. * Oh, dear, I have spoilt it all ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed. â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t see why you should mind,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, mischievously. â\\x80\\x98 I dislike it because it is ugly; but you often say you donâ\\x80\\x99t see any difference.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is not the ugliness, but because it is untidy,â\\x80\\x99 protested Anne. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, well, I suppose order takes the place of beauty in some minds.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And I had resolved to cure myself of that habit of making blots. I wanted very much to have kept this book clean.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Nobody will find fault with you ; thatâ\\x80\\x99s one comfort ! â\\x80\\x99 Anneâ\\x80\\x99s eyes filled with tears. â\\x80\\x98 You donâ\\x80\\x99t really think so ! But then you donâ\\x80\\x99t require it asURSULES WELCOME. 215 I do. I feel continually as if I were going all wrong, and wanted to be picked up and put right again.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Like the dropped stitches in Aunt Clareâ\\x80\\x99s stocking,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, laughing merrily, but at the same time stooping over her sister to give her a hearty kiss. â\\x80\\x98Anne, I believe we poor motherless girls ought to have some indulgence.â\\x80\\x99 Anne shook her head, unwilling to follow Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s flights of imagination. â\\x80\\x98 I wish you were the eldest ! â\\x80\\x99 she said, with a sigh. â\\x80\\x98 As if I did not domineer sufficiently over you without that advantage ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I dare say it is as much that I might escape things as for any other reason,â\\x80\\x99 was Anneâ\\x80\\x99s not very lucid explanation. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, those dreadful dinner-parties ! I never know what to doâ\\x80\\x94 what to say ! and one feels a goose with the other girls talking as if they liked it. I wish people would eat their dinners at home ! If Mrs. Chambers persuades papa into making me go with her to Ordleigh at Christmas, what will become of me ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I never mean to go to parties,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, decidedly. â\\x80\\x98 I should run away in the middle. One daughter is quite enough, and by that time you will have become used to them.â\\x80\\x99 * I donâ\\x80\\x99t think that is possible. Luckily, Bella will enjoy them. â\\x80\\x98Bella! Yes; Bella will enjoy anything in the shape of a show off.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I wonder if it will be good for her? If there were any one from whom Bella would take advice ? She is afraid of papa.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes ; she is afraid of him, and I fearâ\\x80\\x94Anne, do you know, I am sure Bella is not open and honest.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I try not to believe it, butâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. I wish she minded Aunt Clare ! â\\x80\\x992l6 ONE YEAR. 1 Oh, but, then, nobody minds Aunt Clare. Hark ! I hear papa calling. It is you, Anne ; make haste ! â\\x80\\x99 Clement Blunt did not return directly to the Cottage from the Rectory. He went along a narrow path which pierced the shrubberies, and out of a little turnstile gate into the church 172 yard. The grey perpendicular tower, nobly flanked by three fine elms, was the pride of the neighbourhood, and the point of attraction for all travelling antiquaries : those upon whom it had a dearer claim of love believed that nothing could equal St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s tower, in its quiet and solemn beauty. Yet the church itself had fallen into bad repair, and whitewash and high pews reigned triumphantly within. In the churchyard, what beauty there was belonged only to the natural form of the ground, the stately trees, and the little transparent brook which ran directly across it ; for the grave-stones themselves were of the ugliest type, and the grass was coarse and ragged. Clement made his way to a corner where the graves were less crowded, and where, in a vault surrounded with railings, his mother had been laid to rest by the side of her husband and the little ones who had gone early to their Home. He thought of her as a son, and, although his love for her was not that intense affection which he had given to his father, he felt very desolate as he looked down upon her resting-place. She had been fond of him in a fashion ; but her heart had been given to another son, his elder brother, a merry, high-spirited, impetuous boy. He came home from school ill ; the illness turned to fever ; little Clement took the infection, and both were at the point of death. . It really seemed as if Mrs. Blunt, who had almost de 172 manded her favourite boyâ\\x80\\x99s life with all the passionate force of her will, never forgave Clement for having been the one to struggle through the illness while Hugh was taken. There wasURSULE\\'S WELCOME. 2Ã\\x8f7 his name before his brother now, in letters worn away by expo 172 sureâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Hugh Clayton Blunt, aged fourteen.â\\x80\\x99 There was the space where hers would be added to the list. It is possible that the lack of, at all events, outward affection had tended, in some degree, to harden Clement, who possessed a good deal of womanly sensitiveness, and was all the more likely to grow severe. Madam Blunt â\\x80\\x94 as the people about were in the habit of calling her, from some idea of thus marking her French originâ\\x80\\x94never indulged in demonstrations of feeling, or sought sympathy from others. She nursed her sorrows with 172 out allowing them to be shared, even by her son. She became rigid, inflexible, unsparing. She was generous-hearted, and cared not- how freely she gave when the fancy seized her ; but also she was not sufficiently generous to brook the burden of an obligation. To the last she had been the same, and not even the softening influences of sickness and pain had betrayed her into what she called weakness. Her son knew something of this as he stood mournfully looking down. He understood the character of the impulse which led her to act as she had done towards the granddaughter of the old couple who had saved her life. She could not endure to go to the grave feeling as if they had never been repaid ; she would repay them in the person of Ursule, at whatever cost. Clement had always known that he must leave the Cottage, and devote himself to his work ; but he had cherished the hope of returning to it at a future time. He did not blame his mother ; but he felt it hardâ\\x80\\x94the more so from her not having taken him into her confidence, and allowed the news to fall upon him unprepared. It was the old avoidance of sympathy which had pained him throughout his life, and followed him to her very grave. He turned away with a sigh, and walked2l8 ONE YEAR. rapidly back to the Cottage, sore at heart, and, although he would not have acknowledged it, in great need of some com 172 forting and kindly words. Ursule, poring by fire-light over the English words which refused to accommodate themselves to her pronunciation, heard a step in the passage, and a hand upon the lock. But when the hand was withdrawn, and the steps retired, she made up her mind that Mr. Blunt was afraid of finding her in the drawing 172 room, and wished with all her heart that she knew what it was right to do, and that she had remained in her own room. She was correct in her supposition. Clement had entered the house almost mechanically ; but at the door of the drawing-room the idea flashed upon him that he might come upon Ursule en 172 sconced there, and the prospect of a tÃªte-Ã\\xa0-tÃªte was too distasteful to be encountered. He was scarcely, however, better pleased, when he took refuge in his room, to find Sarah unpacking his portmanteau, and resolutely determined upon a delivery of her opinions. â\\x80\\x98 Is my aunt comfortable ? â\\x80\\x99 he inquired. â\\x80\\x98 Sheâ\\x80\\x99s asleep, if thatâ\\x80\\x99s what you mean. Oh, Mr. Clement ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, Sarah?â\\x80\\x99 he said, kindly. She had been a faithful servant for many years, and he felt she deserved consideration. â\\x80\\x98 It canâ\\x80\\x99t be true. My mistress has never left the house to that French girl ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 There was a reason for it, you know. My mother was under an obligation to Mademoiselle Lafonâ\\x80\\x99s family.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 There couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be no right reason for taking it from her own son. For my part, I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe the will would hold.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Hush, Sarah,â\\x80\\x99 said her master, authoritatively; â\\x80\\x98you donâ\\x80\\x99t know what you are saying. My motherâ\\x80\\x99s desire would have been enough for me, without other safeguards. The Cottage was herURSULE\\'S WELCOME. 219 own. She was not a person to do things lightly; and if she desired in this manner to repay some of the debt she owed to the Lagets, she was quite right to do it.â\\x80\\x99 Clementâ\\x80\\x99s manner was such that Sarah was awed. She only ventured to express her irritation by a certain vehemence in the arrangement of his clothes, and by murmuring, under her breath, â\\x80\\x98 A French girl ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Thank you, Sarah,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Blunt, laughing ; â\\x80\\x98 you will perhaps remember that I am half French myself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She canâ\\x80\\x99t speak\\'a word fit to be understood ! â\\x80\\x99 grumbled the old servant, taking no notice. â\\x80\\x98 Donâ\\x80\\x99t you suppose, Mr. Cle 172 ment, that I am going to stay here with her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No one wants you to do what you dislike,â\\x80\\x99 said he, impa 172 tiently ; â\\x80\\x98 but it is impossible for things to settle themselves in twenty-four hours. As yet, my aunt does not even know of either Mademoiselle Lafonâ\\x80\\x99s legacy or her own : nothing is fixed, or thought about. I suppose you donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to go off, and leave us to look after ourselves ? â\\x80\\x99 He spoke irritably, feeling as if this announcement of Sarahâ\\x80\\x99s was the herald of a swarm of annoyances which were likely to come buzzing about his ears, and augured ill for future peace ; and she treated his speech in feminine fashion, by proceeding as if she had not heard it. â\\x80\\x98 A miss like that, with no years to her back, and no head on her shoulders, I â\\x80\\x9911 be bound, to come and put us all about ! Even Jock, poor fellow, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know what to make of it.â\\x80\\x99 Clement could not help smiling; for Sarah and Jock were natural enemies, and this new-born compassion had only sprung up since the old servant considered that a common foe had appeared upon the scene. He took no other notice ; and Sarahâ\\x80\\x99s heart smote her when she saw how weary and troubled220 ONE YEAR. he looked, and how the lines had deepened in his cheeks. Bitter enmity against poor Ursule appeared to her to be the most effectual manner of proving her devotion to her young master, and assuredly, if wishes could have carried Ursule back again to Dieppe, her own and Sarahâ\\x80\\x99s would have solved the dif 172 ficulty of transport at once. Clement did not go down again for the night Ursule escaped to Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s room, lest her presence might be shutting him out from the drawing-room. The wind, which had been blowing all day in occasional violent gusts, had risen, by this time, to a hurricane ; the rain dashed against the little windows, the roar of the sea came over the fields and marshes, and, to add to the noise, the rats evidently held high holiday between the old walls. It was but a cheerless welcome to Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s English home !CHAPTER XIII. THE RECTORY AND ITS WORLD. They used always to say, â\\x80\\x98 We and the world ; â\\x80\\x99 for they imagined them 172 selves to be not only the half of the world, but also by far the better half. The duckling thought it was possible to be of a different opinion ; but that the hen would not allow.â\\x80\\x94The Ugly Duckling. of his friends, who expected that he would end his days as Fellow of St. Peterâ\\x80\\x99s, instead of accepting the first living of which he was offered the refusal, and immediately proceeding to make his hopes and wishes known to the daughter of an old tutor. But, if he disappointed his friendsâ\\x80\\x99 expectations, he made up for it afterwards by proving them to have been un 172 mistakably right in their prognostications that the old life was better suited to him than the new. When little apple-faced Rose was born, his wife died, and her sister had ever since that time lived at the Rectoryâ\\x80\\x94a kindly, soft-eyed woman, whose greatest difficulty lay in the power of decision, even upon the question of whether beef or mutton should furnish the daily dinner. For five years the care and222 ONE YEAR. education of the five motherless children fell upon her ; but at the end of that time Mr. Follaton announced suddenly that Walter would be sent to Marlborough, and that he had engaged a governess for the girls. His family had learned to receive announcements from him without surprise. He was of a singularly abstracted turn of mind, slow to perceive, and utterly impervious to a hint, taken up altogether with books and theological questions, disliking society,and almost childishlysecure in his confidence that matters once rightly set in motion would go on as steadily as the wheels of the church clock at Elmwood, which kept the best time of any clock in the neighbourhood. When, however, his eyes were once opened to the necessity for change, the rector was too conscientious and true-minded to shut them again. He allowed the idea to revolve, slowly, it is true, but it must have been thoroughly, since, without any previous warning, his decision would be issued in a complete and final shape, against which there was no appeal. As has been said, after his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s death, her sister lived with them at the Rectoiyâ\\x80\\x94an arrangement which made Mr. Follaton very content, and five years passed away without the idea of change crossing his mind ; but, at the end of that time, another relation spent a few weeks there, made use of her eyes and ears during the visit, and mentioned her conclusions to Mr. Follaton in very plain terms. Responsibilities to which we do not grow, but are transplanted, are apt to weigh heavily; and the care of these motherless children was fast wearing out Clare Villars, body and mind. She was so anxious about their right training, that she blamed herself for their faults as much as she blamed them, and it was pretty evident the strain was too great. What was to be the remedy ? The rela 172 tion was a wise woman, and she suggested nothing ; she onlyTHE RECTOR Y AND ITS WORLD. delivered herself of her opinions, and left the rector to watch and draw his conclusionsâ\\x80\\x94the result being, that within a monthâ\\x80\\x99s time the changes took place that have been already mentioned. Perhaps the household at the Rectory was more influenced than it knew by the soft, shrinking woman whom every one loved, and yet no one seemed to mind. She had taught her 172 self painfully the routine of economic cares which were neces 172 sary, and nothing was easier than for the cook to prove her mistaken in any point she pleased; nevertheless, there was something in the perfect trust she placed in her servantsâ\\x80\\x99 honesty, in the sorrowful look which saddened her whole face whenever anything was proved against them, which was not without its effect upon the most hardened. Certainly, as one of the number remarked, there was no pleasure in deceiving Miss Villars. And, although Clement smiled at his own fancy in supposing she could be of service, it was for her coming that, on the day following their arrival at Elmwood, he looked and longed impatiently. Everything appeared to him to be in a singular transition state. For himself, he could not so much as read the news 172 paper with any degree of attention, his mind was in so restless and feverish a condition. The old familiar things looked strangely at him, as if aware they were no longer his. He avoided the rooms, lest Ursule should be in them : the touch of the stranger was over all. And the interview with his aunt must be gone through on this day : he should hear what she wished to do; he must prepare for wounded feeling and re 172 proaches, and break gently to her what had not so much as crossed her mind. Sarah walked about the house dusting the chintzes in a reproachful manner, and continually expressing in her face that she had never expected such a blow to fall upon22 4 ONE YEAR. her. It certainly was hard that he who was the chief sufferer should have everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s burden to bear. â\\x80\\x98 Presently, I sup 172 pose,â\\x80\\x99 said poor Clement, bitterly, â\\x80\\x98 I shall have to arrange who is to live here with that girl, and what she is to pay her cook and housemaid ! â\\x80\\x99 Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny did not come down-stairs. She made Ursule pull about the furniture in her room, and alter it to her liking; and then she got up and dressed herself in a strange figured dressing-gown, and lay upon a little sofa at the foot of the bed, with all her grey curls arranged in order under\\'her cap, in case visitors should come to see her, as she hoped with all her heart would be the case. Perhaps it was fortunate that she disliked Sarah, and pronounced her face too melancholy to be endured, since the old servantâ\\x80\\x99s good offices were not likely to be rendered with any alacrity. Madame was not unkind to Ursule. If she remained at the Cottage, as she reflected, it would be very desirable to have some one to pass away the time for her during her nephewâ\\x80\\x99s daily absences at Defforton ; and it would not do for Ursule to take it into her head to return to Dieppeâ\\x80\\x94 certainly not as yet, at all events. So she graciously permitted her to sit and talk over her first impressions of the place, and her wonder at there being nothing straight about the house, with its steps, and back staircases, and crooked passages. â\\x80\\x98What is one to do, Madame?â\\x80\\x99 she asked, a little hope 172 lessly. â\\x80\\x98 At the farm-house there were cheeses to make.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Child, do not talk so imprudently ! Plere you are to live the life of a lady, not of a farmerâ\\x80\\x99s daughter.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But ladies must do something,â\\x80\\x99 persisted Ursule. â\\x80\\x98 Is it per 172 mitted to go to market?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I do not know. I imagine soâ\\x80\\x94there can be nothing deroga 172 tory in that ; but I will ask my nephew. He has sent up to in-THE RECTORY AND ITS WORLD. quire at what hour I shall be visible, and I have fixed twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock.â\\x80\\x99 Poor Madame always said â\\x80\\x98 my nephew â\\x80\\x99 with a sort of pride : it was very new to her to feel the ties of relationship. â\\x80\\x98 Ursule ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Madame ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 That picture opposite to me, over the fire-place, who is it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The old lady with the bright eye and grey hair ? Is it not a little like you? It must be your sister.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 FÃ©licitÃ© ? FÃ©licitÃ© like that ! Bah ! of what are you think 172 ing ? FÃ©licitÃ© was upright and smooth-skinned, with hair darker than yours. What foolishness to suppose that old woman to be FÃ©licitÃ©, who was not so many years older than I am ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How should I know?â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, soothingly. â\\x80\\x98Very likely it is some relation of Monsieur Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s father.â\\x80\\x99 Madamedidnot answer; but she watched thepicture earnestly, with a wistful look upon her shrunken face, until she sighed and turned away her head. It was indeed a likeness of Madam Blunt ; but Ursule never heard her allude again to the subject. Presently she recommenced. â\\x80\\x98 Ursule ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Madame ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What can be seen from my window ? â\\x80\\x98 First of all the little garden, then the road, then fields and an orchard, and a bit of the railway, and the beautiful sea. Oh, there is a great deal ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 A great deal, child ! What is there in all that ? I mean, what is there to see, to distract ? What passes in the road ? â\\x80\\x99 Ursule was obliged to confess that a cart and a flock of sheep were all that had come under her notice, and Madame sighed again. 1522Ã\\x93 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 This England is very triste,â\\x80\\x99 she said, shivering ; then, sud 172 denly brightening, told the girl that she might go, for she heard her nephew in the passage; and Ursule, guessing his errand, was only too ready to escape, and, tying a light hood over her head, ran out into the garden. Madame greeted her nephew as warmly as if she had been left in solitude all the morning, which, it crossed his mind, had probably been the case. No one could have been more kind and gentle towards her than he. He felt the greatest pity for what she had been called upon to do, and as if he ought to think no sacrifice too great which could soften the trial to her. He spoke of his mother, of her desire to see her sister once more, so that her wishes became imperative ; and he dwelt as long as he could upon this fact, which evidently gratified his aunt. And then he went on to touch upon Ursuleâ\\x80\\x94his mo 172 therâ\\x80\\x99s delight when her prompt conjecture proved to be trueâ\\x80\\x94 her eagerness to see the girlâ\\x80\\x94her strong anxiety to repay, in some measure, the debt of gratitude she owed to the old Lagets. Madame listened with attention. â\\x80\\x98 Well, my dear Clement, you will probably have no objection to her remaining here with us? My comfort requires some one ; it would be a convenience to me, and a provision for her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am afraid,â\\x80\\x99 said her nephew, gravely, â\\x80\\x98 that the arrange 172 ment of who shall live in this house does not depend upon either you or me. Mademoiselle Lafon is the sole person to be con 172 sulted.â\\x80\\x99 * Ursule?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Precisely so.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Clement,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, nervously tapping the side of the sofa, â\\x80\\x98 you are talking riddles ; and I hate riddles. What has Ursule to do with this house ? â\\x80\\x99THE RECTOR Y AND ITS WORLD. â\\x80\\x98 It is her own.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Her own ? Bah ! you are a drollâ\\x80\\x94you jest ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am in no jesting humour. I repeat, the Cottage and, what is more, four thousand pounds were left by my mother to Ursule Lafon.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Four thousand pounds ! â\\x80\\x99 Clement nodded. Madameâ\\x80\\x99s colour changed ; but, to his amazement and relief, she broke into no invectives. It seemed as if, with her, FÃ©licitÃ©â\\x80\\x99s will was not to be resistedâ\\x80\\x94even in the grave. She received the news with a touch of quiet dignity which he had not expected, and for which he was really grate 172 ful. She was pleased to hear of her own legacy, and then said calmly, â\\x80\\x98 After all, this will make no difference ; we shall all be to 172 gether here.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Mademoiselle Ursule may have many words to say to such an arrangement.â\\x80\\x99 * Nonsense! she is but a child; she must do what I bid her.â\\x80\\x99 A remembrance of the many times Ursule had resisted her at 172 tempts at authority rose up and troubled Madame at that moment. But things were different now, and she was far more amenable and gentle. Of course she would do as Madame directed. â\\x80\\x98Fetch her here,â\\x80\\x99 she said aloud: â\\x80\\x98all this can be settled at once.â\\x80\\x99 So Clement had to go in search of Ursule, whom he found in the garden, with her attention divided between a bunch of grapes and her little phrase-book. She looked reluctant to go in, when he explained that he had been sent to fetch her. â\\x80\\x98 Is she angry?â\\x80\\x99 she asked, with the shrinking she felt whenever the idea crossed her mind that these things were actually her own. 15â\\x80\\x942228 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98Not at all,â\\x80\\x99 answered Clement; â\\x80\\x98but it seems to me that I ought to give you warning. My aunt may talk as if she con 172 sidered it proper that you should yield your will to hers, and act in this matter in the manner she has decided to be best. Now, it is right that you should be perfectly uninfluenced, and I particularly desire that you should not hastily consent to ar 172 rangements of any kind whatever until you have consulted the trustees my mother appointed.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Why, you are a lawyer yourself, Monsieur,â\\x80\\x99 said she, looking up with a smile. â\\x80\\x98 I will leave everything in your hands.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 That is exactly what I do not wish you to do,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, with some irritation. â\\x80\\x98 I am the last person who should have anything to do with the matter. I wish you to act entirely in 172 dependently of my aunt and me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I wish â\\x80\\x99 began Ursule, abruptly ; then she paused, and went on hurriedly, â\\x80\\x98 Do not think me ungrateful, Monsieur, for your motherâ\\x80\\x99s goodnessâ\\x80\\x94I shall never cease to love her for it ; but I cannot help wishing that she had not given your pretty house to me. If she had but sent me a message of friendship, and you or Madame had the rest â\\x80\\x99 She looked in his face as she spoke, with an expression so beseeching and humble that his feelings were touched with a sense of past injustice. It shamed him to think that he was visiting his own vexation upon this innocent girl, herself almost unprotected in a land of strangers. It was not the loss of fortune or the value of the land that he begrudgedâ\\x80\\x94to all this she was welcome enough ; it was the old home, the home of his boyhood, which he could not bear to think had passed out of his hands for ever ; and it was the want of confidence which pre 172 vented his mother telling him of her intentions that galled himTHE RECTOR Y AND ITS WORLD. most of all. When he answered Ursule, it was more kindly than he had ever spoken to her before. â\\x80\\x98 I can quite understand,â\\x80\\x99 he said : â\\x80\\x98 it must be a burden to you, and I am afraid none of us are very kind in trying to make it otherwise. But you will think differently by-and-bye ; and, believe me, it is well that you have independent persons to look after your interests. I will write a note to Mr. Gray or Mr. Ross, and ask one of them to come out from Defforton by an early train to-morrow. They are persons whom my mother altogether trusted.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Thank you,â\\x80\\x99 in a grateful tone, was all that Ursule could say before they reached the door of Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s room. But even there, with his hand on the lock, Mr. Blunt paused. â\\x80\\x98 Remember,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98 you must make no promises until you have seen Mr. Gray. You understand, do you not ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But yes, perfectly ; â\\x80\\x99 and they entered the room. â\\x80\\x98You have heard, Ursule? I hope you are sufficiently alive to my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s bounty. It was, indeed, a fortunate thing for you that I inhabited the premier of the Sansonsâ\\x80\\x99 house,â\\x80\\x99 began Madame at once. â\\x80\\x98Yes, Madame,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, simply, though a little smile flickered about the corners of her mouth. â\\x80\\x98 And I have done my best to instruct you to conduct your 172 self in a comme-il-faui manner.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, Madame.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I shall still continue to instruct you. Of course, this will make no difference. You will reside here : there is nothing to take you back to France ; and I and my nephew shall reside with you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Of course, Madame.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Stop ! â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, eagerly ; â\\x80\\x98 nothing of the sort must be23Â° ONE YEAR. agreed upon. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x94Mademoiselle, you have already pro 172 mised to engage yourself to nothing until you have taken advice.â\\x80\\x99 She looked at him with astonished eyes. â\\x80\\x98You did not mean that/â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98Why, it is simply a matter of course. What else could there be ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Hold your tongue, Clement,â\\x80\\x99 said his aunt, for the first time speaking irritably to him. â\\x80\\x98 It is, as she says, a finished affair. Go away, and let me talk with Ursule.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Mademoiselle, I shall not permit you to bind yourself to any course of action. You are to consult your trustees.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Not upon Madameâ\\x80\\x99s living here ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Upon everything which concerns your arrangements.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Of what are you thinking, Monsieur ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Ursule, indignantly, turning round with flashing eyes ; â\\x80\\x98 of what do you believe me capable ? Is it possible that I should have the base 172 ness, the wickedness, to refuse a home to Madame, when it is her own sister who has put it into my power to offer it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Wait, I say, until you have seen the trustees,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, pacing up and down the room with perturbed steps. â\\x80\\x98 I will not wait. Why should I wait ? No one shall judge for me in such a matter as this. Madame,â\\x80\\x99 continued Ursule, kneeling by her side, and taking the wasted hand in her own, â\\x80\\x98 you understand me better ; you know that soonerâ\\x80\\x94a thousand times soonerâ\\x80\\x94than that you should go away from here, I would return to Dieppe, and not accept a sou of this hateful money. I would far rather do so now,â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, trembling with excitement, and looking angrily at Clement. â\\x80\\x98 You are a good girl, Ursule,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, touched by her warmth of tone, * you have a good heart ; and my nephew only speaks as these men always speak,â\\x80\\x99 she added, contemptuously. â\\x80\\x98 Certainly, I will remain with you, and Clement also.â\\x80\\x99THE RECTORY AND ITS WORLD. â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said the latter, standing before the window and looking out; â\\x80\\x98my home will for the future be in Defforton. It must have been so, whoever had the Cottage,â\\x80\\x99 he said, as Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny made an exclamation of remonstrance. â\\x80\\x98 You are not going to separate yourself from me ? â\\x80\\x99 she said, reproachfully. â\\x80\\x98 My dear aunt, I must work, and that a little harder than I have hitherto done. I have lived here for my motherâ\\x80\\x99s sake ; now the time is come when I must throw myself into the business more completely. I am ready to offer you such a home as I can furnish in the town â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is impossible for me to move again,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, with petulance. â\\x80\\x98Madame remains here,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, defiantly. Clement glancing at her, half vexed and half amused at her persistency, was struck with the beauty of her face, consisting more in expression than in feature, and now lit up with the glow of warm feeling. Colour had flushed her brown cheek; her eye sparkled ; she looked like a small heroine as she stood by Madameâ\\x80\\x99s side, drawn up to her full height. He acknow 172 ledged to himself that he liked her all the better for her valour and constancy ; and yet he was provoked at the failure of his precautionsâ\\x80\\x94-at the notion that his aunt willingly allowed herself to be dependent upon her. But he smiled very kindly as he said, â\\x80\\x98 You are a good friend, Mademoiselle Ursule !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Bah ! what a fuss you both make ! â\\x80\\x99 said Madame. â\\x80\\x98 There is nothing else to be done, that I can see ; that is, provided I arrange to stay here. Still, Clement, I wish that you would re 172 consider your decision. It will be unbearably triste in this absolute country without you. Who are your neighboursâ\\x80\\x94 your society ? â\\x80\\x99232 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 There are my cousins at the Rectoryâ\\x80\\x94plenty of them ; there are Mr. and Mrs. Chambers, living at the Hall, about three quarters of a mile off; there is the doctor, Mr. Ferguson, and the Miss Rosewardens, andâ\\x80\\x94those are all I can think of just now.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And in the townâ\\x80\\x94this town you speak of? But it is no use ; it is impossible for me to move : this pain in my back will drive me distracted.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I wish I could do anything for you,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, much concerned. â\\x80\\x98 Nothingâ\\x80\\x94nothing ! Ursule, can you not teach yourself to stand still ? Every movement goes through me.â\\x80\\x99 When these fits of nervous irritability came on, the more quiet she was kept the better. Clement stole out of the room, determined to bring Dr. Ferguson to the rescue before the day was over, and inclined, for the first time, to pity Ursule for the constant strain upon her forbearance. â\\x80\\x98 I like her for speaking out heartily, just now,â\\x80\\x99 he thought to himself. â\\x80\\x98 There must be some good in her. She canâ\\x80\\x99t be utterly frivolous and selfish, or she would have been glad to have rid herself of the burden ; but noâ\\x80\\x94she showed no signs of it, at all events. What on earth will become of her here ? â\\x80\\x99 When luncheon was announced, he sent notice to Ursule ; and Sarah returned, labouring with indignation at the difficulty of understanding what either said, but, as far as she could tell, the young Frenchwoman wanted to have her dinner up there with Madame. â\\x80\\x98 Nasty foreign ways ! â\\x80\\x99 formed her commentary. In the afternoon came Miss Villars, Elsie, and with them, in spite of Clementâ\\x80\\x99s injunction, Bella. Elsie walked in, looking shy and uncomfortable, until she had glanced round the room, and became aware that no enemy was there in the form of aTHE RECTOR Y AND ITS WORLD. stranger. Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s countenance, on the contrary, sank, when she had even more rapidly made the reconnoissance. She was a tall, womanly-looking girl, fair-haired and light-eyed ; but the eyes, though pretty in colour, were set too closely together for beauty, and there was, even to a casual observer, a want of the frank-hearted openness which proclaimed itself in her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s face. To strangers, however, her manner was far more pleasing ; she was free from Anneâ\\x80\\x99s awkwardness and Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s brusquerie, and she possessed, to a rare degree, either tact or what passed for it in society. Miss Villars was a tall, drooping, graceful-looking woman, with a sweet gentle smile and a shrinking, almost painful, ner 172 vousness of manner, which made her falter and hesitate when she so much as heard her own unsupported voice. She was one of those women whose hardest task it seems to be to stand alone in the world, obliged to decide and act upon their own responsibilities. In her case the care of the large household at the Rectory was a burden which only the most conscientious feeling of duty could have induced her to undertake. She had not the smallest love of power in her disposition. No one knew what it cost her to give a reprimand, and no offender suffered so much from the rebuke or dismissal as Miss Villars herself. And although, whatever the pain to herself, she was too right-minded to avoid what she had made up her mind it was her duty to do, she was also of so transparent and guileless a mind, so ready to believe good, so prompt with her own excuses for the offender, that many a wrong dealing was never brought to light, and many a sinner avoided punishment. Yet it was to her, with her ready sympathetic charity, that Clement, in the midst of his doubts and annoyances, turned with no little relief.234 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Thank you, with all my heart, for coming, Miss Villars.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It must be terribly dreary for you,â\\x80\\x99 said she, holding out both hands to him, with her soft eyes full of tears. â\\x80\\x98 It is all very strange. I scarcely know myself or the house. But I want to enlist your kindness on behalf of my two new- comers, who lie heavy on my mind. It has been a severe blow for my poor old aunt to leave her country at her time of life, andâ\\x80\\x94to meet with this shock after all. Here she seems to be cast away ; everything is strangeâ\\x80\\x94mode of life, food, people. I pity her with all my heart. I cannot see how she is to avoid being miserable. And she is in great suffering, to add to it all. Miss Villars, what is to be done ? â\\x80\\x99 Clement smiled to himself, the instant he had put the question, at having supposed it possible for Miss Villars to give advice ; and yet there was some degree of comfort in her â\\x80\\x98 Poor thing, how very sad for her ! â\\x80\\x99 because it said, plainly, how gladly she would help him, if she could. â\\x80\\x98 There has been this complication about the house to increase our difficulties,â\\x80\\x99 he said, continuing to pour out his troubles : â\\x80\\x98 I had thought that my aunt could live with me at Defforton ; but she seems to think it impossible for her to undertake another remove, and I believe, indeed, that she is quite unfit for it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But,â\\x80\\x99 suggested Miss Villars, with hesitation, â\\x80\\x98 surely it will be happier for Mademoiselle Lafon to keep Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny with herâ\\x80\\x94that is, supposing she lives at the Cottage.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You think so, do you?â\\x80\\x99 asked Clement, eagerly. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x94I am no judge, but I should have thought so. She is very young, poor child, is she not ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But do you think it right that she should undertake such a burden as the care of my aunt must be, when there is no real tie?â\\x80\\x99THE RECTORY AND ITS WORLD. â\\x80\\x98 It seems to me as if circumstances had formed the tie. And Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny must have been very kind to her ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes/ said Clement, doubtfully. He was less sure of this fact than formerly. â\\x80\\x98 Then she will like to do all she can to show her gratitude/ said Miss Villars, warmly. â\\x80\\x98 Having no mother, poor thing, it will be so pleasant for her to feel she is not quite alone.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Mademoiselle Lafon is going to stay at Elmwood, is she not, Clement ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Bella, who had pretended to be absorbed in looking through a photograph-book, but had not missed a single word of the conversation. â\\x80\\x98 I believe so/ â\\x80\\x98 I am very glad.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I am very sorry/ bluntly said Elsie, who had also heard everything, only took no pains to hide her interest. â\\x80\\x98 Sorry ! Elsie, my dear child ! â\\x80\\x99 gently remonstrated Miss Villars. â\\x80\\x98 Sorry ! How unkind you are ! â\\x80\\x99 This from Bella. â\\x80\\x98Yes, I am sorry/ persisted Elsie. â\\x80\\x98I am certain we shall never suit ; she will not like our ways, nor we hers. I dare say she will give herself airs and graces ; but, whether she does or not, we donâ\\x80\\x99t want new people. One never knows what to say to them.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Elsie is thinking about her French genders/ said Bella, excusingly. â\\x80\\x98Well, they do make it worse/ her sister said, good- humouredly. â\\x80\\x98 My dearâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 began Miss Villars ; but she hesitated, and Bella broke in, in her quiet voice, â\\x80\\x98Do you like Mademoiselle Lafon, Clement?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I ? â\\x80\\x99 he answered, taken aback by the question. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x94I236 ONE YEAR. hardly know her yet. Yes; indeed, I think there is a great deal to like in her : she is behaving very well in this business.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I hope we shall see her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Nonsense, Bella!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Elsie. â\\x80\\x98What is the use of worrying her now, when there will be a hundred other oppor 172 tunities ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But I want you to see her ; I want her to feel not utterly friendless,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement. â\\x80\\x98 It seems to me that we have each our own affairs to look after, and she is the most desolate of all. Elsie, put those very fierce opinions of yours out of sight, if you please, or you will frighten her from Elmwood for ever. Miss Villars, will you come up-stairs and be introduced to my aunt ? Then Mademoiselle Lafon will probably consent to make acquaintance with Elsie and Bella.â\\x80\\x99 Miss Villars, with a heightened colour, followed him out of the room. The meeting with the old French lady was to her, if possible, a more formidable affair than it would have been to Elsie, and she felt far more unequal to the task of making her 172 self understood in a strange language. Clement would have pitied her if he had known how her limbs trembled, and what an effort it was for her to follow him into the room where Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny lay on the sofa in all the grandeur of her flowered dressing-gown ; and Ursule, sitting on the window- seat, read aloud in a monotonous voice, which she had proved to be the best way of soothing her in moments of irritation. She stood quietly by while Madame was making an elaborate little speech to express the pleasure she felt at receiving a visit from Miss Villars. When her own turn came, the latter caught a wistful look as if she was pleading for kindness, and her good heart went out to the girl at once. But she was too shy to ex 172 press anything ; she shook hands with her tremulously, andTHE RECTOR Y AND ITS WORLD then Clement asked Ursule to go into the drawing-room and entertain his cousins. Two pair of eager eyes fastened themselves upon her as she came into the room, perfectly quiet and self-possessed, and ready, with French pliability, to adapt herself to those she came to see, although all the while in the background there was no little curiosity about the details of a life and society to which, even in her own country, she was a stranger. No one, how 172 ever, could have failed to be daunted by the frigidity of Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s manner. It was not any intentional unkindness, in spite of what she had said before Clement, but it was a most unpleasant armour of prickly points which her shyness invariably presented to a stranger, heightened tenfold in the present case by the horror of being obliged to express herself in a strange language. Poor Ursule, finding an impenetrable barrier of â\\x80\\x98 Oui\\' and â\\x80\\x98Non â\\x80\\x99 the only replies she could elicit, began to wonder whether she was understood at all, whether English young ladies always sucked the handles of their parasols, as Bella was doing now, or whether it was not comme il faut to introduce topics of con 172 versation. In spite of Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s pretty face, Bella looked the most hopeful of the two, or, at all events, the least inclined to get up and run away ; but her utmost endeavours produced very little effect. She found it was of so little use to ask ques 172 tions when the reply was exhausted in a monosyllable, that in despair she fell back upon a description of their sea-voyage and her own miseries, told in language so sparkling and bright that any one who followed her meaning could not have failed to be amused. But, although Elsie could have understood it well enough had she read it, she was too shy and bewildered to re 172 cognize the charm in Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s rapid language, and too honest to pretend, like Bella, that she derived any enjoyment from the238 ONE YEAR. account. She sat, looking as uncomfortably icy as ever : while Bella, who was anxious to create a favourable impression, smiled and nodded, and even attempted longer answers, speak 172 ing correctly enough in all but accent, and encouraged by Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s ready perception of her meaning to plunge into bolder depths. Nothing could have been prettier, if Elsie only would have allowed it, than the tact and graciousness of the French manner ; but partly a persistent contempt for anything foreign, partly a genuine horror of strangers, prevented her from admiring it, or giving way to the least cordiality. Only a wish to do as Clement desired, just at this time when he had much to trouble him, added to Anneâ\\x80\\x99s earnest entreaty that she might be spared the first introduction, induced her to accompany Miss Villars to the Cottage ; and now she sat, looking the picture of misery, longing for the time of escape, and presenting no very en 172 couraging prospect to poor Ursule as a specimen of the young English ladies with whom she must look forward to come into contact. The conversationâ\\x80\\x94if such it could be calledâ\\x80\\x94arrived at a depressing pitch. Having exhausted the voyage, there was very little remaining to Ursule. Home and the antipodes might have had more ideas in common than these girls, divided only by a narrow sea-channel and the difference of language. There seemed to be a void of anything to communicate; and Elsie could look nothing but hostile, as if Ursule were an interloper, and consequently, an offender of the deepest dye. Clement took in the position with a rapid and amused glance, when he brought Miss Villars down-stairs, and Elsie rose with delight that her penance was at an end. Ursule, on her part, watched with some amazement the girlsâ\\x80\\x99 unreserved and frank manner with their cousin, and was grateful to MissTHE RECTORY AND ITS WORLD. 239 Villars for the kindly way in which she took her hand and tried to frame a little speech of invitation to the Rectory.

Mr. Blunt walked back to the Rectory with his cousins. Ursule put on her bonnet, and stole out of the house across the fields towards the sea. She thought it would seem like an old friend ; but whether it was fancy, or whether the state of the clouds made a difference, certain it was that it looked, as she pro 172 nounced it, cold and gloomy, and as unlike as possible to the big, blustering waves of her own Dieppe.CHAPTER XIV. SHUT OUT. Harae, hame, hame, fain wad I be Hame, hame, hame, in my am countrie. Scotch Song. GRAY came and went. He had a long consulta- on with Clement on his way from the station, and sed his instructions by setting before Ursule, in ch he could command, what would be her position, and what she undertook in her stanch invitation to Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny. She listened politely, and was grateful to him for the pains he took to put everything clearly before her. But she never wavered in her determination. The house, and all that she had, were at Madameâ\\x80\\x99s service. That was the little phrase she repeated over and over again, rather proud of its comprehensiveness, and in no way shaken by all the arguments which the lawyer thought it necessary to bring forward. Clement could do no more than fix a certain sum to be paid towards Ma 172 dameâ\\x80\\x99s maintenance, as much as he could afford in addition to a little of her own ; and Mr. Gray took his leave, wondering in no small degree how Ursule and Madame between them would the best FiSHUT OUT. 241 make their way in an atmosphere so entirely strange as the society at Elmwood. Clement himself was glad to go. It was painful to him to remain in a house no longer his own, which yet could never seem otherwise. Then, with his aunt up-stairs, his presence necessarily deprived Ursule of a great deal of freedom : the household was divided into two, and discomfort was the result. Sarah had made up her mind to go with him to Defforton ; and when she found that he would live in lodgings, and required no servant, her disappointment was bitter. Between the dislike of change and the misery of altogether forsaking the family, she determined to remain at the Cottage; and Ursule, im 172 pressed by Clement with an idea of her value, and supposing that disagreeable manners might be the distinctive character of all English servants, gladly accepted her service. Indeed, poor child, it was a relief at this time, whenever she could, to fall back upon doing what she was told. Never had she felt so desolate, so inexperienced. Clement knew not what to advise. He did not approve of Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s holding despoti 172 cally the reins of power ; he had a lurking fear that she might tyrannize over Ursule ; at all events, it was placing the latter in a false position. But, then, the other alternative ? Putting her eighteen years out of the question, the very routine of an En 172 glish household was as different as anything well could be from the easy, informal life to which she had been accustomed. And Sarah would spare her nothing. Ursule had prudently resolved to accommodate herself entirely to the customs of the country ; but it must be owned she tried hard to evade the necessity of sitting down to solitary meals, especially to the unknown insti 172 tution of breakfast, with its elaborate comfort. She gave way, however, before Sarahâ\\x80\\x99s unflinching resolution that what had 16242 ONE YEAR. always been should always be ; and while she took care that Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny had her usual cup of coffee or chocolate in her bed-â\\x80\\x94making it herself, indeed, until she discovered that Madam Blunt had tutored the old servant in its preparation after the foreign fashionâ\\x80\\x94Ursule herself, with a sinking heart, descended into the gloomy dining-room, and submitted to her melancholy meal. The morning â\\x80\\x98 orders â\\x80\\x99 were a heavy trial ; scarcely less so the result of the orders, in the joints which actually made her dread dinner, and the unfailing surety of hearing Madame descant in no measured terms upon the un- savouriness of her food. Ursule would have liked to run into the kitchen, and prepare little things herself ; but she dared not venture, while she feared to displease Mr. Blunt, by offending Sarah or the cook. ^ Sheer necessity was obliging her to make progress with En 172 glish, so that she contrived to be understood. She committed, it is true, a hundred mistakes, some of them of consequence ; and Sarah had a grim satisfaction in insisting that each one should be brought to her notice. Ursule was young, and natu 172 rally buoyant-hearted. Sometimes the ludicrous side of her position struck her so prominently, that she would break into a peal of merry laughter. But it requires a large stock of phi 172 losophy to laugh very frequently when you must laugh alone. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s spirits were more than commonly vari 172 able. There were times, especially after a visit from Miss Villars or from Clementâ\\x80\\x94who intended to make it a rule to devote his Saturday afternoons to the Cottageâ\\x80\\x94when she was bright, and apparently happy. Fortunately, too, she liked her doctor, and gathered little morsels of local news from him, told in villanous French, but full of fascination to Madame. She was far beyond Ursule in her knowledge of the surroundingSHUT OUT. 243 neighbours. But, to compensate for these cheerful moments, there were long, long hours of pain and fretfulness, and bitter reproaches of Ursule for having not only dragged her to Eng 172 land, but induced her to remain. Sometimes the girlâ\\x80\\x99s patience gave way, and she answered angrily ; more often her gentleness did not fail until she had soothed the poor irritable invalid into calmness, or even into a tardy acknowledgment of her merits as a companion. Perhaps an English girl in her position would have been more oppressed with the dread of offending against the laws of society than was Ursule. She felt utterly ignorant of them ; but she had too little self-consciousness to be troubled with fears of not ac 172 quitting herself fairly when the occasion came. Meanwhile, so little did she seek it, that she did not even think of returning the Rectory visit, until, one morning, Miss Villars, finding her sitting with Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, and pitying the pale face which told of some hoursâ\\x80\\x99 confinement to the sick-room, entreated her to go there, and to desire the servant to show her into the young ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 room at once. If a griffin had suddenly been introduced by the housemaid, greater consternation could hardly have been produced ! The girls were reading with Miss Smith, the governess : Anne, stiff and awkward, her plain, good-tempered face knitted into an expression of weary, conscientious, unenjoyable study; little Rose next to her, travelling through a copy, and rather enter 172 taining herself with an accumulation of more and more oddly shaped blots ; Elsie sitting with both elbows on the table, her fingers twisted into her brown hair, her eyes riveted on the book, of which page after page was turned over without regard to the whereabouts of the reader, who happened to be Bella. It is true that, at this moment, it required patience to listen to 16â\\x80\\x942244 ONE YEAR. Bella with any amount of attention. She had been annoyed by a remark of gentle patient little Miss Smith, and gabbled on with a total disregard of sense, treating Carthaginians and Ro 172 mans, friends and foes, alike, as no better than impediments in her steeple-chase career. â\\x80\\x98 After some time had been spent in exercising the rowers on shipboard, the fleet put to sea, and went in quest of the enemy, the consul Duillius â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My dear ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is Duillius, Miss Smith.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But he was not the enemy. â\\x80\\x98 You did not let me finish the sentence.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you paid any attention to the stops. Do you not see that a sentence is concluded ?â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Smith, timidly, and dreading an altercation with Bella. â\\x80\\x98 One might be all day about it, if one waited to count four at every full stop ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I like Rose to understand, and she cannot do so unless you read more carefully.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Rose only spoils her copy when she attempts two things at once.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, pray, Bella, donâ\\x80\\x99t begin to argue ! â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, im 172 patiently. â\\x80\\x98 Why canâ\\x80\\x99t you just do what you are told ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Miss Lafon,â\\x80\\x99 announced Hannah, the housemaid. There was a general start of dismay. Elsie pushed back her chair; Bella composed her features into a smile; Rose allowed her pen to rest on the paper, and produce the finest round blot of the series, while she stared open-mouthed at the new-comer. Miss Smith rose, and Anne followed her example, looking, as she felt, more than usually wretched and ungainly. As for poor Ursule herself, she stood for a moment in the doorway readingSHUT OUT. 245 no welcome in any 01 the faces before her, and scarcely liking to advance further. But Miss Smith recovered herself suffi 172 ciently to put out her hand, and to go through the conventional greeting ; and Ursule explained rapidly that she only obeyed Miss Villars in intruding upon them as she had done. â\\x80\\x98 Poor thing ! â\\x80\\x99 thought the governess, â\\x80\\x98 she looks very young to be so lonely.â\\x80\\x99 For the only glimpse the Rectory party, as a body, had yet caught of her was in the high pew at St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s. To come upon us in the morning ! This is intolerable ! â\\x80\\x99 was Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s comment. Anne felt her tongue glued to the roof of her mouth. It was very hard to be civil to people in English ; in French it seemed an absolute impossibility. As for Bella, she, as usual, came to the rescue. She brought forward a chair, swept Roseâ\\x80\\x99s inky copy-book out of sight, and plunged at once into the inquiry of how Ursule liked Elmwood. Elsie could understand her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s question better than the quick answer, but jealousy for Elmwood superiority made her do her best to gather its drift. â\\x80\\x98 It is all strange to me, and a little sad, since poor Madame is so suffering. Without doubt, it must be a charming place,â\\x80\\x99 added Ursule, with national politeness. â\\x80\\x98Anne and Elsie think it the most beautiful spot in the world.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And you also ? â\\x80\\x99 Ursule asked, a little amused. â\\x80\\x98 No, indeed. I like a place where there is something to see.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah, I comprehend ! â\\x80\\x99 was the eager answer. And then it came out, to Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s great indignation, that Ursule thought there were too many trees at Elmwood, and that they made her feel oppressed and shut in. That was the only thing wanting to fill up the measure of her246 ONE YEAR. unpopularity. That a stranger, who could not even speak English, should venture to criticise the Elmwood trees was a height of presumption that was absolutely intolerable ! â\\x80\\x98 What does she come here for, if she knows no better than that?â\\x80\\x99 thought Elsie, fiercely. â\\x80\\x98The idea of poor Clement being obliged to give up his home for a foreigner ! â\\x80\\x99 reflected Anne. And yet they were not ill-natured girls. They would have been shocked willingly to inflict pain. They would have grudged no trouble for one of their own family or belongings. But they measured every one by their own standard. They lived so completely among themselves, that they had grown to believe that all outside the circle was inferior to it ; circumstances had never taught them to modify the harsh judgments which are especially the snare of the young. Taken individually, they were humble-minded about themselves, Anne and Elsie. They were aware of their own faults, and honestly tried to improve : as to accomplishments, although they were not very ready to acknowledge their necessity, they thoroughly understood them 172 selves to be rather deficient than otherwise in each. * But as a familyâ\\x80\\x94as Elmwoodâ\\x80\\x94they were invulnerable in their self- respect, and anything unknown and unproved was looked upon with suspicion and dislike. â\\x80\\x98What do I think of they new folks ? â\\x80\\x99 old Betty Simmonds, who lived in the cottage next to the Rectory, had said. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m not going to think nothing about them till Iâ\\x80\\x99ve summered and wintered them.â\\x80\\x99 That was the Elmwood principle speaking out ; and it will be readily under 172 stood that poor Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s chances of welcome were not many. She sighed a little as she looked round upon the fresh young faces which had small kindness or sympathy in them for her. She would have so greatly liked to be friends with these girls,SHUT OUT. 2 47 to enjoy the companionship which was something new and bright to her; but she met with no encouragement, and she said to herself that she was the poor artistâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, and that they despised her. Only Bella was more friendly, and Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s was the face she least cared for. â\\x80\\x98 You love flowers ? â\\x80\\x99 she ventured to say to Elsie in a low voice. â\\x80\\x98Yes, a little,â\\x80\\x99 answered Elsie, hesitatingly, and choosing the words because she was tolerably sure of them. â\\x80\\x98 Elsie is very fond of them,â\\x80\\x99 interposed Miss Smith, glad to feel a safe subject introduced. â\\x80\\x98 She is our chief gardener. Do you ever work in a garden, Mademoiselle ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98IPâ\\x80\\x99 answered Ursule, smiling. â\\x80\\x98No. I did not know that I might. Do English ladies work in their gardens themselves ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, yes ; even Mrs. Chambers does so.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Chambers was Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s model ; and, as Ursule looked uncomprehending, she explained, â\\x80\\x98 Mrs. Chambers at the Hall.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah, yes,â\\x80\\x99 replied Ursule, trying to look interested. â\\x80\\x98 You must have seen her on Sunday, in the pew next to us, with the roses in her bonnet.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Carnations, Bella,â\\x80\\x99 whispered the more correct Anne in English. â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t care; what does it matter? I donâ\\x80\\x99t recollect the French for â\\x80\\x98 carnations.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x99 As Ursule shook her head and looked bewildered, Miss Smith said, kindly, â\\x80\\x98 When do you mean to learn English ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I am learning it,â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, eagerly. â\\x80\\x98 I am teaching myself as much as I can. I read it every day\\'; but I am not sure when I am right, and I cannot understand Sarah. If I may, I will talk to you in English now.â\\x80\\x992.jS ONE YEAR. She looked smilingly round, as if pleading for indulgence ; but her first words sent Rose into a fit of laughter, which she tried to moderate by holding her hand over her mouth, but which very soon became uncontrollable. Ursule flushed a little as she saw a smile on the faces of the others ; however, she went bravely on, wondering, it must be confessed, at the strange manners which tolerated so much as a shadow of ridicule in such a case, still making a large-hearted allowance for what she supposed to be national customs. Miss Smith, a little uneasy for her pupils, and guessing her thoughts, inquired whether she had seen anything of the country as yet. â\\x80\\x98 But no,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, eagerly ; â\\x80\\x98 there is no one to show it me. I am alone, and it would not beâ\\x80\\x94not be convenable\\' she said, hesitating, and unable to find an English word which expressed her meaning, â\\x80\\x98 for me to make a promenade without some elder person, I suppose?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I will walk with you some day, if you like,â\\x80\\x99 said Bella. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I thank you very much ; that is very good. But who will go with us ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If you are afraid,â\\x80\\x99 said Anne, making a great effort, and looking at the wall as she spoke, â\\x80\\x98 I will go also.â\\x80\\x99 Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98Thank youâ\\x80\\x99 was warm, but her doubts were evi 172 dently not removed ; and Miss Smith, knowing rather more of French customs, said, â\\x80\\x98 The girls walk about Elmwood alone, in a way which, I dare say, will seem strange to you at first ; but you will grow inde 172 pendent in time, and find that every one knows you, and that you need have no fears.â\\x80\\x99 Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s answer was in rapid French. She had been inde 172 pendent herself in Dieppe, she said ; but then that was owing to her position. If she had been a demoiselle, she must have be-SHUT OUT. 249 haved very differently. There she had been obliged to go outâ\\x80\\x94 obliged to act for herself; but here in England she had thought that she must conform to society, to give up the solitary rambles in which she evidently delighted. It was plain that Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny had lectured her severely upon her duties in these respects. Was it really possible that she might go out of the garden alone? Except just to come to the Rectory that morn 172 ing, her church-going on Sunday, and that one stolen run to the sea, she had not dared to venture beyond the Cottage precincts ; and, in fact, there was no doubt that she was preparing herself to live a sort of prison existence, which she dreaded, but be 172 lieved to be unavoidable. It was all told so simply and humbly that Miss Smith, who alone perhaps understood the whole, felt her heart warm to the poor friendless girl. â\\x80\\x98 I am sure that Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny will not wish to keep you in,â\\x80\\x99 she said, quite energetically for her, â\\x80\\x98 when you tell her that Mr. Follaton allows his daughters perfect freedom in walking about, and that it is the same with all the families round. In 172 deed, if she does not believe me, you can ask Mr. Blunt.â\\x80\\x99 Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s face brightened. â\\x80\\x98That is charming; I think, if I can get to the sea, I shall never be lonely.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And the lanes,â\\x80\\x99 broke in Bellaâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98the Elmwood lanes are beautiful : everybody says so. Only they are horribly muddy, and covered with dead leaves just now. Nobody but Elsie goes into them while they are in this state.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am not afraid of a little mud,â\\x80\\x99 retorted Elsie. â\\x80\\x98 Mrs. Chambers says she does not like to see young ladies looking like plough-boys.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, it is quite sufficient if one of the family models herself upon Mrs. Chambersâ\\x80\\x99s principles,â\\x80\\x99 began Elsie, loftily. But she did not finish her little speech. On the contrary, she said, inONE YEAR. a low voice to her sister, â\\x80\\x98 I beg your pardon, Bella ; I believe I am very cross.â\\x80\\x99 Bella looked exceedingly complacent after this. Ursule had not understood it ; but she noticed the sharp tone in the sistersâ\\x80\\x99 voices, and wondered whether the familiar uncourteous manner was common between members of English families. At all events, she thought it prudent to rise to go; and Miss Smith, who had been exhorting herself into the necessary state of cou 172 rageousness, ventured to suggest, in spite of horrified looks from both Anne and Elsie, that she was sure Miss Villars would be pleased if Mademoiselle Lafon would join the Rectory morn- ning readings, as the arrangement would be likely to prove of service to both French and English scholars. Ursule did not immediately answer. She looked and felt very grateful to Miss Smith; but her intuition was not at fault with regard to the amount of welcome she would meet with from the others. It would have chilled her more if she had not set their frigidity down to the bare fact of their being English girls, therefore, she supposed, bound to act in this un- genial manner. She supposed it was to be overcome; still, before she entered upon the task, she felt as if she must reflect. All her usual impulsiveness seemed to have forsaken her, and she said she would let Miss Smith know. The instant she had left the room, there was a general outcry. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Miss Smith ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How could you ! â\\x80\\x99 * Is she to be fastened upon us ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Miss Smith, I shanâ\\x80\\x99t have to talk French, shall I ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, it is dreadful ! horrible ! I never knew you could be so disagreeable,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, giving the governess a hug, to make up for her words, but looking the picture of rueful dismay.SHUT OUT. 251 â\\x80\\x98We shall never get on with her; she is different from any one else. Anne hates it as much as anybody.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It will spoil all our mornings,â\\x80\\x99 Anne responded in a melan 172 choly tone of voice. â\\x80\\x98 I suppose we ought to do it. But her manner is so funny, I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand it; and I thought she pretended to be interested in things about which she could not really care. It did not seem quite straightforward.â\\x80\\x99 If any one had been at hand to point out the distinction be 172 tween courtesy and insincerity, it would have been a useful lesson for the girls ; but Miss Smith, although she felt something of the truth, was not ready in just those little explanations which were often peculiarly needed, and she allowed the impression to remain. Perhaps it hurt Bella chiefly, as, after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s thought, she said, â\\x80\\x98 If it is not straightforward, it is very nice and pleasant/ â\\x80\\x98 Oh, dear ! â\\x80\\x99 reflected Elsie, â\\x80\\x98 she will be a very bad companion for Bella. I must try and laugh her out of any sudden intimacy. Is this Mademoiselle Lafon to be your newest and dearest friend, Bella?â\\x80\\x99 she said aloud. â\\x80\\x98 That does not matter to you,â\\x80\\x99 said her sister, angrily. â\\x80\\x98 What will Mrs. Chambers say ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Mrs. Chambers ! As if this girl would interfere with her ! Why, by her own confession, she is nobody.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then I canâ\\x80\\x99t understand why you like her so much.â\\x80\\x99 * I donâ\\x80\\x99t like her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You let her fancy that you do : you offer to walk with her, at all events.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What nonsense, Elsie ! As if one must mean exactly all tnat one says to people ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Elsieâ\\x80\\x94Bella ! â\\x80\\x99 began Miss Smith, nervously, â\\x80\\x98 the reading was not finished. Rose, my dear, fetch your copy. We must252 ONE YEAR. not really talk any more about Mademoiselle Lafon ; only I am sure it will be a great advantage to you all if she will read French with us. I shall be thankful for the help, myself.â\\x80\\x99 Bella yawned. â\\x80\\x98Never mind about those stupid Carthaginians, Miss Smith. I hear Aunt Clareâ\\x80\\x99s step in the passage.â\\x80\\x99 She was greeted by Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s exclamation- â\\x80\\x98 It was too bad of you to send that French girl up here, Aunt Clare ! And only think ! Miss Smith has entrapped us in f o speaking French every morning by asking her to come and read.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I am very glad, I am indeed. My dear, it is so terribly lonely for her, with only that poor Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny for a companion ; and I was sure that you would like her, and be glad of a new friend.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Why does she not go back to Dieppe?â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, per 172 versely. â\\x80\\x98Just fancy, she is afraid to walk about our roads by herself ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Poor child ! She does not know our ways ; she is very young.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Nearly as old as Anne. Anne, speak ! â\\x80\\x99 Anne lifted her head from the book which she was studying laboriously, and smiled back in return for her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s bright loving look. But she only shook her head. â\\x80\\x98 There, Aunt Clare, it is all your fault, and you must go away. Anne says that we are idling and wasting our time disgracefully. But, you see, French invasions donâ\\x80\\x99t agree with Britannic constitutions; and I, for one, donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to run counter to my forefathers. Now, Bella, quick ! Pick up that unfortunate Duillius, and rehearse his deeds.â\\x80\\x99 If Ursule, walking quickly home, could have looked back into the Rectory school-room, she would have been fairly puzzled atSHUT OUT 253 the difference between Elsie in her shy frigid society mood, and Elsie at her ease, warm-hearted, affectionate, and bright. With a sigh, she relinquished her girlish hopeful visions of the pleasant intercourse which she had ventured to dream of as possible. There was a wall between herself and all of them, except per 172 haps Bella, who had shown some cordiality; the same sort of wall as she felt also in speaking to Clementâ\\x80\\x94a cold shade which enveloped everybody. She looked round her with a little shiver. November was close at hand, and Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s trees were sending down showers of yellow leaves into the thick red mud below ; the air was chilly and damp ; over everything was the touch of decay. She had never felt it so before. Not that autumn did not come in even more coldly at Dieppe ; but, because the air was keen and dry, the cold seemed fresh and invigorating ; and there were no leaves to flutter dismally about, but bright colours in place of the English drabs and browns in their cheerless monotony, and shrill merry voices in the air. Could she bear it ? Should she leave Madame there, with Sarah to take care of her, and her nephew to visit her occasionally, and go back her 172 selfâ\\x80\\x94back to the dear old house, back to the Sansons, back to him 1 A great yearning for it rose in her heart. Why should she stay ? She owed nothing really to Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny ; she was not bound to her by any ties of blood ; she was miserable, wretched here. She longed to feel kind old Madameâ\\x80\\x99s arms about her neck, and to hear her little scream of welcome. She felt as if this England would freeze all the warmth out of her, body and heart. Why should she endure it ? Her face changed and hardened into determination, she walked resolutely into the Cottage, up the stairs, into Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s room ; she would tell her that she was welcome to live on at the Cottage, but that, for herself, she must go back to the old faces, the254 ONE YEAR. friendly shores : she would not consent to live as a stranger all her life. The words of her little speech rose to her lips as she entered the room. â\\x80\\x98 Ursule, is that you ? Are you come at last ? â\\x80\\x99 said the weary voice. â\\x80\\x98 Dear Madame, you have not wanted me, surely ? I left Mademoiselle Villars here, and she passed me on the road returning.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, that woman ! She is so feeble, so small in her ideas, it is impossible to converse with her ; besides that, I am in great painâ\\x80\\x94such pain, child ! It does me good to hear your step. Everything is strange. For you, it matters littleâ\\x80\\x94you can go about, can have variety and distraction ; but for me ! Ah, it is very sad to be in a strange land ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Dear Madame ! â\\x80\\x99 faltered Ursule. How was it possible for her to inflict the blow she had been preparing ? How could she tell her that she, too, meant to desert her ? If Madame had known all that had just passed through the girlâ\\x80\\x99s mind, she could have adopted no better course in order to shake the newly formed resolution. â\\x80\\x98 Here, you seem to me to be my own child, the only thing left to me. As to Clement, he is very well ; but he is a man, he has his own occupationsâ\\x80\\x94one must not expect too much. I do not complain : you know it is contrary to my nature. I do not wish you to stay here in this room with me always : I prefer your taking the air occasionally, and coming back refreshed. But it is terribly lonely for me when you are away. I sometimes wish,â\\x80\\x99 continued the poor invalid, sighing, â\\x80\\x98that I had so much as Madame Sansonâ\\x80\\x99s face to regard. She was not comme il faut, but she was worthy.â\\x80\\x99 Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s whole face had brightened. â\\x80\\x98Then you like me aSHUT OUT. 2 55 little morsel after all, Madame ? â\\x80\\x99 she said, with a pretty caress 172 ing gesture. â\\x80\\x98Yes,petite ; I cannot spare you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x981 will not go, Madame ; I promise it,â\\x80\\x99 she said, gravely. For the words contained a larger pledge than Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny imagined, and, in making it, she put aside all those wishes which a few minutes before seemed irresistible. She gave up her country and her friends ; she accepted the entire charge of Madame, with her weakness, and her crossness, and her varia 172 bility ; she bound herself to long hours of nursing and thankless care : but she felt as if those few words of affection, those signs of dependence, were enough to reconcile her to all. â\\x80\\x98 If only she loves me, I can do it ; â\\x80\\x99 and from her heart, that moment, Ursule sent up an earnest prayer that she might be blessed in the work she had undertaken, and taught how best to fulfil her duty. All her dissatisfied feelings fled. She had felt, poor child, as if she was driven to stand alone in the worldâ\\x80\\x94as if no one would so much as lend her a support ; but if there was one who, as Madame said, listened for her step and cared whether she was in the room, everything, it seemed to her, would be endurable. Her spirits went up ; she danced merrily about the room, made fun of her visit to the Rectory, and actually mimicked Anne and Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s shy manner and mauvaise honte. Madame forgot her pain in watching her, was graciousâ\\x80\\x94even affectionate ; and the day closed a great deal more brightly than it began. The day closed, and another came, and the weeks followed each other ; and Ursule lived what seemed a monotonous, cheer 172 less life, but she did not once repent of her decision. True, Madameâ\\x80\\x99s complaints were continual; true, very rarely did she show the smallest symptom of affection ; true, when Clement was there, Ursule was treated with indifference : in256 ONE YEAR. spite of all, the girl saw that she was necessary to her comfort, and that without her the poor, feeble, suffering woman would have been doubly desolate. For the rest, her spirits were buoy 172 ant, and she managed to extract a good deal of self amusement out of her position. She was a proprietress, and began to taste the sweets of ownership. She very soon picked up enough English to make herself understood. It was an unfavourable time of the year for gardening ; but she was seized with a great desire to distinguish herself in that pursuit, and old Thomas, the gardener, who came once a week for a dayâ\\x80\\x99s labour, was soon won over by her pretty ways to a half-wondering, half- affectionate admiration, blended with an extraordinary contempt for her foreign notions. â\\x80\\x98 From what I can see,â\\x80\\x99 he confided to his wife, â\\x80\\x98 they mostly lives upon green food. It stands to reason thereâ\\x80\\x99s a time for salads, like there be for other things ; and Madam Blunt knew it, and didnâ\\x80\\x99t ax for cos-lettuces in winter : but this young thing, herâ\\x80\\x99s always driving at me to send â\\x80\\x99em in for the old lady, and wanting all sorts of outlandish rubbish to mix up with â\\x80\\x99em. Well, sheâ\\x80\\x99s but young, and I sim I must do what I can for her.â\\x80\\x99 By degrees, this was what all those who had anything to do with Ursule began to feelâ\\x80\\x94with one exception. The excep 172 tion was Sarah. She felt as if her rigid honesty and economy gave her a right to be as disagreeable as she pleased; and exceedingly disagreeable she contrived, beyond a doubt, to make herself. She pretended to be unable to understand her young mistress; she delighted in convicting her in an error; on many occasions she flatly disobeyed her orders, on the plea that they were not such as she had been accustomed to receive ; and, what was worse, she encouraged the niece whoUrsule and the Gardener. P. 181SHUT OUT. 2 57 was under her to treat Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s directions with the same con 172 tempt. She really did despise Ursule ; she did not believe she would have the courage to find fault. Once or twice, to be sure, she had caught a glance of her eye which stag 172 gered her for a moment, but nothing more ; and Sarah resolved that, as it was her evil fate to submit to the nominal rule of a young girl, she would take care that the rule was but nominal, and that the real government of the house should rest with her. Ursule was shrewd, and she had no difficulty in understand ing Sarahâ\\x80\\x99s tactics, but much in determining how to meet them. She was hardly aware of the value of the old servant, for her virtues were such as are more frequently met with in France than England ; and she was quite alive to her faults. Conse 172 quently, as far as she was concerned, she would have been quite ready to part with her, and, indeed, would have considered it a relief. But what would Clement say ? He had an affection for the old woman, and had impressed upon Ursule her good for 172 tune in securing her services : he had expressed himself indebted to her for her care of his mother. She did not feel as if she could venture to run counter to his wishes, and yet she was anything but satisfied with her own position. At last, one day, there arrived a crisis. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny had been more than usually suffering, and Ursule had passed all the morning in her room. In the afternoon she promised herself a treatâ\\x80\\x94a run to the sea with Jock, who had been left at the Cottage by his master, and had become her fastest friend ; and, accordingly, when the bell was answered by the girl Bessy, she desired her to let the. dog out of the yard into the garden. Jockâ\\x80\\x99s first rush on these occasions was to the windows, to give notice of his readiness for a start ; 17258 ONE YEAR. and she waited, until she began to wonder at the delay, for his well-known yelp of impatient delight. At last she rang the bell again, to inquire whether he had been let out, and was told with much pertness by Betty that she was waiting until she had finished doing what Sarah had put her to. The moment the girl had said it, and glanced in Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s face, she repented. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes flashed fire, and only by a strong effort could she control herself to say, slowly and distinctly, â\\x80\\x98 I do not think you remember who I am : I do not think you have ever understood that you are to obey me first of all. Understand it now, if you please, or you cannot remain in my service.â\\x80\\x99 Half frightened, half indignant, Bessy muttered something about leaving. â\\x80\\x98 Certainly : I will arrange with your aunt when that shall be. Be good enough to go and let out the dog.â\\x80\\x99 Instead of Jock, came Sarah in a fury of indignation to know what Miss Lafon meant by dismissing her niece. She was not accustomed to such doings, and would like to know what was intended by them. â\\x80\\x98 It means,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, still restraining her natural inclina 172 tion to volubility, and speaking very quietly, â\\x80\\x98 that I expect to be treated in future with respect. Both Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny and I have reason to complain of the manner in which you refuse to attend to our wishes ; and however much we might regret to be obliged to dismiss you after your long service with Madame Blunt, we shall be forced to decide upon doing so unless you can make up your mind to behave differently.â\\x80\\x99 Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s heart beat ; but she had conquered. Whether the gravity and dignity of her little speech overawed Sarah, or whether conscience aided her in the pricks it administered, it isSHUT OUT. 2 59 certain that Sarah was dumbfoundered. She looked at Ursule in astonishment, and then fairly retreated, with no other mani 172 festation of hostility than a slam of the door. In another minute Jock, in an ecstasy of delight, was barking outside the window; and Ursule, smiling to herself at her own valour, left her dignity at the Cottage and ran off across the meadows to the sea. Instead of leaving, Bessy apologised. She was not a bad sort of girl on the whole, and her spirit of insubordination was the result of her auntâ\\x80\\x99s constant fault-finding with the new 172 comers. She looked so awe-struck and frightened for a few days, that Ursule reproached herself with her own severity, and would perhaps have spoiled its effect with a little over-kindness, if Bessy had not kept out of the way. Altogether, as the winter days drew on, the household fell into order. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny never quitted her room; Ursule sat with her, employ 172 ing herself happily in endless ways, adapting herself with French pliancy to the circumstances of her new life, and becoming bolder in the length of Ijer solitary rambles with Jock. She declined the regular readings at the Rectory, to the Follatonsâ\\x80\\x99 great relief, but once now and then joined in them. Anne and Elsie believed themselves absolved from further civilities ; Miss Villars could never press a subject ; and when Clement found either of his cousins at the Cottage, that one was invariably Bellaâ\\x80\\x94a circumstance which did not impress him favourably with Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s discernment. Sometimesâ\\x80\\x94not very oftenâ\\x80\\x94he stayed from Saturday till Monday at Elmwood, and then she had a companion in the great high pew, in a corner of which she used to sit and wonder at the unwieldy monuments which protruded from the walls, the dead taking up so much room that there was scarcely enough 17â\\x80\\x94226o ONE YEAR. left for the living. Before she knew the language sufficiently well to be able to follow Mr. Follaton in his polished, labori 172 ously put together sermon, she found herself spelling out the old inscriptions which commemorated the Urbanity and chearful Benevolence of the best of men or women, stuck up in old, dusty, disfigured corners, not without a certain pathos in their ancient griminessâ\\x80\\x94in the cobwebs, which stretched across from one tale of virtues to anotherâ\\x80\\x94in their pitiful stories of the young snatched awayâ\\x80\\x94the young, who would have been so very old by this time, had they lived. St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s was a beau 172 tiful, disfigured church, which had never been restored. Side by side with lumbering erections of the present century, sprang noble arches, grey and solemn ; and nothing could exceed the beauty of the lines of the north windows, through which Ursule watched the waving elms and the flickering shadows of their branches. Very soon she began to love the old church. A quiet repose about it was unlike her own nature, and all the more dear. She liked to go there directly the bell began, pass 172 ing old Thomas, her gardener, who was one of the bell-ringers, with a friendly nod, and going swiftly up the aisle to her pew. The old men at the west end chattered and laughed in under 172 tones; the elm branches outside swayed backwards and for 172 wards ; a little robin or two often came and sang glad little songs of praise. Ursule felt as if those quiet moments pre 172 pared her for the service that was coming ; and, perhaps, it was at these times when any one who had known and cared for her would have been most struck with the change which was grow 172 ing over her face, altering its wayward wilfulness of expression into a sweet steadfastness.CHAPTER XV. THE THREE SISTERS. Let me not dwell so much within My bounded heart. A. L. Waring. OVEMBER was rather a busy month in the Elm 172 wood year. There were certain old-established charities which held high days about this time : the blanket-lending, preceded by a grand marking at the Rectory ; and the clothing-club sale, when the school-house was trans 172 mogrified into a great shop, and all the available ladies of the parish turned themselves into shop-women for two days, and sold countless yards of flannel and calico to the parishioners. In spite of the trouble and fatigue, the girls considered it very good fun. There was a pleasant bustle and excitement about the arrival of the great waggon, with its bales of goods, and the fitting-up the school-room with temporary counters, and arranging all that was wanted behind it. Anne was the most busy; and she came home a perfect mass of white fluff and dust, so that there was a cry of amazement at her appearance. â\\x80\\x98Am I so bad?â\\x80\\x99 said she, good-humouredly. â\\x80\\x98 Never mind; it will all brush off.â\\x80\\x992Ã\\x932 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Is everything ready ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Miss Villars â\\x80\\x98 Everything that really matters. The things have all arrived, and we have stowed them away as well as we can ; but Elsie is staying behind, because she fancies she might make the room look prettier.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Has she any one with her ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes. Mrs. Chambers was driving by in the pony carriage, and came in to see what was doing. Elsie persuaded her to stop ; for it is just the sort of thing she understands so well.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I think I will go down and help them,â\\x80\\x99 said Bella, getting up quickly. â\\x80\\x98 My dear, you said you were so tired ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I am quite rested now. And they must want more hands.â\\x80\\x99 * That is very kind of you, my dear,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Villars, unsus 172 pectingly, while Anne looked uncomfortable. â\\x80\\x98 Still I really donâ\\x80\\x99t like your tiring yourself out so thoroughly. I am sure you said you had a headache.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, but it is better; and I should not like to leave it all to them,â\\x80\\x99 explained Bella, wishing to appear self-denying while she had her own way. â\\x80\\x98 Here is Miss Lafon ! â\\x80\\x99 said little Rose, popping her head into the drawing-room, and retreating again, according to her sistersâ\\x80\\x99 practice of avoiding visitors. Anne tried to follow, but onlymetUrsule in the doorway, and became doubly embarrassed ; while Ursule, herself quiet and self-composed, stood aside to let her pass, and, finding her unresolved what to do, put out her hand, and saying, â\\x80\\x98 Do not let me detain youâ\\x80\\x94I have only a message for Miss Villars,â\\x80\\x99 walked into the room. â\\x80\\x98 A message for me ?â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Villars, overhearing the words, and coming forward.THE THREE SISTERS. 263 â\\x80\\x98 Mr. Blunt is here,â\\x80\\x99 was Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s answer. Then, in explana 172 tion, she went on, â\\x80\\x98 He came this morning to shoot with those gentlemenâ\\x80\\x94Mr. Chambers, I think, is oneâ\\x80\\x94and he only called at the Cottage, in passing, to see Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny for a moment ; but he desired that you might be asked to send a box to the station for him. He said you would comprehend.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I do not know whom I can send,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Villars, in a perplexed tone. â\\x80\\x98 Every one is busy about the clothing-club. Bella, who can go ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Tom, I suppose.â\\x80\\x99 * No ; I sent Tom to Bircham. Dear me, it is very awkward.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Let me take it,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, pleasantly. â\\x80\\x98 No, indeed ; it is very kind of you to think of such a thing, but quite out of the question. There is the box by the window; you see it is too large for you to carry.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 There is a picture inside it,â\\x80\\x99 said Bella. â\\x80\\x98 Come and look at it : the lid is not fastened.â\\x80\\x99 Miss Villars nodded contentedly in answer to Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98 May I ? â\\x80\\x99 and she looked into the box, while Bella unfastened the front, and took out one or two layers of silver paper. But at the first glance the colour rushed into her face, and tears filled her eyes. It was her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s painting of the gather 172 ing stormâ\\x80\\x94the favourite picture about which brother and sister used to invent stories, wild and weird, of shipwrecked sailors and sunken rocks, and the vast dark solitudes under the great seas, in which neither fish nor plant can liveâ\\x80\\x94the picture which Mr. Blunt carried away with him. Ursule had often thought of it ; she had sought about the cottage rooms with the hope of find 172 ing it in some comer, but unsuccessfully, and here it met her unprepared. Quiet Miss Villars, looking at her for some word of admiration, was horrified to see the look of intense yearning2Ã\\x934 ONE YEAR. sorrow in her eyesâ\\x80\\x94the greedy expression with which they seemed to fasten upon the pictureâ\\x80\\x94the locking together of her hands with an almost convulsive clasp. â\\x80\\x98 My dear ! â\\x80\\x99 she said ;â\\x80¢ â\\x80\\x98 my dear ! â\\x80\\x99 Ursule turned round with a start. â\\x80\\x98 Do you think I might have it again?â\\x80\\x99 she said, eagerly, her eyes brimming over with great tears. Miss Villars was too much bewildered to answer. She looked helplessly at Bella, who was curiously watching, and took up the word. â\\x80\\x98 Have it again ? What do you mean ? It is Clement Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s picture, you know.â\\x80\\x99 * Ah, I know. C\\'est juste\\' said Ursule, recovering her 172 self. â\\x80\\x98 It was painted by my father, andâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94I beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x99 she added, feeling it impossible just then to speak of Louis. â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Villars, taking her hand kindly, â\\x80\\x98 I am so sorry we showed it to you so thoughtlessly. Clement told us he had bought it abroad ; but I had no idea it was from your father. I am sure it is a painting any one may be proud of. Oh dear, how sorry I am ! â\\x80\\x99 Ursule could not help smiling through her tears. â\\x80\\x98 You do not know how glad I Ã¡m to see it again. It is like a piece of our home. Thank you, with all my heart.â\\x80\\x99 She looked longingly at it as Bella replaced the coverings, but did not again repeat her desire, and turned to go away when she found that Miss Villarsâ\\x80\\x99s distress still continued â\\x80\\x98 I am coming part of the way with you,â\\x80\\x99 announced Bella. No.â\\x80\\x94Pray, Miss Lafon, do persuade her not to go; she is not strong, and she said just now that she had a head 172 ache; but Elsie is still at the school-room, trying to arrangeTHE THREE SISTERS. things for to-morrow, and she thinks she must go again to help her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Do you want so much to go ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Ursule. â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said Bella, doubtfully; then more boldly, â\\x80\\x98No. But it would be very unkind not to help Elsie.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule meditated for a moment. She had little desire to undertake the task, yet she was touched by Miss Villarsâ\\x80\\x99s kind manner towards her just now, and wished to spare her anxiety. â\\x80\\x98 If that is all, and if you think I can be of any use, I will go thereâ\\x80\\x94only to save Bella,â\\x80\\x99 she said, hesitatingly. Miss Villarsâ\\x80\\x99s gratitude was great ; and Bella had no choice but to submit, although with a very bad grace, as she took care to show directly Ursule was out of hearing, by a prediction, which had at least the eifect of making her aunt uncomfortable, that both Elsie and Mrs. Chambers would wish the new-comer anywhere but in the midst of their labours. Ursule had entirely relinquished the hope of being on friendly terms with the Rectory family. As she walked along now, she could not help thinking with a little contempt of their un 172 formed manners and Anneâ\\x80\\x99s especially ungainly ways, wonder 172 ing at the self-concentration which seemed to enwrap itself con 172 tentedly in Elmwood and its affairs, and to stand so stiffly on its own ground that it would scarcely so much as recognize any other. Their worst sides had been shown to her; and even in their relations to one another, what she saw seemed more brusque and unceremonious than affectionate, and totally unlike any type of family life which she had ever before conceived. Elsie and Mrs. Chambers were standing in the middle of the school-room when Ursule reached the door, rather inclined to despair over the general want of effect, and to feel as if their efforts had ended in failure. Mrs. Chambers was a pleasant-206 ONE YEAR. faced little woman, fashionably dressed, brisk, and decided. She knew Ursule only by sight, and was a little curious to see what she was like ; so that Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s hesitating invitation to enter was taken out of her mouth, and made most cordial by the change of speaker, while Mrs. Chambers forestalled Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s offer by begging her to give them the benefit of her taste in making a better arrangement of their uninviting materials. To add to the charm, it was all said in the purest French ; and Ursule, with brightening eyes, thought her delightful, and plunged at once with keen interest into the affair. It was curious to see how rapidly she produced an effectâ\\x80\\x94how the homeliest stuffs seemed to grow picturesque by a little judicious contrast and French touches of taste ; so that Elsie, looking on, acknowledged warmly how much she had done for them ; and as to Mrs. Chambers, she was enthusiastic in her thanks and her admiration. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s piquante face and naturally graceful manners won her heart at once. She was inclined to blame Elsie for not having introduced Mademoiselle Lafon to her before, and prompt in her assurance of not allowing the ac 172 quaintance to drop. Elsie also felt grateful for the first time to the new-comer. A keen delight in anything that was pretty made her appreciate Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s taste, and she praised it heartily after she reached home, and related Mrs. Chambersâ\\x80\\x99s admiration without a shadow of unworthy jealousy. Anne listened quietly, glad that her sister was pleased, although she thought the appearance was of very little consequence, so long as the women had the things they wanted for their money ; and was a little afraid that the effect of the picturesque arrangement might have spoiled her own plans for the different materials being at hand directly they were wanted. Bella looked up, and said contemptuously,THE THREE SISTERS. 267 â\\x80\\x98 What a fuss you make about trifles, Elsie ! One would suppose that Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s just going in for five minutes had done wonderful things ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You will see that it looks a great deal better this year than it has ever done before.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Any new person coming in can arrange things differently.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, good-humouredly, â\\x80\\x98you believe in Mrs. Chambers, you know, Bella, and she said that, until she saw it, she could not have supposed it possible to make so much out of so little. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s all I know.â\\x80\\x99 * Did she speak to Ursule, then ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, she has gone wild about her. She thinks her pretty, and graceful, and clever, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Just seeing her in that way ! â\\x80\\x99 said Bella, disparagingly. â\\x80\\x98 I suppose you took care to tell Mrs. Chambers who she was ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Not I. Why, what should I tell ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t think it is at all fair for Mrs. Chambers to think she is a lady, and all that. She is nothing but a common painterâ\\x80\\x99s daughter; and I am sure people wonâ\\x80\\x99t like to associate with her without knowing. You ought to have said that.â\\x80\\x99 Elsie looked in amazement at her sister, and said^jnore gently than usual, â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Bella ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You would not be so ungenerous ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is not being ungenerous : it is the truth.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is not our business to say, without being asked. Besides, I thought you were more her friend than any of us, and that you would be delighted to hear that she was liked.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, never mind ! â\\x80\\x99 said Bella, crossly. â\\x80\\x98 I only say I think it is very unfair upon Mrs. Chambers, and you and Anne never understand her.â\\x80\\x99268 ONE YEAR. It was an accusation at which Elsie could only smile ; but she said no more on the subject, and asked Anne for Miss Villars. â\\x80\\x98 Clement has been down for a dayâ\\x80\\x99s shooting, and sent a message to desire that his picture might meet him at the station. There was only little Bob Coombes available, and Aunt Clare did not altogether like trusting him; so she and Rose have started off as a sort of rear-guard. Of course, he goes back by the 5.10 train.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My dear old Anne, even in the dark I can see you look dreadfully tired and dusty.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Dusty, am I ? I thought I was presentable. â\\x80\\x98No, you are not. There!â\\x80\\x99 giving her collar a pull, â\\x80\\x98and there ! â\\x80\\x99 smoothing her hair, â\\x80\\x98 and there ! â\\x80\\x99 taking her face in her hands, and giving her a kiss. â\\x80\\x98 Now, come away up-stairs, and be tidied.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Nell ! â\\x80\\x99 Nevertheless Anne submitted, it being a tolerably fixed law in her mind that Elsie should have her own way, although her own views of adornment and her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s varied very considerably. Miss Villars and Rose, meanwhileâ\\x80\\x94the latter in high spirits over the darkness and the damp, which gave rather an adventurous air to the expeditionâ\\x80\\x94walked briskly up and down the platform, keeping Bob Coombes and his charge in view, and waiting for Clement, who came in at last, very wet and muddy, having just had time to leave a brace of pheasants at the Cottage on his way. He could talk at first of nothing but their good sport, then, recollecting, caught himself up with, â\\x80\\x98I beg your pardon. Do you mean that you have come here this cold evening on purpose to secure the safe delivery of the picture ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, it was not a good day for anything reaching its desti-THE THREE SISTERS. 269 nation,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Villars, laughing, â\\x80\\x98 so I thought I had better see to this myself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Indeed, I did not think of inflicting the labour upon you. Thank you, excessively : you know that I prize it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes; but you did not tell us that the painter was Ma 172 demoiselle Lafonâ\\x80\\x99s father. I am afraid I gave the poor girl a sad shock to-day, by showing it to her. I was quite uncon 172 scious.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Never mind,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, carelessly; I imagine she will easily recover from it. Besides, why should it shock her? Her father is alive and well, though, from what I gathered, I dare say he may be a bit of a scoundrel, and she need not faint be 172 cause she sees one of his pictures.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am sure that she felt it a good deal, from some reason or other,â\\x80\\x99 answered Miss Villars, with unusual persistency. â\\x80\\x98 Possibly, thenâ\\x80\\x94though I donâ\\x80\\x99t see why. But, on the whole, how does she get on? How do you like her? Rose doesnâ\\x80\\x99t hear : she is taken up with balancing her large self upon the weighing-machine. How do you all like her?â\\x80\\x99 repeated Cle 172 ment. â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x99 said she, with a little sigh. â\\x80\\x98 She ought to be happy,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Blunt, quickly. â\\x80\\x98 There are the girls, plenty of them and near at hand, to make it pleasant.â\\x80\\x99 There was a little irritation in his tone, as if he was trying to assert a doubtful fact ; but Miss Villars did not perceive it, and answered â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 doubtfully, because she did not know what else to say. â\\x80\\x98 She will get used to things by-and-bye,â\\x80\\x99 persisted her com 172 panion. â\\x80\\x98 You think she is kind to my poor aunt ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, yes ! â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Villars, starting, having been letting270 ONE YEAR. her doubts about kindness take the other direction, and feeling guilty of some want of sympathy with Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny. â\\x80\\x98 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s good hearing. I donâ\\x80\\x99t fancy, between ourselves, it was always so. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s the train; punctual, for a wonder. Good-bye, Miss Villars ; good-bye, Rose. Iâ\\x80\\x99m particularly grateful for your care of my picture.â\\x80\\x99 With a shriek the train moved slowly off into the outside darkness; the lamps glimmered on the wet boards; porters shouldered great loads of luggage ; the few passengers pressed out of the door; Miss Villars and Rose went more leisurely after them, and down the steps. * Doesnâ\\x80\\x99t the wind howl, Aunt Clare ? â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Rose. â\\x80\\x98Oh, I hope it wonâ\\x80\\x99t be a wet day for the clothing-club to 172 morrow.â\\x80\\x99 There was no doubt, at all events, that it would be a stormy night; and Miss Villars hurried on, afraid that she had been imprudent in bringing out the child, and worrying herself also with the fear that she was not doing all that was kind for Ursule Lafon. Decidedly, they saw very little of her ; but the general opinion of the family was, that to see much of her would not be desirable, and Miss Villars was quite unprepared to combat the family opinion. What could she do? Only very vague answers to the question came into her head before they reached the green gate of the Rectory, and she dismissed the subject with a sigh. Perhaps the Rectory drawing-room never looked so pleasant as of a winterâ\\x80\\x99s evening, when all the family were collected round the fire. By candle-light the colours of the furniture appeared less faded, and an unusually large grate, on which a log generally crackled, was, in itself, sufficient to make a less cosy room cheerful. The great oriel window was well curtained,THE THREE SISTERS. 271 and outside the wind might rage or cry as rnudly as it pleased without making any impression upon the walls of the old house. Sometimes, when tea was finished, Mr. Follaton betook himself to his study, and there remained until prayer-time called him forth ; occasionally, as on this night, he came into the drawing 172 room to sit by the side of the fire, in his capacious arm-chair, and read lighter literature in the form of Quarterlies or the Evening Mail. Looking at him, it was easy to see from whom Anne derived her features ; and yet, for all his plainness, Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were his ; and for all his plainness, too, you would never wish him to be better looking than he was. The head, with its short, iron-grey hair, was massive ; the features rugged, but kindly, absent in expression, but at times startling in their earnestness, without any signs of humour, and without any readiness to yield. It was almost ludicrous to see how the same face, softened into feminine nature, looked out of Anne as she sat next to her father, enjoying the idleness which, the girls proclaimed, the busy day had earned, in a singularly uncom 172 fortable high-backed chairâ\\x80\\x94taken not from preference, but because, in Anneâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, one chair was as good as another, and comfort was a thing more to be talked about than experienced. Elsie sat on the ground, resting her head against her sister. Contrary to custom, she was watching the fire, rather than join 172 ing in the conversation, which, with Miss Villars for a leader, was apt to be more discursive than brilliant. Clementâ\\x80\\x99s visit was talked over, and then the picture, and Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s emotion at its sight. Bella extracted that her aunt had mentioned the subject to their cousin, and had understood him to say there was no reason she should have be\\'en distressed at sight of it, since her father was alive and well, though, it might be, some 172 thing of a scamp.272 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 There ! â\\x80\\x99 said Bella, triumphantly ; but no one answered her. Her sisters were looking into the fire ; her father, with knitted brows, was pondering over a review of the last Hindu book. Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s exclamation passed unheeded, and she said nothing more to provoke comment. They were all silent for a time, down to small Rose ; the log sputtered and crackled, the wind shook the windows with angry gusts, and a distant roar sounded like a still mightier power lashing itself into fury against the rocks. * Anne,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Follaton, laying down his review, â\\x80\\x98 I shall be glad if you will go with me to Defforton to-morrow.â\\x80\\x99 * To-morrow ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 To-morrow ? Oh, papa, you forget ! â\\x80\\x99 * What have I forgotten, my dear ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The clothing-clubâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t you recollect ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Surely it is not the time for the clothing sale,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Follaton, passing his hand across his forehead. â\\x80\\x98 Septemberâ\\x80\\x94 October â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98It is November now, papaâ\\x80\\x94moreâ\\x80\\x99s the pityâ\\x80\\x99 added Elsie, under her breath. â\\x80\\x98 I believe you are right,â\\x80\\x99 said her father, after a minuteâ\\x80\\x99s reflection. â\\x80\\x98 But did you say the affair would take place to 172 morrow ? Surely not : the arrangements have not been made.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Papa, we asked you, and you said Aunt Clare was to order it all to come as usual.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I was right, I hope ? â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Villars, nervously. â\\x80\\x98 I am very much indebted to you,â\\x80\\x99 he said, with the old- fashioned politeness which he always displayed to her. â\\x80\\x98 But, Anne, I believe I have to perform certain duties at the clothing sale ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, papa; you know you are always there to file the cards.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I remember. Then I must postpone going to Defforton. ITHE THREE SISTERS. 273 am positive I have seen a direct contradiction of a statement of this writer, but I cannot lay my hand upon it without going to the Chapter library. The man knows nothing of the matterâ\\x80\\x94 that is the truthâ\\x80\\x94and makes deductions without any care to satisfy himself that his premises are correct. It becomes no 172 thing less than unprincipled;â\\x80\\x99 and Mr. Follaton, who could not have persuaded himself to destroy a snail, looked as if he were prepared to demolish the whole race of reviewers at a stroke. â\\x80\\x98 Papa,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, mischievouslyâ\\x80\\x94she always enjoyed stirring her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s wrath against literary offendersâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 that book seems as if it would be a very interesting production for us to read ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Because, as I am more and more forced to acknowledge, women form their judgments from appearances, undirected by judgment. You think it would be interesting since it is written in a pleasant, frivolous style â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, looking over his shoulder at the hard words. â\\x80\\x98Without depth or anything which requires common thought to comprehend â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! â\\x80\\x99 again. â\\x80\\x98And that on a subject which has been opened out by solid writers into an almost boundless field. His ignorance is abso 172 lutely appalling ! I doubt whether he so much as knows the difference between Buddhism and Hinduism; he talks about Tukaram as the founder of a sect, instead of what he was, a poet of the people, an expounder of just the ordinary panthe 172 istic Hindu doctrines, seen from the elevation of a nature somewhat in advance of its contemporaries in moral character ; added to which, his remarks upon the commentaries of Sanka- rÃ¡chÃ¡rya â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Papa, papa ! â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, merrily, taking his face between her hands and kissing his forehead.274 ONE YEAR. Poor Mr. Follaton looked up, fairly puzzled. â\\x80\\x98What is the matter, my dear ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If that is the frivolous language to which you allude, I can only say that you must provide yourself with two or three pre- Adamite daughters accustomed to long names, before you can expect to have it read aloud to you.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Follaton smiled abstractedly. He took up the review again, and read on, without any perception of the fact that Elsie and Bella were playing duets, and chattering busily to their aunt upon what would be the order of the next day. â\\x80\\x98 I hope you asked Mademoiselle Lafon, poor girl ! â\\x80\\x99 said kind-hearted Miss Villars. â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 Elsie said, looking a little ashamed of herself, â\\x80\\x98I did not think of it. What would be the fun to her, Aunt Clare, knowing none of the people ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Perhaps it might be the means of her growing to know some of them.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She would not care. Is it likely that a French girl, suddenly transplanted here, should care to know the poor ! Besides, I expect Miss Lafon is fastidious. Oh, Aunt Clare, if she goes there, she will put us all out ! â\\x80\\x99 Miss Villars sighed, and again dropped Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s cause. â\\x80\\x98 The Roman Catholic priest came over from Heatherby, to 172 day,â\\x80\\x99 announced Anne. â\\x80\\x98 And saw Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, I suppose ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know ; I suppose so. I met him coming out of the Cottage.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ursule will be glad if she missed him,â\\x80\\x99 said Bella. â\\x80\\x98 She declares he always treats her as if she were a renegade, and at Dieppe she was never molested. But she says she thinks sheTHE THREE SISTERS. 275 was more nearly being a Romanist there than here. She likes St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s so much.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am glad she has the taste/ said Elsie, briefly. â\\x80\\x98 I believe you think there was never any place like Elmwood in the world ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, I do. Go on, Bella; one, two, three; turn, turn, turn. Eapa, are you tired of our tum-tumming ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Not at all, my dear; I have not been attending to it, said Mr. Follaton, briskly, shutting his book, and. coming over to stand behind his daughters. â\\x80\\x98 Very good, very pretty. I am pleased that you do not neglect your practising.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The wind is blowing sadly to-night, as far as to-morrowâ\\x80\\x99s prospects are concerned,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Villars, rising also to put away her work. â\\x80\\x98 Ah, to-morrowâ\\x80\\x94the clothing sale, did you say ? You must remind me of it in the morning, children, lest it should escape my memory.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, papa,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, saucily, we will remind you ; but take care you donâ\\x80\\x99t affront Maria Tucker by calling her Mrs. Sany- kanychary, or any other such name out of that frivolous volume of yours ! â\\x80\\x99 18â\\x80\\x942CHAPTER XVI. THE SPRING-TIDE. The old sea-wall (he cried) is downe, The rising tide comes on apace, And boats adrift in yonder towne Go sailing uppe the market-place. Jean Ingelow. |HE next day was, according to Rose, not quite so horrid as she expected; but neither was it exactly the weather to be chosen for any parish gathering. The rain had ceased, but the hills were blurred with mist; grey masses of cloud drove wildly across the sky ; the last yellow leaves whirled off the trees, underneath ; red mud lay deep in the roads. One or two of the women, whose tickets were fixed for an early hour, procured a lift in the carrierâ\\x80\\x99s cart as far as the school-house, and gathered in little knots in the porch, talk 172 ing of the storm and of the husbands and sons at sea. Very soon there was an increasing flow of arrivals, a clank of pattens in the girlsâ\\x80\\x99 room, which formed the waiting-room, and a smell of damp and woollens combined where Anne and Elsie, with four others to help them, were stationed behind the counters, measuring and reckoning to their heartsâ\\x80\\x99 content.THE SPRING- TIDE. As the day wore on, people dropped in: not so many as were accustomed to come when the weather was fine, but still a fair sprinkling of those who were glad of the opportunity of meeting their neighbours of all classes on two days of the year. Mr. Chambers drove his wife from the Hall, and came in, hale and hearty, with a kindly word for most of the women, and especially for the old ones who had known him ever since he was born. â\\x80\\x98Well, Betty, glad to see you able to come here.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99T is so much as I can do, Sir, I do assure you. What with rheumatics and the fall I got the other day, I was most obliged to give it up. But, there, I â\\x80\\x9911 come so long as I can. â\\x80\\x98 To be sure you will ! Why, Betty, donâ\\x80\\x99t you pretend to be getting old, when you look as fresh and young as if you were growing backwards.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah, Mr. Frank, you always would have your joke. But I donâ\\x80\\x99t complain ; for there canâ\\x80\\x99t be two forenoons in one day, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m thankful to be as I be.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s right. You canâ\\x80\\x99t get so far as the Hall, I know, so I shall come in to see you, and bring little Reggie, that you may see whether he is half as good-looking as his father was at his age.â\\x80\\x99 Of the sellers, Elsie was the most popular ; she looked her blithest and prettiest, enjoying herself without the drawback of shyness which was apt to afflict her when she found herself in the society of her equals. Anne declared that, when the bales were overlooked at the conclusion of the sale, the missing half 172 yards, which not unfrequently caused dire confusion among the accounts, might be laid to Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s door ; she would not be per 172 suaded that all her â\\x80\\x98 little bits over â\\x80\\x99 could mount to something really considerable. But, as I said, this added to her popularity. Mrs. Chambers stood in the middle of the room, talking to27Â§ ONE YEAR. Miss Villars in her easy, good-humoured fashion, feeling, it must he confessed, no great interest in the scene after the first ten minutes were over. She was a little weary of the village faces, and, before long, remembered to ask Miss Villars, with some eagerness, for the young French lady who lived at the Cottage, and had done them such good service the preceding evening. Miss Villars hesitated slightly in her answer. â\\x80\\x98Poor Ursule ! I wish she were here ; but I believe the girls scarcely thought she would enjoy such an affair as this.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ursuleâ\\x80\\x94is that Mademoiselle Lafonâ\\x80\\x99s name ? How delight 172 fully quaint and original ! I have always understood there was something quite romantic about the reason which induced Mrs. Blunt to leave the Cottage to her, but I have never been able to learn the rights of the story. She had never seen her, had she ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Never. But Mrs. Blunt was under some obligations to Miss Lafonâ\\x80\\x99s relations.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It did not seem quite fair upon her son, I acknowledge. At the same time, I am quite glad to know some one so fresh and different. How I wish she were here ! Her remarks would be too delightful. Miss Villars, I fully intended calling upon her in the course of the next day or two ; do you think I might venture to drive there now, and bring her back with me ?â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Chambersâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98 might I ventureâ\\x80\\x99 always appeared to put on one side the possibility of a negative. Miss Villars stammered and hesitated, and ended by saying she thought it would be a great kindness to the lonely girl. Bella, to her great mortification, had been unable to take any part in the conversation ; for Mr. Follaton had forgotten his spectacles, and she was obliged to stand by him and read the names on the cards as they were presented. She was astonished and vexed to see Mrs. Chambers drive awayTHE SPRING- TIDE. again so quickly; but more so to perceive her return, accom 172 panied by Ursule, bright and smiling, with eyes full of wonder at the scene. Mrs. Chambers was as proud of her as is a child of its new doll, watching her graceful, animated gestures with delight, and making her speak to all the people who might be said to represent the heads of the village. Ursule herself enjoyed it heartily. It seemed like a little piece of sunshine, after the steady gravity of the last few months, to have these people talking to her, smiling at her, as if they were pleased. She did not understand the social distinctions, or that Mrs. Chambers was a greater woman than Mrs. Chapman, the doc 172 torâ\\x80\\x99s wife : she liked them all, and was grateful to them for their notice. Every one was amused at her wonder and amusement over what seemed common-place enough to themselves : they found the old familiar things put before them in new lights, and began to think the originality was their own. It entertained them so much, that they scarcely noticed how every moment the wind gathered power, until two or three women came in breathless and wet, and a whisper went round that there were some fears about the tide that night, from the gale blowing south-east, directly on shore. Mr. Chambers did not let his wife linger after he realised the state of affairs. They drove Ursule back to the Cottage ; and Elsie and Anne, finding the storm was growing into such a hurricane that no fresh customers could reach the school-room, left the mistress to wind up matters, and started off themselves to the sea. They were hardy girls, brought up to be afraid of no weather, however rough ; and they loved dearly, when a fine sea was running, to watch it from a little off-lying hamlet, which went by the name of the harbour, and was chiefly inhabited by fishermenâ\\x80\\x99s families.28o ONE YEAR. The coast was backed by a ridge of hills of no great eleva 172 tion, but exquisitely beautiful in form and colouring. Numberless little streams rose among them, and made their way down through the valleys to the sea ; and one of these it was which originally attracted boatmen to its neighbourhood, and had gradually gained the name of harbour for the basin at its mouth. Nothing could be fairer than the valley through which it ran, with its field after field of rich emerald-hued grass, and red cows standing placid and content in their sweet, dewy pastures. Far away were the purple hills. On one side of the valley rose a steep, high bank, clothed to the very summit with fruit-trees, laden in turn with blossom and fruit, and half hiding the thatched white- walled cottages around which they grew. At the foot of the bank wound a narrow, muddy, picturesque lane, where ferns and water-cresses and water-spiders and water-rats ran riot ; where everything was green and luxuriant; where, on a hot summerâ\\x80\\x99s day, it was the most delicious thing in the world to sit on the grass bank between it and the stream, just at a certain point where the dog-wood gave place to an oak-tree, and a hurdle boundary was carried across the brook, and to listen to the cool, quiet babble of the water, and look over the green pastures to the blue hills and the bluer sky which shone serenely down between the oak leaves. Just where the brook reached the shore, the sea had formed for itself a sort of natural basin ; and the fishermen being much in want of shelter for their boats, the basin had been enlarged, and two or three embankments thrown out, together with a strong low pier, to break the force of the water. At high tide the basin was full ; when it was low, the channel of the stream was the only water where boats could float, and the others remained high and dry under the wall.THE SPRING- TIDE. 281 But between the country as I have described it above, and the view of it when the sisters reached the harbour, there was a terrific difference. The distant outlines were blotted out by heavy, wild-looking clouds ; bare, leafless trees shivered and bent beneath the tempest, as if mutely appealing for mercy; the cattle cowered under the hedges ; great waves dashed furiously against the wall, hurling drenching columns of spray into the air with what seemed an irresistible power. Already more than one gap was torn in the embankment, and a road was under water ; already three boats had been driven from their moorings, and were grinding against the wall. As Anne and Elsie turned the angle of the road which brought them within view of the angry waters, Anne was almost swept oft\\' her feet, and caught her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s arm. â\\x80\\x98 Elsie, it is impossible to stand ; we must go back.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, how beautiful ! Did you ever see such waves ! We are quite wet with spray even here. What shall we do ? I would not go back for the world. Look ! look ! the whole road is a sheet of water, and the tide not high yet. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it glorious ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 There is Mary Matthewsâ\\x80\\x99s cottage,â\\x80\\x99 suggested Anne, doubt 172 fully. â\\x80\\x98 We shall be wet through in five minutes, if we stay here.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, we might go there. I suppose she can let us out through the orchard at the back ; for see, Anne, the water has almost reached the walls. Now, run. Oh, what a pity it is that the others canâ\\x80\\x99t see it. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a tree blown down in the meadow.â\\x80\\x99 Mary Matthews opened the door to them with a scared face and vast astonishment. To her the sight was so much more dread 172 ful than beautiful, that she could not understand Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s excla 172 mations of delight over the great, fierce, thundering waves. She282 ONE YEAR. thought of the masters at sea, the women and the babies at home, and shook her head softly to herself over the girlâ\\x80\\x99s raptures. Her own husband lay at rest under the elms in St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s church 172 yard, but there were brothersâ\\x80\\x99 and sistersâ\\x80\\x99 lads out in the heart of those angry waters ; and, as she knew, after such a storm as thisâ\\x80\\x94such a storm as she never before remembered in all the long years she had lived in her old cottageâ\\x80\\x94there would be wild work among bigger vessels than sloops and trawlers. She shook her head and sighed, as Elsie clapped her hands, watching the tide creeping closer and closer to the door, and Tom Matthews bringing sods of turf to lay inside, and form what protection he could against its filling the kitchen. â\\x80\\x98 Hadnâ\\x80\\x99t you better go back, Miss Elsie ? â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98 I canâ\\x80\\x99t, Mary. Why, one may never see such a sight as this again in all oneâ\\x80\\x99s life. I should like to be standing out in it, and letting the spray break over one.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 They all knew where we were bound,â\\x80\\x99 said Anne. â\\x80\\x98 But, Elsie, it will very soon be growing dark, and then we must go at once, or Aunt Clare will really be frightened. You can let us out through the orchard behind, Mary, canâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, Miss, to be sure. Only take care as you pass the linhay; for I heard Tom say the slates was falling thick.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Anne, look ! Here comes a grand monster, capped and crested, and all ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What are those people collected for on the bank?â\\x80\\x99 said Anne, disregarding. â\\x80\\x98 Watching the poor boats, I suppose.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 They are not on the boat side : something has happened, I am sure ! See, they are stooping over the bank. Oh, Mary ! what can it be ? â\\x80\\x99THE SPRING- TIDE. 283 â\\x80\\x98 Well, Miss, I canâ\\x80\\x99t say, I am sure. Where they â\\x80\\x99re stand 172 ing is just where the brook runs under the road ; and I heard them telling that the sea had dug two or three holes right out of the road; so it may be something of that sort. However, there goes Tom, and wet to the skin he â\\x80\\x9911 get before he reaches them.â\\x80\\x99 They were making signs, Elsie said, breathlessly, her delight in the waves giving way to terror â\\x80\\x98 Anne, donâ\\x80\\x99t you think we might go ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You go, Miss Elsie? Youâ\\x80\\x99d never get there! Look at Tom, and see how heâ\\x80\\x99s obliged to hold on by the railings to keep out of the wash of the sea. Bless the boy ; I wish heâ\\x80\\x99d have stopped over here with me ! â\\x80\\x99 Elsie did not answer. She was watching Tom staggering along the road, holding down his head to avoid being blinded by the spray, and every now and then quite hidden in it. Anne had her eyes fixed upon the little group at the other end of the basin. â\\x80\\x98 There are five, and three of them are women. I am sure they are in distress about something.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is horrible to be so near and yet not to be able to do any 172 thing,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, walking about the little room, as if she found it impossible to sit still. â\\x80\\x98 Oh dear ! oh dear ! â\\x80\\x99 said Mary Matthews, wringing her hands, â\\x80\\x98 the waterâ\\x80\\x99s beginning to soak in. We shall have the kitchen full, and such a mess as there will be ! â\\x80\\x99 It was a relief to have something to do, and the girls helped to push sacking against the door, getting not a little wet in the process, but full of excitement. They resisted Mary Matthewsâ\\x80\\x99s entreaties that they would go home before the water spread more thoroughly over the floor, and climbed on the window-284 ONE YEAR. seat once more to look out between the leaves of lanky geraniums and fuchsias at the wild scene in front. The little ill-fitting casement rattled and shook with the fury of the wind ; clouds of spray were driven violently against it ; it was impossible to see clearly what was happening where the group of people were still gathered in the road. They could now and then make out figures running, beaten back by the wind, drenched by the sea ; but, what with the fading light, and the hurly-burly, and the spray, Mary Matthews could not so much as distinguish her son ; and their curiosity had almost ar 172 rived at an irrepressible pitch, when they caught a sound of a plash through the water, and a man passed the window, whom Elsie greeted with a violent rapping at the glass, and a glad cry of â\\x80\\x98 Clement, Clement ! â\\x80\\x99 He guessed why the door resisted his push, and came back to the window; but neither he nor his cousins could make each other hear, and it was impossible to attempt opening the win 172 dow. By dint of signs and pointing, however, Anne induced him to look round ; and he understood enough to start off im 172 mediately in Tomâ\\x80\\x99s track, watched by the sisters with great satisfaction. There was no danger in traversing the road round the basin, but a good deal of difficulty, from the tremendous force of the wind and the blinding power of the waves, which came with a mighty crash against the wall, and then leaped high above it and fell in a deluge across the road. Clement would scarcely have believed it possible that he should make so little way ; strong man as he was, there were moments when he could scarcely keep his footing; and never before had he so completely realised the terrific might of those rolling waves as when he saw what they could do even in this comparatively sheltered cove.THE SPRING- TIDE. 285 The proceedings of the knot of people at the other end puz 172 zled him even when he neared them sufficiently to be able to dis 172 tinguish better. They were standing just over the place where the little brook ran under the road into the sea, looking ap 172 parently into a hole in the road. A hole it was, as he made out in another minute or two; and Tom Matthews was half 172 way down it, working away with might and main ; but just as Clement reached the spot, he hoisted himself out with a vigorous effort, and stood disconsolately on one side, shaking his head in answer to the eager questions which poured upon him. It was almost the worst spot in the road. Every wave, as it struck the wall, poured over it. The women clinging to the rail 172 ing for support were drenched to the skin. One was crying bitterly ; the others giving what comfort they could. â\\x80\\x98 Her childâ\\x80\\x99s fallen into the hole, sir,â\\x80\\x99 said Tom Matthews in answer to Clementâ\\x80\\x99s eager inquiry, and making a sign over his shoulder in the motherâ\\x80\\x99s direction. â\\x80\\x98 Into the hole ? Surely you can soon get it out ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 So we thought, sir, and didnâ\\x80\\x99t try to get more help. But not one of us can move the poor little chap; his footâ\\x80\\x99s jammed into the grating.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Good Heavens ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Clement, looking in the hole ; â\\x80\\x98 in another few minutes â\\x80\\x99 He stopped suddenly. The mother had crept up to him and clutched his arm. â\\x80\\x98 You â\\x80\\x9911 save him, Mr. Clement,â\\x80\\x99 she said in a hoarse voice. â\\x80\\x98 You â\\x80\\x9911 save my poor little lad ? Fatherâ\\x80\\x99s awayâ\\x80\\x94he hasnâ\\x80\\x99t got no one but me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Save him? Yes, by Godâ\\x80\\x99s help. Tom, run to the black 172 smithâ\\x80\\x99s for a crow-bar. Any rope at hand ? â\\x80\\x99 There was none. They seemed to have believed that there286 ONE YEAR. was no difficulty whatever in rescuing the child, and to have been slow in finding out what was the reason that he screamed whenever they touched him, until he became too exhausted to do more than moan feebly. At the first instant Clement scarcely saw what had happened ; but now it was evident that the sea had ploughed a great hole in the road, and weakened the little arch under which the brook ran, so that a portion of it had fallen in. How the little boy tumbled in he had no means of knowing ; but he guessed at what was the truthâ\\x80\\x94that in stoop 172 ing over and peering in with his companions, the edge had broken away, and he had been unable to recover himself. The other children had run screaming home ; the mother and two or three friends had rushed out, and thought there would be little difficulty in extricating him. But the brook water flowed out through an iron grating, and presently it was discovered that his foot was wedged in some terrible way, so as to hold him fast, and prevent the possibility of dragging him up without stronger measures. Each person had laughed at the other, and thought they would be able to manage it better; and so valuable time had been consumed, and they were just awaken 172 ing to a perception that the force of the waves was so rapidly affecting the wall, that at any instant a breach might be made, and all hope destroyed. Not a moment was to be lost. Indeed, the danger was so imminent that Clement made the women stand in safety, before he lowered himself into the gaping hole. The waves, with a hungry roar, shook and battered at the wall, dragging away block after block of masonry and earth, and tossed angrily over the road to fall heavily into the pit. The boy was appa 172 rently senseless, for he neither moved nor cried. Do what he would, Clement could not prevent the earth breaking away at theTHE SPRING- TIDE. 287 sides with his weight, and rolling down upon the child. The actual aperture through to the rushing stream was smallâ\\x80\\x94 scarcely more than sufficient for the little foot to pass through ; but the very act of disentangling it from the grating might en 172 large it fatally, and cause the bridge to sink in. Clement realised the peril of his task, and set about it calmly and quietly, with one quick thought, which was, in truth, a prayer, and the remembrance that, after all, he was the best person to risk his life, since there were none left to depend upon him for any portion of their earthly happiness. â\\x80\\x98 Give me your necktie. Jack, quick !â\\x80\\x99 It was to knot to his own handkerchief, and to fasten round his arm, so that it would afford a slight assistance, in case of any violent slip, Jack lying on the ground, and stretching over the edge to hold it, but presently obliged to let go, when Clement, planting his feet as firmly as he could on either side, stooped low over the child, and cautiously passed his hand through the hole to feel the foot. He drew it back, disappointed, unable to reach so far. â\\x80\\x98Tomâ\\x80\\x99s brought the rope and the bar, sir.â\\x80\\x99 He had brought three men besides ; but it was impossible for more than one to be in the hole at the same time, since, even as it was, Clement felt as if all his efforts only increased the boyâ\\x80\\x99s danger. He could but tie the rope securely to both himself and little Phil, and then, again feeling for the grating, introduce the crowbar as gently as he could, and do his best to loosen it. He could see nothing; scarcely dared to use the necessary force for fear of the whole arch giving way, and for fear, also, of injuring the limb ; and was so cramped and stiff 172 ened by his position that his arm was almost powerless. Was the iron yielding? He felt a thrill of hope run through him,288 ONE YEAR. made a more tremendous effort, and the resistance gave way. Little Phil had opened his eyes, and was looking at him with half-unconscious wonder. Clement drew up the bar, put his arm round him, and called out, * Pull, my boy, pull ! â\\x80\\x99 There was a momentâ\\x80\\x99s struggle as the little fellow obeyed ; then he sank lowerâ\\x80\\x94a torrent of water rushed in from above ; a quantity of earth and stones rattled down. Clement saw, with horror, that the gaping hole was twice as large as before, and that only the support of the rope kept the child from falling through. He was becoming frightfully exhausted himself, but still this last misfortune gave him a better hope : he was now able to see the grating, although very dimly, and, if there was only time, he believed he could insert the crowbar in the right place. If! As he stooped lower and lower, he heard Tom Matthewsâ\\x80\\x99s voice above, hurried and hoarseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98For Godâ\\x80\\x99s sake, Sir, come up and leave him. The sea will be in in a minute ! â\\x80\\x99 It was the other peril which he had forgotten that now threatened fearfully. The waves were eating their way through. They tore out the great stones, and, rising higher every instant, it was plain that they might at any moment sweep away the road and the embankment together, and if Clement clung to the boy, he was lost. It all rushed into his mind. The wild longing for life leapt up ; but still he went on, feeling, groping, straining. The bar was in; the effort he made to move it was almost convulsive ; another, and another, with the deadly probability of what might come kept steadily before his mindâ\\x80\\x94 the ever-increasing likelihood that another second might see them buried in the falling earth, or swept away by the victorious waves. Again and again, Tom, at the peril of his life, stooped over to implore him to desist; and still he worked, until Tom,THE SPRING- TIDE. 289 through the roar of the wind and waves, heard a gasping cry to draw up, and, faint, weary, and exhausted, Clement clambered out of the hole, dragging the little boy after him. It was time. The men had not a moment to utter the cheer which was in their hearts, the mother had not reached her child, safe ground was barely gained, when a huge wave licked out a piece of the frail support that remained, and the sea broke completely through to the hole, and in a moment had made for itself a great gap, threatening the safety of the whole embankment, and driving the little group to seek a more secure standing-place. The mother was more taken up with making sure that little Phil was unhurt, than in thanking his deliverer ; but the others crowded round him with hearty words of approval. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99T was more than most would have done, to stick to the poor little chap when things were so far gone as they was,â\\x80\\x99 re 172 marked one of the men. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99T was what your father would have liked to have seen, Sir,â\\x80\\x99 said old Richard Andrews ; and Clement turned towards him with a glad, grateful look, as if the allusion had gone straight to his heart. â\\x80\\x98 Not one of you would have left him,â\\x80\\x99 he said, grasping a big rough hand, held out to him by a man who had known him from a child, and now looked him over with unmistakable pride and affection, although he and Clement had before now had some dispute about a poaching business. â\\x80\\x98 He isnâ\\x80\\x99t really hurt, is he ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, no, Sir,â\\x80\\x99 said one of the women he approached ; â\\x80\\x98 no thing to speak of : he may have got his ankle twisted a bit, and heâ\\x80\\x99s frightened and dazed, and no wonder ; but, bless you, he isnâ\\x80\\x99t hurt.â\\x80\\x99 192Ã\\x87O ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want the doctor ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Not he, Sir. His motherâ\\x80\\x99ll take him home and put him to bed. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the best thing for him.â\\x80\\x99 The women were in the ascendant now, feeling as if their participation in the fright and wetting had gained them a right to be heard ; and the men turned oft\" one by one to look at the mischief the storm was working. Clement followed to the door of Susan Blakeâ\\x80\\x99s cottage, that he might assure himself of little Philâ\\x80\\x99s welfare before he made his way as best he could across the meadows to his cousins. The boy was a little sturdy fellow, of about six years old, and he very soon began to revive into his ordinary self; his mother gradually, as the fright wore off, relieving her feelings by scolding him heartily for the adventure. Clement turned away with a sigh ; there seemed such an abso 172 lute absence of thankfulness or recognition of the Mercy which had given back her son. He could but hope that, when she was able calmly to reflect over all that happened, gratitude would spring up to Him who kept the waves by Plis decree. It was growing quite dark. He was wet through, and more exhausted than he liked to acknowledge. To get to the road on the other side of the fields, he was forced to make a con 172 siderable round ; for the water was deep in it, owing to the breach in the embankment ; and even then, since the tide was pouring down the road, and the water was two feet deep before Mary Matthewsâ\\x80\\x99s cottage, he had some difficulty in entering the latter from the back. He found his cousins fairly terrified by his absence. Elsie had made an attempt to follow him, but had been literally beaten back ; consequently, obliged to pass her time by endeavours to dry her clothes, with a great deal more water in the kitchen than was agreeable. Anne wasTHE SPRING- TIDE. growing very anxious to get home; Elsie, only bent upon knowing what had happened. â\\x80\\x98 What was it? Tell us, quick,-Clement ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It was a queer sort of accident. The sea dug a hole in the road, and little Phil Blake contrived to tumble into it, and get caught by the leg/ â\\x80\\x98 And who took him out ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Tom held the ropes; I pulled.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How sparing you are of your words, Clement ! Do tell us a little more. It is so dark I canâ\\x80\\x99t see you properly, but I fancy your face looks queer. Oh, and you are quite, quite wet ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, I am; so come along, let us go home as fast as we can.â\\x80\\x99 Only tell us just thisâ\\x80\\x94is he safe? and was what you did dangerous ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Dangerous ? pooh ! Mary, I donâ\\x80\\x99t half like leaving you alone here.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Matthews looked ruefully at her lime-ash floor, over which the water was slowly streaming. â\\x80\\x98If Iâ\\x80\\x99d a-known what was coming, I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have fagged my poor back with scrubbing it out yesterday.â\\x80\\x99 Anne was the only person who gave her any sympathy. Elsie was indignant at her want of perception of the beautiful ; and Clement was thinking whether there was danger to the cob walls of the cottage. He proposed that she should sleep at the Rectory ; but she repudiated the idea. The tide would be turning soon; Tom would be there in a minute or two; she should do well enough, and would be glad to think the young ladies were safe home. Evidently the best thing to be done was to follow her advice, as their long absence was likely to 19â\\x80\\x942292 ONE YEAR. cause much alanii ; and so they went out through a yard, and round an orchard, where the old apple-trees groaned and creaked under the force of the wind, until they reached the high road and comparative shelter. Until then, walking had been too hard.work for conversation to be possible, and Anneâ\\x80\\x99s voice sounded very breathless as she asked, â\\x80\\x98 How came you to know where we were, Clement ? or how came you to Elmwood at all ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98They talked, in DefForton, of a tremendous storm, and I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t resist the combined attractions of a south-east gale and a spring-tide. Then I met Miss Villars, returning in a depressed state of mind from that horribly fusty festival, your clothing- club ; and, finally, hearing that you had gone where I was going, I followed, and was told by Dick Summers that you were to be found at Mary Mathewsâ\\x80\\x99s. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the long and short of the matter.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It was very lucky for little Phil that you came,â\\x80\\x99 said Anne. â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, in rather a disappointed tone ; â\\x80\\x98 but I thought there was a real adventure going on, and it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to have been anything.â\\x80\\x99 Her cousin was silent for a minute or two ; then he said, in a low voice, â\\x80\\x98 I ought not to have made quite so light of it as I did to Anne just now. There was a good deal of danger about it, though no more than the other men would have faced readily, if they had had the chance ; and it was a very merciful escape. One ought to acknowledge it to others as well as oneself.â\\x80\\x99 Elsie could not help pressing his arm a little. She knew that Clement was reserved about his own feelings, and that to say what he had done was an effort to him She only ventured toTHE SPRING- TIDE. 293 whisper, â\\x80\\x98 We must all be very thankful ; â\\x80\\x99 and the cousins walked on silently. At the door of the Cottage, Clement stopped. â\\x80\\x98You will come on to the Rectory?â\\x80\\x99 said Anne. â\\x80\\x98Thank you, no. I shall get a bed here; and if you can manage this bit by yourselves, I begin to feel as if dry clothes would be a luxury. Besides, I did not see my aunt yesterday. You should have shown Mademoiselle Lafon the sea.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Clement ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She does not fall into our ways a bit.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Or you donâ\\x80\\x99t fall into hers ; which is it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, you canâ\\x80\\x99t expect us to do so,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, perversely. â\\x80\\x98 Certainly not. Ways is ways, as old Betty says ; and when youâ\\x80\\x99re in Turkey, you must do as the Turkeys do. May it never be your fate to find yourself out of that happy country ! It seems to me that you conservative people approve of no conservatism but your own.â\\x80\\x99 Elsie felt a little provoked, and went on defending herself. â\\x80\\x98 I am quite sure, Clement, that she would rather be left alone.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I should think so. It is not particularly pleasant to take the preliminary steps to friendship through a thorny thicket.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Friendship ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Is the thing out of the question ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You have never done much towards making us friends,â\\x80\\x99 re 172 torted Elsie, in desperation. Mr. Blunt felt himself silenced, and thought it better to end the conversation. â\\x80\\x98Weâ\\x80\\x99ll fight it out another day,â\\x80\\x99 he said; â\\x80\\x98the wind is just now stronger than arguments. Make haste home, children, or there will be a hue and cry after you.â\\x80\\x99294 ONE YEAR. Elsie went home dissatisfied. She did not like quarrelling with Clement at the very time when he had begun to fulfil her ideas of a hero, and she was puzzled with his displeasure. Or was he displeased ? What did he want ? A strange girl coming here, coming as an interloper, bringing her foreign ways to disturb themâ\\x80\\x94a girl to whom she was expected to talk French â\\x80\\x94how could she be more cordial than she had been ? Elsie had been inclined to take credit to herself for having ever spoken to her at all. She was not aware of the degree in which she intrenched herself behind an impenetrable fence of shyness, stiffness, and actual disagreeable manners; and her highest idea of any duty towards Ursule consisted in leaving her with 172 out molestation to her own society. If she and Anne had been more willing to be guided by Miss Villars, matters might have been upon a better footing ; but it was almost an impossibility to the latter to assert herself, and it was a sort of rule in the house that the girls should choose their own way in matters that were not absolutely matters of decided right and wrong. â\\x80\\x98 Bella likes Miss Lafon,â\\x80\\x99 Elsie would say, with a little contempt, as if it absolved her from any responsibility. Anne rested very much upon Elsie. She was more practical, and less imagina 172 tive, inclined to distrust her own judgment and to be guided by her sister, and afflicted with a self-consciousness of her own plainness and awkwardness, which made the society of strangers a complete penance, to be avoided in every practicable manner. Elsie was half angry, half sorry, over Clementâ\\x80\\x99s lecture. It was possible, however, that it might not be without its effect, since the last thing she said to Anne that night, in a very sleepy voice, was the remark, â\\x80\\x98 I wish Joyce was here ! â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER XVII. BELLA. The deeds we do, the words we say, Into still air they seem to fleetâ\\x80\\x94 We count them ever past ; But they shall lastâ\\x80\\x94 In the dread judgment they And we shall meet ! LYRA InNOCENTIUM. wind moderated during the night, and the morn 172 ing sun shone out clear and tranquil, as if all the violence of the preceding day had been a dream, water had forced its way in many places through the barriers which had for years restrained it ; part of the railway was washed away; two or three roads were impassable; the meadow nearest the harbour was flooded ; and people crowded down to see the worst gap of allâ\\x80\\x94the scene of little Philâ\\x80\\x99s rescue. But there was no turmoil now; the invading water looked like a beautiful lake, and smiled a serene welcome upon the spectators. Little Phil himself was playing and shouting with his companions at a safe distance from the treacherous hole ; the women who were to attend the second dayâ\\x80\\x99s clothing296 ONE YEAR. sale condoled with one another upon the long distance round which the breaking up of the road compelled them to walk ; Mary Matthews began disconsolately to scrub at the curved black line which marked the progress of the water in her kitchen. Everything looked much the same as ever, although the hamlet had just escaped a great danger, and old sailors shook their heads, and wondered what would have happened if the tide had run but another half-hour. Sarah had an especial talent for finding out, within a marvel 172 lously short space of time, what was done in the neighbourhood; and she was so proud of the report she was able to convey to Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, through Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s interpretation, of Clement having supported the bridge upon his shoulders, and dug out, apparently, nothing less than a whole school of boys, that Ursule, incredulous as she felt, would not hurt the old woman by laughing, and managed to report it, softened in detail, without breaking down. Clement himself came into the drawing-room in the morning, before starting, looking highly amused. She glanced at him, and ventured to say demurely, â\\x80\\x98You are not the worse for your exploits, I hope?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If I could do all that Sarah credits me with, I should scarcely be the worse for anything. I never expected to find myself on a level with the Seven Champions of Christendom.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It must have been brave, though ! â\\x80\\x99 Her eyes kindled, and she clasped her hands as she spoke ; and Clement was again struck with the expression of her face, which Louis loved to describe as beautiful, and which he had himself often called insignificant. â\\x80\\x98You will go and see the havoc the water has made?â\\x80\\x99 he said, after a pause.BELLA 297 â\\x80\\x98Yes, indeed; Jock and I are going by-and-bye, when we can be spared.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Mademoiselle Lafon, surely you might find a better com 172 panion than J ock ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Monsieur Blunt, I think not. We are the most excellent friends in the world.â\\x80\\x99 Another pause followed, and then Clement said, with that same little touch of irritation which seemed to be imminent whenever the subject was mooted, â\\x80\\x98The Rectory people would not be much flattered ! â\\x80\\x99 Ursule looked at him in surprise. Did he really not under 172 stand ? or was she expected to force an intimacy with his cousins ? She was out of patience with them all, cold, proud, and disagreeable as she haa found them ; and she only con 172 descended to answer by a little expressive shrug, which Mr. Blunt perfectly understood. â\\x80\\x98 Both Anne and Elsie have excellent qualities,â\\x80\\x99 he persisted. â\\x80\\x98 Excellent.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 They are thoroughly good girls. â\\x80\\x98 Without doubt.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And as to Miss Villars, she is all that is kind.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Indeed, she is,â\\x80\\x99 answered Ursule, with real warmth of tone. â\\x80\\x98Then why will you not like them better? Why not show friendship towards them ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Because,â\\x80\\x99 said she, turning round quickly, with eyes brimful of tearsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 because they think meâ\\x80\\x94they treat me as an enemy, as you all do,â\\x80\\x99 she went on, with a great sob that would not be controlled. â\\x80\\x98 You all hate me : you all wish that I had never come here ! I did not want your moneyâ\\x80\\x94your house. I was a hundred times happier in the old house, with my friends, than here in your cold, cheerless England, where the people are298 ONE YEAR like the skies, and have no sun in their hearts. I wish you would take it all again, and let me go ! â\\x80\\x99 She poured out the words with trembling eagerness, and Clement was struck dumb. There was so much truth in them, that he could not frame an answer. He was ashamed of him 172 selfâ\\x80\\x94ashamed of the want of generosity of which she accused himâ\\x80\\x94ashamed of the absolute unkindness which it must have required to open her eyes to the perception of her position. And, with it all, a great pity surged up in his heart for the lone 172 liness which at last had uttered a complaint. He did not know a twentieth part of the patience and forbearance she had been called upon to exercise ; but he no longer thought them impos 172 sible qualities for her. He turned away, and stood by the win 172 dow ; and when he looked round, Ursule was gone. Clementâ\\x80\\x99s exclamation was anything but romantic. â\\x80\\x98 Con 172 found it ! â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98what on earth is one to do?â\\x80\\x99 He walked moodily out of the house, along the road, into the station, pon 172 dering the question in his heart, and experiencing something of a manâ\\x80\\x99s provoked feeling when he has made arrangements for certain results, and the results fail. He had found fault with his cousins, it was true; but Mademoiselle Lafon had included him among her enemies. Nor could he help, with a sense of shame, acknowledging that in his thoughts he had treated her as a despoiler of his rights, and vaunted his own generosity towards her. It was very small, there was no deny 172 ing it ; and, if Clementâ\\x80\\x99s nature had not been generous at the core, the acknowledgment must have made him dislike Ursule more than ever. As it was, he felt bitterly that he must leave matters to right themselves. The Elmwood atmosphere might in time become more genial. â\\x80\\x98The sun does shine in our skies some 172 times, cold-hearted people though we be ! â\\x80\\x99 said he to himselfBELLA. 299 looking out of the carriage-window at the wintery meadows. â\\x80\\x98Poor girl ! I should not have guessed that there was much in that old Dieppe house ; but I suppose she had something she misses here, in spite of her change in position.â\\x80\\x99 And, oddly enough, the same thought came uppermost which Elsie had expressed the night beforeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98I wonder whether Joyce could do any good ? â\\x80\\x99 Ursule did not go to the harbour with Jock only, after all. Mrs. Chambers drove round forher, after the clothing-club sale was over, and took her to the spot where she could best understand what damage had been effected. Mrs. Chambers was not very clever, but she was very pleasant. She was a little addicted to sudden fits of friendship ; and, while they lasted, her good nature and kindness were unfailing : the reason they did not last was that, before long, she grew tired of them, and wanted variety. She was never unkind to her old favouritesâ\\x80\\x94only dropped them and forgot them. Ursule was thoroughly different from the other people about Elmwood, so that she threw every one else at once into the shade. Moreover, Mrs. Chambers talked French beautifully, and knew it ; and it was a pleasure to her to have so rare an opportunity of showing off her accomplishment. Meanwhile, Ursule herself was radiant. She expanded under the pleasant sunshine, and did not give a thought to its uncer 172 tainty, laughed and chatted, and found Mrs. Chambers full of admiration for her beautiful France, and far from being an adherent to the Rectory creed, that Elmwood was the most perfect place in the whole world. â\\x80\\x98 My dear child, they know no better,â\\x80\\x99 she said, laughing. â\\x80\\x98 They have such little hearts to think so ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I can quite understand how it strikes a stranger,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Chambers, with complacency ; â\\x80\\x98 and I am sorry you have de-300 ONE YEAR. rived your first experience of English life from Elmwood society. But you must go to London, and learn better.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I?â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, bewildered. â\\x80\\x98Oh, no; I shall never go away until â\\x80\\x99 She hesitated. â\\x80\\x98 Until when?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I was going to say, until I go backâ\\x80\\x94back to France. Some day, perhaps, if Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny can spare me, I shall go.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Chambers was just going to inquire about Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s home life, when an entanglement of the whip took off her attention. When that was set right, she asked, â\\x80\\x98 Do you see those houses on the hill ? 9 \\'â\\x80¢Lepetit village qui s\\'accuse V Ursule asked, smiling. â\\x80\\x98Yes, exactly; one sees it everywhere. My brotherâ\\x80\\x99s place is close to it. I must drive you there some day.â\\x80\\x99 It was by no means the first promise of the same kind. Ursule thanked her gratefully, and felt as if pleasant vistas were opening out before her. Mrs. Chambers laughed good- humouredly at Elsie and Anne, and touched their father and Miss Villars and all the Elmwood folk with a light, amusing vein of mockery, which was not ill-nature, and yet was apt to lower those upon whom it was exercised in the opinion of others. There was a worldly, frivolous tone about her ; and coming to Ursule veiled in the charm of kindness and interest, such as others denied, its danger was increased a hundredfold. Hers was not a character peculiarly susceptible of impressions of either kind ; but she was warm-hearted, and it was delightful to find some one on whom she could lavish a little affection after the repression she had lately taught herself; and Mrs. Chambers seemed ready to absorb it all, petting and praising her by light and delicate allusions, at which it was impossible to take offence.BELLA. 301 â\\x80\\x98 There are your people,â\\x80\\x99 she said, as they came in sight of the harbour, pointing with her whip to a group standing still in the middle of the road. â\\x80\\x98 Mine, Madame ? â\\x80\\x99 answered Ursule, with a little repudiating shrug. â\\x80\\x98 No, indeed ; I beg your pardon. But you will discover in time that the Rectory and the Cottage have always been looked upon as one. Just notice Anne. Was there ever such an un 172 gainly girl ? I can assure you that her coming out has been a serious trial to me ; it is so terrible to be obliged to invite her to oneâ\\x80\\x99s dinner-parties, and not even to have the satisfaction of supposing it a pleasure to herself, poor child. Elsie would be much better as far as appearances are concerned ; but she looks exactly like a frightened deer directly any one speaks five words to her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She is very pretty,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, sighing; for something about Elsie had made her yearn for a little friendliness from her. â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Chambers, meditatively ; â\\x80\\x98 I believe it would not be impossible to do something with Elsie. But I like Bella the best. There is not so much ground to get over in making her out. We will leave the carriage here, and walk to this won 172 derful hole, of which they talk so much, and of which Clement is the hero. By the way, I have not asked you yet how you like Clement.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule coloured so vividly with the remembrance of the morning, that Mrs. Chambers looked a little surprised ; but she only answered, quietly, that she scarcely knew. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny was very fond of him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah ! I dare say. Most old ladies are. My husband always stands up for Clement ; and I shall like him better when he has seen more of the world, and had the conceit taken out of him.â\\x80\\x99302 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Do you think him conceited, Madame ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Ursule, with astonishment. â\\x80\\x98 I think he has a very good opinion of Clement Blunt, Esq.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 He was so good to â\\x96\\xa0â\\x80\\x99 She stopped suddenly, with the feeling that, kind as her companion was, she could not speak to her about Louis. Mrs. Chambers did not heed her. They had reached the Follaton group, and she was making herself as pleasant to them as if she had not just now been taking off their little peculiarities. Ursule could not help smiling at Anneâ\\x80\\x99s evident consternation, and at the grunts which she forced herself to utter by way of reply. As to Mr. Follaton, shy as he was, he was too much absorbed in the subject of his researches, i.e., the action of the water upon the overthrown stones, to pay the least regard to Mrs. Chambersâ\\x80\\x99s bantering ; and it was as much as Elsie could do to prevent him from clambering down the hole in pursuit of some particularly favourable specimen. Bella was indignant beyond measure at the sight of Ursule on confi 172 dential terms with Mrs. Chambers, to the jeopardy of her own schemes for being driven about behind the pretty bay ponies. Miss Villars, with tears in her eyes, was describing what she had heard of Clementâ\\x80\\x99s conduct from one of the men who had been on the scene. From what he had said to the girls, they had no conception of the greatness of the peril. â\\x80\\x98 Brooks tells me he shall never forget his face when Susan Blake got hold of the child.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Would they have been actually killed ? One can scarcely realise it,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Chambers, looking into the hole, full of water and rubbish. â\\x80\\x98 Ah,â\\x80\\x99 Elsie said, â\\x80\\x98 now it is low water ; but, if you had seen it last night, you would have felt that nothing could escape which those waves once seized upon.â\\x80\\x99BELLA. 3Â°3 * Were you here ? â\\x80\\x99 Ursule ventured to inquire of Anne. â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Anne, in her shy, repellant manner. â\\x80\\x98And you saw it all?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, no. We were in that cottage. Oh, I beg your pardon !â\\x80\\x99 For, in her hurry to escape, Anne trod upon Mrs. Chambersâ\\x80\\x99s dress, and heard an ominous tear. The lady looked annoyed ; and Anne became crimson : she very nearly, in her bewilder 172 ment, stepped back into the hole ; but Bella caught her arm, produced a pin, and had done her best to repair the mischief before poor Anne recovered her composure. â\\x80\\x98And so,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Chambers, going back to the original subjectâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98so Clement Blunt is to be the hero of the day? As far as my experience goes, I do not think he will dislike the position. Well, Elsie, do not look fierce with those great eyes of yours, as if I had said a very cruel thing. Why should he not enjoy hero-worship as much as other mortals?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If you mean,â\\x80\\x99 Elsie said, steadily, though with an evident effort, â\\x80\\x98 that Clement will always feel glad and thankful when he remembers last night, I am sure you are right : we all feel it, donâ\\x80\\x99t we, Aunt Clare ? But as to caring about what people say of it, he will do no such thing ; he neither thinks of people nor their opinions,â\\x80\\x99 she added, with some scorn. Mrs. Chambers laughed. â\\x80\\x98 We all think of people, Elsieâ\\x80\\x94 even you,â\\x80\\x99 she said, lightly, â\\x80\\x98 however much you may profess to despise them. And why not ? Perhaps their admiration ma) r , on the whole, be as satisfactoiy a reward as seeing little Phil Blake grow up one of the idle good-for-nothing youths whom tny husband every now and then commits to jail. There, look at him now, fighting and howling as if he was on the high road to it ! â\\x80\\x99 Ursule bit her lip. Anne looked eagerly up; but she dared3Â°4 ONE YEAR. not answer Mrs. Chambers. To her great relief, a voice from behind said gravely, â\\x80\\x98 The question is not one of comparison between present and future. With that, man has nothing to do : it rests in higher hands. Whether Clement will derive the truest happiness from the remembrance that he has manfully tried to do his duty in the sight of God, or from the applause of his fellow-men, is the doubt ; and no one who has tested the two rewards will be per 172 plexed as to their respective value.â\\x80\\x99 Very seldom did Mr. Follaton listen or join in conversation in which he was not directly concerned. His words, spoken in a peculiarly sweet, distinct voice, made all the more impression from their unexpectedness. Anne looked relieved and satisfied ; Mrs. Chambers said, more gravely than was her wont, â\\x80\\x98 Thank you, Mr. Follaton. You have made me ashamed of myself. One does not keep those things before one as one should.â\\x80\\x99 The indefinite pronoun has convenient shoulders for bur 172 den-bearing; but Mrs. Chambers was sincere in her feeling, although she said â\\x80\\x98oneâ\\x80\\x99 instead of â\\x80\\x98I.â\\x80\\x99 As for Ursule, she felt as if she must always like Mr. Follaton after this. It had been inexpressibly painful to her to hear Clementâ\\x80\\x99s brave deed loweredâ\\x80\\x94degraded, as it was, by the tone of Mrs. Chambersâ\\x80\\x99s remarks. For the time she was inclined to detest her new friend, and to burst forth in his defence with Elsie. But Elsie showed plainly that she did not consider that she, a stranger, could have anything to do with the matter ; and Ursule found herself wondering, with a little vexed amusement, how long a time it took to be naturalized at Elmwood. She turned away with a sigh ; and Mrs. Chambersâ\\x80\\x99s frank speech won back her liking.BELLA. 305 Bright as the day was, and calm and beautiful the waters, the air was keen enough to make standing still for any length of time a chilly proceeding; and the party, with the exception of Mr. Follaton and his eldest daughter, walked back together to the place where Mrs. Chambersâ\\x80\\x99s pretty ponies were impatiently waiting for their mistressâ\\x80\\x99s return. Bella was next to her now, and she seized the opportunity. â\\x80\\x98 Anne and Elsie are going to Defforton to-morrow with papa,â\\x80\\x99 she said, disconsolately. â\\x80\\x98 And you are to be left alone ? Poor Bella, that is too ba^ ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 They are the two eldest, you see,â\\x80\\x99 said she, with a sigh. She did not think it necessary to explain that, having declared she could not bear all the dull visits papa intended to pay, Elsie had benevolently offered to endure them in her stead. â\\x80\\x98 I should make a fuss, if I were you,â\\x80\\x99 continued Mrs. Cham 172 bers, laughing. â\\x80\\x98 Do you mean they will not have you ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 We canâ\\x80\\x99t go three,â\\x80\\x99 replied Bella, silencing her conscience by the reflection that this was the truth, if not the whole truth. Mrs. Chambers was a good-natured woman, and liked to make people happy, when it could be achieved without cost to herself. â\\x80\\x98You shall drive with me to Ferncombe, if that will do as well,â\\x80\\x99 she said kindly. â\\x80\\x98 I can take Mademoiselle Lafon there another day.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, thank you ! That wall be delightful. I shall so enjoy those dear ponies and all. I canâ\\x80\\x99t tell you how much obliged I am.â\\x80\\x99 She was very much obliged. Mrs. Chambers was rather the grand lady of the neighbourhood ; Bella was of opinion that her sisters never made enough of her, and secretly resolved that, by the time she was a grown-up young lady, the intimacy should be on a more satisfactory footing between the Hall and 203Â°6 ONE YEAR. the Rectory. Intimacy with Mrs. Chambers meant dances and dinner-parties, and\\' picnics and croquet; possibly even, for prime favourites, a season in London. Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s eyes sparkled at the thought. Meanwhile, there was an untold delight m tasting the good things of the world, in driving in a well-appointed carriage, in being waited upon by men-servants, in enjoying the sense of luxury, in seeing the children run out from the cottages, and curtsy to Miss Bella in her exaltation. She could not bear the idea of being deprived of all this by Ursuleâ\\x80\\x94poor Ursuleâ\\x80\\x94 who again was to be looked upon as an interloper. Poorer Bella, who was suffering her heart to harden into selfishness ! Elsie had heard something of her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s conversation, and it pained her inexpressibly. She was so high-minded and truthful herself, that anything of deceit was, in her eyes, the most unpardonable of faults. She could not bring herself to think patiently of Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s pretended disappointmentâ\\x80\\x94of the victory she had gained. Directly the carriage had driven off, she looked at the culprit steadily with her clear, honest eyes, until Bella winced, and, going round to her auntâ\\x80\\x99s side, began talking rapidly, with the hope of shaking off Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s reproaches. But Miss Villars turned unexpectedly into a farm-house, and, before her niece could follow, she heard her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s low â\\x80\\x98 Bella ! â\\x80\\x99 with a whole world of indignation in the tone. There was no escape, and she faced round. â\\x80\\x98Well, what?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98How could you let Mrs. Chambers suppose that you were not allowed to go to Defforton ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And how could you do such a horridly mean thing as to listen ! â\\x80\\x99 answered Bella pettishly, trying to shift the blame. â\\x80\\x98 I never willingly listen to what I am not intended to hear. Oh, Bella ! I would have given a great deal not to have heard that!â\\x80\\x99BELLA. 3Â°7 For a moment, if she had but known it, she had made an impression. Her sister turned away her head ; but she did not answer, and Elsie grew more severe. â\\x80\\x98No one will trust you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I told no story,â\\x80\\x99 Bella said, sullenly. â\\x80\\x98 You acted one. You made Mrs. Chambers believe that you wanted to go to Defforton, that you were not allowed to go, and therefore you persuaded her to take you with her to-morrow.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be dictated to by you ! You are not papa, nor Aunt Clare, nor even Anne ; and you have no business to meddle with what does not concern you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Does not concern me ? Oh, Bella ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It does not. You are jealous of Mrs. Chambers liking me better than she does you, and so you say these spiteful things. I dare say you would like to publish them to Mrs. Chambers herself, if you had the chance.â\\x80\\x99 Elsie took no notice of the taunt ; it fell too harmless to touch her. â\\x80\\x98 I wish you would put me out of your head,â\\x80\\x99 she said, sadly, â\\x80\\x98 and think only of the right and wrong. Of course, I have no exact right to control you ; but even little Rose would have the right to protest against suchâ\\x80\\x94such absolute deceit.â\\x80\\x99 She said the word under her breath, as if ashamed to speak it. Bella only coloured angrily. â\\x80\\x98 I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be ordered by you,â\\x80\\x99 she began ; but her sister put up her hand, and stopped her. â\\x80\\x98 I am not ordering. I did not mean to seem to do so ; but I could notâ\\x80\\x94with a shadow of love in my heartâ\\x80\\x94hear what I heard, and not speak. I am not going to say any more, so do not let us quarrel. Aunt Clare is coming out.â\\x80\\x99 Bella felt a momentary pang ; Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s manner, more than her 20â\\x80\\x94a3Â°8 ONE YEAR. words, showed how deeply she was distressed. But the pang did not last. She thought to herself, that, whatever her sister might feel, she would say nothing to others; and if others did not know it, why then Bella did not very much care. She was a little bit shocked at herselfâ\\x80\\x94just a little ; she might have managed better, she thought, if only she had time. But, after all, it was not muchâ\\x80\\x94only a small equivocation : and Elsie and Anne were always so stupidly particular ; even in their childish games their word was a sacred thing, and the very shadow of a falsehood an impossibility. People were not like them. It was impossible to be so very precise. And so Bella comforted herself as she walked home in the quiet of a November twilight. When Ursule reached the Cottage, Mrs. Chambers kissed her kindly, promised to come again soon, promised to see Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, promised a dozen things which were all to be pleasant and bright, and drove away, leaving her in a state of enthusiasm over the coming of this little fairy, who seemed to be bent upon turning Elmwood into a bower of delight. Sarah, as she opened the door, stared at her young mistress in amaze 172 ment : she had never before seen the Ursule of a few months backâ\\x80\\x94the Ursule who used to stand at the head of the old staircase and tend the pigeonsâ\\x80\\x94the Ursule who had been a petted, wilful girl. The Mademoiselle Lafon she knew was different from these ; and it was no wonder that she was puzzled. She vented her feelings upon Bessie, whom she caught peeping from behind a baize door in the passage ; and Ursule, mean 172 while, ran merrily up the stairs to Madameâ\\x80\\x99s room. Madame was divided between two feelings. Even when it was given her at her own request, she invariably treated soli 172 tude as an affront; and,until that offence had been acknowledged, it would not do for her to display any interest in Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s pro-BELLA. 3Â°9 ceedings. On the other hand, she was thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Chambersâ\\x80\\x99s social standing among her neighbours, and quite aware that Sarah infused a little extra respect into her tone when she announced that the carriage was waiting ; and, in fact, was as well pleased as Ursule, although for diffe 172 rent reasons. Nevertheless, when the girl danced up to her sofa, bright and smiling, she looked so like her old self in the days when she used to quarrel defiantly with Madame, that the latter, who had never been so fond of her then as she was now, was seized with a sudden fear that the alteration was at an end, that she was no longer going to be submissive and gentle, that Mrs. Chambers had effected a transformation fatal to her peace. She closed her eyes, and lay back upon the cushions with an. air of suffering which went to Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s heart. â\\x80\\x98 Dear Madame ! â\\x80\\x99 she said, taking her hand quickly, â\\x80\\x98 you are in painâ\\x80\\x94you are worse ! â\\x80\\x99 As she received no answer, beyond a shake of the head, Ursule became really frightened. â\\x80\\x98 Sarah shall come,â\\x80\\x99 she said, hurrying towards the bell. â\\x80\\x98 Not that woman,â\\x80\\x99 answered Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny vigorously ; â\\x80\\x98 she understands nothing. She brings a bottle, which she says Madam Blunt gave to every one who was ill, and she stands over me, and expects me to drink it. FelicitÃ© had no nerves. Besides, child, I am not very much more ill than usual.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I am glad !â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, relieved. â\\x80\\x98 It is no wonder that the memory of my miseries becomes at times too oppressive. I am here, here in my old age, almost solitary. I have given up my country, my friends, the comforts of religion, everything, even to my very food, for your sake, child. Had it not been for my desire to advantage you by3 xo ONE YEAR. taking you to my cousins at Rouen, I should not have been as I am. Were it not for your advancement in life, I should not now be mewed up in this gloomy, foggy England, where they cannot even build their walls thick enough to keep out the sea.â\\x80\\x99 Madame honestly believed herself to be a victim, and Ursule looked puzzled. â\\x80\\x98 Would you really go back again ? â\\x80\\x99 she said. 1 Oh, how happy it would make me ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is too late,â\\x80\\x99 Madame said, solemnly. â\\x80\\x98 The journey would kill me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 There are your old rooms,â\\x80\\x99 Ursule went on eagerly. â\\x80\\x98 Tenez] she said, producing a letter from her pocket, â\\x80\\x98 this is what dear old Madame says :â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cYour rooms are empty, kept for you, my little one ; no one else shall have them. We are quite miserable, Sanson and I, to think of your being made to live with those English ; soon I shall be obliged to come and take you away. We all want you. The poor pigeons have not given up expecting you. I am obliged, in order to satisfy the creatures, to trot up all those weary stairs every morning, with crumbs in my pocket ; the neighbours stop me, and ask, â\\x80\\x98 Our little Ursule, when does she arrive?â\\x80\\x99 and what can I say? There is a stone in my heart when I think of you. Jules asks me to say that he has invented a sauce, the very queen of all sauces, and he has called it â\\x80\\x98 Sauce Ã\\xa0 lâ\\x80\\x99Ursule.â\\x80\\x99 It is quite a delicate little compliment, I assure you, as you will see when I send you the receipt. The oil, and the pepper, and all of which it is composed, represent qualities in your character. I did not know he had so much sentiment; but when he does speak, it is beautiful.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Ursule laughed, with eyes full of tears, as she folded up the letter. Madame shuddered.BELLA. â\\x80\\x98Those low people, the poultry-women and the fish-women, I suppose, call you â\\x80\\x9clittle Ursuleâ\\x80\\x9d? Pray, bum that letter, or do not breathe a word of it to your English friends.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But why not ? I am not ashamed, Madame ! They love meâ\\x80\\x94-those poor people.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 English ladies are proud, child ; they would not tolerate you in their society, if they believed you had acquaintances of that sort.â\\x80\\x99 Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes flashed. Â£ Do they not know that I am a poor girl in France ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98They know nothing about France; how should they? You are here under my protectionâ\\x80\\x94as FÃ©licitÃ©â\\x80\\x99s heir. That is enough.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then I am here under false pretences, Madame ! I will not remain so. If I stay in the country with these proud English, I will not forget my old self or my old friends. Oh, what are the new ones worth, that I should give up even old Nanette, the fish-woman, for them ? Poor kind Louisette at the farm ! â\\x80\\x99 added the girl, softening her voice, â\\x80\\x98 you are not a lady either, I sup 172 pose? I wonder if ever I should be so wicked as to forget you?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Do not be so excitable, Ursule,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, irritably. â\\x80\\x98No one wants you to forget them; but I suppose there is no particular reason for dragging them into the conver 172 sation, or for explaining that my friend Louisette lives at a farm-house and makes cheeses ? â\\x80\\x99 For a few moments Ursule was silent. â\\x80\\x98 No,â\\x80\\x99 she said, presently, in a low voice, â\\x80\\x98 if you had not told me what you have, I might never have thought about it ; but I cannot let them fancy me what I am not.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You will not tell them ! â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, with a little scream.3 12 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Why not ? I am not ashamed,â\\x80\\x99 Ursule repeated again, steadily. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, you dreadful child, you \"will kill me ! Have I no claim upon you, after all I have sufferedâ\\x80\\x94for you, for you, do you understand ? Do you wish to break my heart ? Yes, you do ; you wish me to die and be buried here, in this terrible country, and then you will send for old Nanette the fish-woman, and Jeanne, and Barbette, and live here with the friends you prefer. All my endeavours, all my patience, to teach you to be comme il faut to fail like this ! â\\x80\\x99 But Ursule was firmâ\\x80\\x94obstinate, stubborn, Madame said. The latter tried reproaches, coaxings, tears, in vain. She could not shake the girlâ\\x80\\x99s resolution to make known her real position in life; she began to fear that even the sweeping out of her own room would be revealed. In despair at last, and from sheer exhaustion, she was obliged to cease ; and then Ursule, troubled at her own hard-heartedness, devoted all her energies to amuse her, and to turn the subject. She described Mrs. Chambers for the twentieth time, the drive, the scenery ; she painted the spot where Clement had risked his life, and, in glowing colours, the old fisherman\\'s account of his courage and steadfastness. Madame listened, and forgot her wrongs. â\\x80\\x98 He is like my father,â\\x80\\x99 she said, enthusiastically ; â\\x80\\x98 as brave, only more determined.â\\x80\\x99 When the conversation showed signs of flagging, Ursule had lights brought her, and, fetching the newspaper, read until she saw that Madame was asleep, then went on in a low, mur 172 muring voice for a few minutes, so as not too suddenly to break the spell. Madame was, as she seemed to be, asleep ; but she had not been attending to the news of the day. Her last thought, with her eyes fixed upon Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s slight figure, slender throat, and well-balanced head, had been,BELLA. 313 â\\x80\\x98 She was beginning to make her wayâ\\x80\\x94that child ; and now this folly will ruin all.â\\x80\\x99 And Ursule, looking into the fire, whispered to herself, as she put down the paper, â\\x80\\x98 Oh, no ! Mrs. Chambers has too kind a face to be so cruel!â\\x80\\x99 Bella had her wish. She drove to Ferncombe the next day, behind the pretty ponies, and side by side with Mrs. Chambers. It was very pleasant. The deep, narrow lanes were sheltered from cold winds ; the hedges were scarcely less green than in summer, and what they lost in the vividness of one colour they gained in the bright scarlet berries and flaming leaves which flashed out from great holly bushes or straggling thorns. Hot tins for footstools ; soft furs for wraps ; overhead a cheerful, cloudless sun : she felt as if she must do her utmost to secure a continuance of such delightsâ\\x80\\x94as if less than ever could she endure to see others enjoying them at her cost. It was not long before Mrs. Chambers began to speak of Ursule. She praised her face, her dress, her manner, said she hoped to see a great deal of her, and thought it must be a great pleasure to the sisters to have so charming a companion at the Cottage\\'â\\x80\\x94the latter speech being good-naturedly intended to show that she thought they would do well to cultivate her acquaintance. â\\x80\\x98 I have seen more of her than any of the others,â\\x80\\x99 said Bella; but then, dear Mrs. Chambers, I am not so old as they are, and perhaps 1 donâ\\x80\\x99t think Anne and Elsie would be unkind for the world ; but, you see, she is so unaccustomed to society, they feel an awkwardness.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I dare say they do,â\\x80\\x99 thought Mrs. Chambers, with an inward smile at any want of society-knowledge proving an impediment in intercourse with the Miss Follatons. â\\x80\\x98 Donâ\\x80\\x99t you suppose3 X 4 ONE YEAR. then, Bella, that Mademoiselle Lafon has, in her way, seen as much of society as Anne and Elsie ? â\\x80\\x99 she asked aloud, a little contemptuously. Bella turned round with a gesture of astonishment. â\\x80\\x98 Ursula Lafon ? â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98 Why, you know who she was ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No. No great person, I dare say.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Why, she is nobody ! â\\x80\\x99 and finding that this startling designa 172 tion did not annihilate Mrs. Chambers, Bella continued, 1 She and her brother lived up in some horrid garret when Clement found them ; and then the brother died, and she had no one to stay with, so Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny brought her to England.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But Mrs. Blunt ? â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Chambers, a little staggered by this account, â\\x80\\x98 why did she leave her the Cottage ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, because she is the grand-daughter of an old nurse or some one. You know how odd Mrs. Blunt always was.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Stillâ\\x80\\x94who is her father ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 An artist, I believe.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, well, that is better ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98But only quite a low sort of manâ\\x80\\x94a dreadful man, a scoundrel â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My dear Bella ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is quite true : Clement was repeating it to Aunt Clare only a day or two ago. So, you see, she does not like us to be too intimate.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, indeed ! â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Chambers began to think she had made a mistake. Unfortunately, in more than one of her sudden friendships this had been the case, and she had met with a good deal of raillery from her relations in consequence. She was not desirous to add to the list. She was anything but indifferent to the worldâ\\x80\\x99s opinion, and, however she might have got over the garret andBELLA. 315 the poverty, the disreputable father was more than she could forgive. Happily, she thought, matters had not gone very far. She would write a note to Mademoiselle Lafon, excuse herself from keeping the engagement, and let the promised intimacy drop. It was a pity not to be able to have her at her parties, but it would not do : people would not stand it. â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s just as well to know those things/ was her only com 172 ment, as they reached the top of a hill ; and the ponies dashed merrily on towards Ferncombe. And Bella did not know whether she had succeeded or not.CHAPTER XVIII. MORE QUESTIONS THAN ONE. Let not what I cannot have My cheer of mind destroy. Colley Cibber. j.HE last traces of autumn, lingering long in those old weeks of such frost and snow as had not been experienced for many a year back. Instead of soft mud, the deep ruts in the lanes were iron-bound; snow covered up the ivy in the hollows of the hedges ; the trees were mapped out with strange distinctness against the grey sky. Little blue-faced boys raced home from school, with hands in their pockets, and scarlet comforters round their necks; or indulged in vigorous slides upon the frozen way-side pools. Bella had succeeded, and Mrs. Chambers had dropped Ur 172 sule. For days after the note postponing her promised drive, Ursule had waited and expected, and soothed Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny with a hundred reasons for the delay ; but, by-and-bye, when the pony-carriage dashed past her in the road without stopping, when neither note, nor invitation, nor sign of any kind cameClement at the Cottage, P-.V7MORE QUESTIONS THAN ONE. 3\\'7 from the Hall, she understood that all her pleasant visions were to be put on one side and done with. It is very hard for those who are ready to believe that kindness will be perpetual to receive a check of this sort ; and although Madameâ\\x80\\x99s conversa 172 tion had, in some degree, prepared her for it, she was bitterly disappointed : perhaps she might have felt it even more, had not Madameâ\\x80\\x99s own vexation been extreme. Ursule was obliged to treat it lightly with her, to laugh it off, not to allow her to guess at her feelings, until by degrees she ceased to feel the sting herself. She had no shame about the matterâ\\x80\\x94she had done nothing wrong : she put her pleasant little dreams upon the shelf, and made herself happy as best she could. When she met Mrs. Chambers, the latter had always a gracious smile and bow, which Ursule was soon able to return without one envious prick at the sight of Bella sitting triumphantly in her place of honour. Her disposition was too buoyant and too active for her solitary life to make her melancholy. Jock, with his great faithful eyes and rough caresses, was her constant companion when she was out of doors ; at home she read, taught herself to draw with an ease and rapidity which astonished herself, knitted a shawl as large as a counterpane for Madame Sanson, read the newspaper to Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, and, in the evening, played b\\'eziqtie untiringly. About Christmas, Clement came for a few days, and, whether he was smitten with com 172 punction at the thought of his past harsh judgments, or whether the genial season affected him charitably, he was certainly kind to Ursule, took trouble to amuse her, and made her thoroughly happy. In Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s roomâ\\x80\\x94the bed curtained off by day, and the room made to look as bright and pretty as possible, she herself never so smiling and uncomplaining as before her nephewâ\\x80\\x94the three made a cosier party than UrsuleONE YEAR. had ever believed would have been possible ; and, on her part, she was careful to put no hindrances in the way. She said nothing to show that the Rectory sisters still held aloof; she made no objection to go there; she suffered no manifestations of dislike to appear. Clement thought with satisfaction that matters were improving, but he was not so blind as to believe that they had reached perfection. He still hankered after Joyce and her brisk genial influence, and, finding himself obliged to go to London in the midst of the severe weather above men 172 tioned, he had little difficulty in obtaining a renewal of the invitation to Joyce in Miss Villarsâ\\x80\\x99s most pressing words. This time he was careful to specify the hour of his intended arrival ; but the snow had drifted so deeply over a portion of the line, and the rails were so slippery, that the train was long delayed, and it was quite dark before he drove up to New Terrace. Mr. Clayton came to the door to welcome him, and Mrs. Clayton waited, quietly happy, in the drawing-room ; but Joyce, generally foremost in her greeting, was not there, and his first inquiry was for her. Mr. Claytonâ\\x80\\x99s pleasant face grew a little grave as he answered, â\\x80\\x98Not in yet. I expect her presently.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Not in? Why it is pitch dark ! Does she tramp about at this hour ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98She will not be alone; Miss Fosterâ\\x80\\x99s maid will walk home with her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Is that the funny little old woman, who goes along sideways and weeps? What has made Joyce take up with her?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She has a little nephew with her, very ill.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I see ! Joyce is helping to nurse. Just like her.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton made no answer ; and Clement fancied some 172 thing was not quite right. However, he had asked questionsMORE QUESTIONS THAN ONE. 319 enough for even his relationship with the house, and he yielded the next batch to Mrs. Clayton. They were very much the same as she had put to him in the summerâ\\x80\\x94the â\\x80\\x98 hows â\\x80\\x99 and the â\\x80\\x98 wheres â\\x80\\x99 which attend family greetingsâ\\x80\\x94the growth of her niecesâ\\x80\\x94the health of her brother ; but there was also a blank and a change : his mother gone, his home taken from him, his aunt and Mademoiselle Lafon installed there in his place. Mrs. Clayton hesitated and flushed ; but she could seldom keep back anything which had reached, as she said, the tip of her tongue, and she burst out, in spite of her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s warning glance, â\\x80\\x98 My dear Clement, I know I ought not to say it, only it does seem so hard for you. That dear, pretty, old Cottage that you were so fond of ; and your mother of all people in the world ! It is so dreadfully hard ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Thank you,â\\x80\\x99 said he, sitting down by her easy chair ; â\\x80\\x98 but the hardship ought not to be one, at all events. For the sake of my profession, I could not have lived on at Elmwood alone ; and, after all, who is so proper a person to be there as my aunt ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But that designing girl ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Poor Ursule ! â\\x80\\x99 said Clement, sadly. â\\x80\\x98 Among all her sins, that is a new one to lay to her charge. I think her worst enemy must acquit her of design in the matter ; and, if her own wishes were to be consulted, I begin to believe she would gladly throw the whole thing into the sea, and set off for her own country.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then let her restore it.â\\x80\\x99 Clement reddened. â\\x80\\x98You are dealing with impossibilities, Mrs. Clayton,â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, you men are sohigh-flown ! â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Clayton had been roused into excitement, but with her it could not last long, and320 ONE YEAR. in a moment or two she subsided into her usual placidity. â\\x80\\x98Ah, well,â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98I dare say the poor girl is out of her element.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 As completely as a salamander in a trout stream ; or a trout among salamanders would perhaps be the better simile. Our minds are not quite made up whether she will bite, or whether we shall bite her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 An amiable community, upon my word,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Clayton, laughing ; â\\x80\\x98 and a pleasant sort of Christmas you must all have spent together ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Delightfully seasonable, I assure you. And the long and the short of the matter,â\\x80\\x99 continued Clement, becoming serious, â\\x80\\x98 is that we all think we should be the better for Joyce coming to see us, andâ\\x80\\x94well, perhaps, shaking us all together until she has made us agreeâ\\x80\\x94wrung a little harmony out of us as if we were the harmonium class.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Joyce is looking exceedingly ill; that is all I can say,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Clayton in an injured tone. â\\x80\\x98 Mr. Clayton, you must not say â\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d this time.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I did not say â\\x80\\x9c no â\\x80\\x9d last time.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, then, you must say â\\x80\\x9cyes.â\\x80\\x9d Where is Joyce? I wish she would be quick and decide while I have you in the yielding mood.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I think I heard the door open. Yes ; that is her step.â\\x80\\x99 It was a very slow one, and unlike her usual mode of mount 172 ing the stairs, as her cousin could not help thinking, particularly when he was waiting for her after so long an absence. She came into the room, looking pale andweaiy; and though her greeting was warm, it was spiritless, and made with something of an effort. As soon as she could, she turned to her father. â\\x80\\x98Well, my dear?â\\x80\\x99 he asked.MORE QUESTIONS THAN ONE 321 â\\x80\\x98Just the same; not the slightest change, that we can see.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The same delirium ? â\\x80\\x99 1 Yesâ\\x80\\x94in and out. Perhaps the intervals of stupor are longer.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Shall.I go again to-night?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, thank you, papa,â\\x80\\x99 she said, gratefully ; â\\x80\\x98 there is no occa 172 sion for it. You will only distress Miss Foster. She is very much shocked at the idea of your going out at such untimely hours.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And who sits up to-night ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Lydia : she is behaving admirably. That was another of my mistakes,â\\x80\\x99 she said, sadly. â\\x80\\x98Yes, Joyce,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Clayton, gravely; â\\x80\\x98but, thank God, our mistakes are often overruled.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Papa, I wanted terribly to stay.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I never heard such an idea,â\\x80\\x99 interposed her mother. â\\x80\\x98 And with Clement here, too ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What is the meaning of it all ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Mr. Blunt. â\\x80\\x98 Who is this little boy, in whom you are so much interested ? â\\x80\\x99 Joyce was silent. Her father answered for her. â\\x80\\x98 He is a little nephew of Miss Foster. His father and mother are in India ; and this child was put under her care. She sent him to school, and, while there, he was seized with what seems to be a sort of low nervous fever. Of course, the responsi 172 bility adds tenfold to the anxiety.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Of course, poor little fellow ! But, J oyce, you are not to be turned into a parish nurse. Do you know what I have come prepared to do ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 To carry you back to Elmwood. Hallo ! â\\x80\\x99 as he caught the startled glance at her father, and the imploring expression of her countenance. â\\x80\\x98 Wonâ\\x80\\x99t you come ? â\\x80\\x99 213 22 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98My dear Joyce, it will be the best possible thing for you. I shall insist upon it,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Clayton, with unwonted deter 172 mination. â\\x80\\x98 Not now; pray, not yet/ faltered Joyce. â\\x80\\x98 Yes, indeed. We have quite as much work cut out for you as even the most active mind can desire. You shall hear all about it by-and-bye. Meanwhile, I have obtained Mr. and Mrs. Claytonâ\\x80\\x99s full leave and permission.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Papa !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I think it will be as well, Joyce. You are getting, as your mother says, terribly overwrought ; and Clementâ\\x80\\x99s escort would be a good opportunity for your going to your uncleâ\\x80\\x99s. It will not be for a week yet. We donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to let him go before ; and there is no reason to suppose that you cannot then be spared.â\\x80\\x99 She made no answer ; and Clement wondered again what was the matter. The Joyce of old days would have argued and battled good-humouredly, but none the less determinedly, and would probably have carried the day. Mr. Clayton, however, seemed desirous to change the subject : he plunged into a political question, which he and Clement were able to discuss alone ; while Mrs. Clayton dozed peacefully in her easy chair, and Joyce worked at intervals, and at intervals let her work fall listlessly in her lap in a strange absent manner, still more unlike herself than all which Clement had noticed before. In the morning, when he had exerted himself, much against the grain, to face the dark dreariness of a London winter morn 172 ing, and to arrive down-stairs in time for the half-past eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock breakfast, he met Joyce in the passage, just coming inâ\\x80\\x94 the same weary, restless look upon her face as had saddened it the preceding evening.MORE QUESTIONS THAN ONE. 323 â\\x80\\x98 So early ? â\\x80\\x99 he said, taking her hand kindly. â\\x80\\x98 Joyce, your father is right ; you are allowing yourself to be overwrought.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You would not wonder, if you heard,â\\x80\\x99 she said, hurriedly. â\\x80\\x98Well, never mind; I wonâ\\x80\\x99t tease you. Where have you been ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 To Miss Fosterâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And the boy ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No change. Let me go, Clement. There is the bell for prayers.â\\x80\\x99 He looked after her wonderingly. His bright, genial little cousin was sadly altered. For the first time he found himself comparing her with Ursule, and remembering, with a certain pleasure, the soft frank expression in the French girlâ\\x80\\x99s eyesâ\\x80\\x94 her pretty caressing ways with Madame. He began to lose faith in Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s power of helping them; and the two servants, coming up in obedience to the bell, found Mr. Blunt standing in a reverie, with his hand upon the handle of the dining-room door. He secured Joyce after breakfast, although it seemed to him that she looked wistfully after her father as he left the house, and only remained in obedience to his â\\x80\\x98You will stay with Clement, my dear?â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Clayton descended to the lower regions, and the cousins found themselves alone in the drawing 172 room. The day was gloomy, and bitterly cold ; grimy snow lay in cold corners, drifted against chimney-stacks or under door 172 stepsâ\\x80\\x94iron railings stood out in black severity before the houses they guardedâ\\x80\\x94poor little dingy sparrows puffed out their feathers, and chirped forlornly over their miseries. Joyce shivered as she stood at the window, pressing her face against the glass, and watching her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s tall figure as long 21 2 j3 2 4 ONE YEAR. as he continued in sight. Clement felt half provoked at her absorption. â\\x80\\x98Ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock,â\\x80\\x99 she said, looking at her watch. â\\x80\\x98Papa will just catch the doctor.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What on earth makes you all so anxious about this child ? There must be plenty of other boys ill in the district. Is he an especial favourite ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 He was not, particularly.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, then, poor little Miss Fosterâ\\x80\\x94I rather think, Joyce, that you used to bully her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 she said ; and, to Clementâ\\x80\\x99s amazement, he saw tears in his cousinâ\\x80\\x99s brown eyes. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x94I beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x99 he began, confusedly, when she stopped him. â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t wonder you are puzzled ; but I will tell you the story, and you will not be surprised at my anxiety. You know what papa said about little Harry. His father and mother are poor, and in India ; and Miss Foster offered to take the entire charge of this boyâ\\x80\\x94he came very soon after you were here in the summerâ\\x80\\x94educate him, do everything for him, in fact. It was very noble of her ; for she had to save and stint herself in every possible way, which it used to make me angry to see. I did not think it was fair that she should be saddled with such an expense. Then he was exceedingly troublesome, delicate as he was, indolent, and overbearingâ\\x80\\x94not a bit what a boy of his age is generally like; altogether a dreadful care, and, I fancied, likely only to be more spoilt under Miss Fosterâ\\x80\\x99s training.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, Joyce, I acknowledge the spirit of discipline does not appear to me to dwell in the folds of Miss Fosterâ\\x80\\x99s petticoats.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No,â\\x80\\x99 she said, with a faint smile : â\\x80\\x98so I continually urged her to send him to school. I am sure I made her very un-MORE QUESTIONS THAN ONE. 325 happy, because she thought him too delicate for it ; and yetâ\\x80\\x94 yet she distrusted her own judgment, and fancied I might be right ; so, between one thing and the other, she had no peace. She used to fall back upon the expense, say she could not afford it, and would not send him to a second-rate school. Then she wanted to try a tiny one close at hand, kept by two ladies ; but I thought that would be no better than home, and I went on persuading and entreating, until at last an old uncle came to see the boy, and vehemently applauded all I said, concluding with offering to pay half his school expenses.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well ? â\\x80\\x99 Clement asked kindly, guessing what was to follow. â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 repeated Joyce, bitterlyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98well, I had my way; and do you want to know what came of it ? He went to school at Michaelmas : he was miserable, wretched ; but I persuaded Miss Foster that it was no more than what every boy experi 172 enced. Finally, a week before the Christmas holidays, he broke down altogether. She went to fetch him, brought him home, and he has lain at deathâ\\x80\\x99s door ever since. Oh, Clement, those Indian letters break my heart ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You suggested what you thought would have been the best thing ? â\\x80\\x99 he said, hesitatingly, wishing to comfort her. â\\x80\\x98 What I thought ! Yes ; that is just it. I would not rest until she had done what I thought best. And it was to me that the doctor said, the first day that he was called in, â\\x80\\x9c Such a delicate boy, Miss Clayton, ought never to have been sent to school.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Poor Joyce!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Clement, one thing. Pray, pray, do not press my going back with you. My one, only comfort is to be on the spotâ\\x80\\x94 to do what I can ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Is there likely to be a change soon ? â\\x80\\x99326 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98We do not know. Yes, I suppose so. He cannot go on much longer as he is at present.â\\x80\\x99 She spoke in a tone of such utter wretchedness that Clement was shocked. â\\x80\\x98 My dear,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t wonder at it ; but you are working yourself into a morbid fancy that there is only a black side to be looked forâ\\x80\\x94a very unwholesome, unwarrantable state of mind, let me tell you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You would feel as I do, if you saw Miss Foster.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, Joyce, she is always, and at the best, a little depress 172 ing, to say the least of it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Please, donâ\\x80\\x99t laugh at her. Her patience and her goodness have been something wonderful. If you knew how many times she has put me to shame ! â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Clayton came in, and the conversation dropped. Cle 172 ment had business to occupy him throughout the day, and did not return to New Terrace until dark. He found them all in the drawing-room, and Joyce tried to talk about in 172 different things, and to be cheerful, but with an evident effort, and want of her old facility for throwing herself heartily into whatever subject came uppermost, which it pained him to ob 172 serve. He could see, too, that she was altered, and, as her mother said, looked ill ; her bright healthy face was worn, and there were dark shadows under her eyes which he had never noticed there before. He said so to Mr. Clayton, when the gentlemen were alone after dinner. â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said her father, gravely, â\\x80\\x98 my poor little Joyce is having a sharp lesson. She has accepted it so thoroughly that I have great hope of its effect.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98How is the child to-day?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is almost impossible to say ; but my own impression is aMORE QUESTIONS THAN ONE. 327 little more favourable. The delirium and the restlessness seem to have passed away, and there is no longer that dim redness of the eyes which has hitherto been a marked feature. Still, he lies in a stupor, and of course there is very great danger of his not having strength to rally ; or another danger, of which Joyce is unconsciousâ\\x80\\x94that his brain may be affected.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How much she feels it ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98If she were not Joyce, I should be inclined to say, too much ; but, even should the worst that she anticipates come to pass, hers is too active a mind to become morbid and self- worrying. It will dim her spirit for a time ; but I believe in any case this trial must end in good for her, were it only in teaching her to judge charitably, and not to despise what does not in all respects come up to her standard.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 While she is in such anxiety, it wonâ\\x80\\x99t do, I expect, for me to say much about taking her back to Elmwood. It would be cruel to drag her away.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton got up, and walked to the fire. â\\x80\\x98 It would be better for her to go, cruel as it does seem, Clement. She is of no real use to Miss Foster, who has turned out a first-rate nurse ; and this continual running backwards and forwards does no good, although I confess I am not sufficiently stern to do more than check it. I am afraid she will not be a very comfortable visitor ; but I am sure she would benefit herself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Then I leave it in your hands, for Joyce would think me a traitor if I pressed it after what she said to me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And about yourself? Life in lodgings is but dreary work ; do you find it better than the rest of the world ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I get on well enough; but home life seems very enjoyable when one does get a peep of itâ\\x80\\x94such home life as this, I mean, where you donâ\\x80\\x99t shut out outer interests.â\\x80\\x99328 ONE YEAR Hum ! In London one can scarcely lay claim to that as a virtue.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The Rectory tribe are growing every year more clannish and narrow-minded. Just because poor Mademoiselle Lafon hap 172 pens to be French, they avoid her as if she had the plague.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Is there anything about her to justify their treatment?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Nothingâ\\x80\\x94nothing at all !â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Clement warmly. â\\x80\\x98 On the contrary, they would all be the better for her society,â\\x80\\x99 con 172 tinued he, with sublime forgetfulness of his original notions on the subject. â\\x80\\x98 Indeed ? â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Clayton, smiling. â\\x80\\x98 Her conduct to my aunt is beyond praise.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Really ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am quite sure you and Mrs. Clayton would like her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am quite sure we would try to do so,â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton said, earnestly. But Clement noticed neither the smile nor the earnestness: he was silent for many minutes; and when he looked up, it was to talk of quite a different matter. That evening, when Mr. Clayton was alone with his wife, he said, â\\x80\\x98 Emily, I have a prophecy to make, of the kind after your own heart.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What ? Is anything going to happen ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Remember that, so far, it has got no lower than the clouds ; but there I see a shadow of Clementâ\\x80\\x99s forthcoming marriage â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Clement ! With whom ? Let me guessâ\\x80\\x94Joyce ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Joyce!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Mr. Clayton, startled out of his playful 172 nessâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Joyce ! My dear, are you dreaming?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98They are very fond of each other, and I fancied Well, if it is not she,â\\x80\\x99 she said, a little disappointedly, â\\x80\\x98 who can it be ? Elsie ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Stop a moment, wife. I canâ\\x80\\x99t get over that idea of yoursMORE QUESTIONS THAN ONE. about Joyce. Surely you do not suppose for a moment that she â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Surely you do not mean to say this is the first time the idea has crossed your mind ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Indeed, it is.â\\x80\\x99 * Well, men are the strangest creatures ! I have always felt it a possibility, with the two so much thrown together.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She has been a child.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Clayton, sighing ; â\\x80\\x98Joyce was never very young.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Still,â\\x80\\x99 continued her husband, disturbed, â\\x80\\x98 it has been nothing more than an idea of yours ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, no, nothing more : only when you talked of having guessed something, I fancied it must be this. Fond as I am of Clement, I am not sorry, on the whole, if it is not as I sus 172 pected ; but, if not, who is it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know that I ought to blame you for unreasonable conclusions, when my own have such slight foundations ; but, I confess, my suspicions point to Mademoiselle Lafon.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Mademoiselle Lafon ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Clayton, with a little scream of horror. â\\x80\\x98 Why not ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 His lettersâ\\x80\\x94all their letters : nobody says anything nice of her ; she must be altogether unsuited ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. They are vain men who marry their doubles, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t think Clement vain.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I canâ\\x80\\x99t believe it, said Mrs. Clayton, decidedly. â\\x80\\x98When I began, I told you it was only in the clouds. No 172 body is called upon to put faith in such shadowy possibilities.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 A French girl ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Undoubtedly.â\\x80\\x9933Â° ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Beneath him in birth ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Decidedly.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, to be sure, Clement is half French himself, andâ\\x80\\x94after all, her father seems to be a good artist.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton smiled. He knew that his wife had turned the corner. â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t think any one has said actual harm of her?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, indeed.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And, Reginald, donâ\\x80\\x99t you see ?â\\x80\\x94oh, that is delightful !â\\x80\\x94 Clement has only to marry her to have his own back again.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Right, O most far-seeing woman ! Then, you give your consent ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I think, really, it is the very best thing he can do. I never could bear to think of his being turned out of it, and that slice taken away from his income. It is much the best thing he can do.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Only, remember, it is the vaguest dream, on no account to be alluded to.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Clayton nodded serenely, perfectly satisfied with the arrangement she saw before her. Her husband would have been less easy had he not believed his wife to have been misled by a feminine capacity for suggesting probable marriages. â\\x80\\x98Joyce !â\\x80\\x94pooh ! â\\x80\\x99 he said to himself, half angrily. â\\x80\\x98 If I thought there was a shadow of foundation for it, Elmwood is the last place she should visit. But it is impossibleâ\\x80\\x94absolutely im 172 possible ! â\\x80\\x99 Joyce received the news that she was to go very quietly. If she had pleaded very strongly, her father would have yielded ; and she knew it. As it was, it went to his heart to see her eyes fill with tearsâ\\x80\\x94rare symptoms of emotion for her at any timeâ\\x80\\x94and to notice that she did not attempt to put aside hisMORE QUESTIONS THAN ONE. decision. She could be very resolute when there was occasion for it, and her resolution now was not to seek her own will. It seemed to her as if she could scarcely endure to go away out of reach of Miss Fosterâ\\x80\\x99s house, out of reach of the almost hourly bulletins which were both her comfort and her torture, and, at the first hint of such departure, she had cried out against it. But the very strength of the feeling made her fear it. Was she not reaping the fruit of that love of control, that desire that her own will should be followed, which had grown up with her since the time she had been a little childâ\\x80\\x94grown with her growth, strengthened with her strength, and now, in its very fulfilment, had become its own punishment ? All her plansâ\\x80\\x94 what were they but the craving for power ? All her active use 172 fulnessâ\\x80\\x94was it not sweet to her from the belief that no one else could carry it out as carefully, as thoroughly, as she ? It swept over her as the conviction of a fault does sweep over us when we have shut our eyes to warnings, refused to take them home and look them in the face, and then suddenly awake to find the fault standing over us, full-grown, strong, and its own avenger. There is a danger in all hours of reaction. â\\x80\\x98 To have a right judgment in all things â\\x80\\x99 is the prayer we need especially to use when, in seeing the errors of the path we have trodden, we are inclined altogether to distrust the path, and to turn away from all that reminds us of our failures, even though it be from good itself. It is so in the history of nations, in the history of the Church, in the history of ourselves. Joyce longed to throw down her undertakings, and to leave all that she had begun in the hands of others ; and it was well for her that her father was watching now, as he had been watching while she was uncon 172 scious, and was ready with good help when most she needed it. He said little, but she knew he sympathized with her, so that332 ONE YEAR. she clung eagerly to any words of advice he let drop. He would not let her neglect her schools, her district, her singing- class, though her present inclination was to give them all up. But he thought within himself that it would be good for her to go away, so as to cause a break in the too great accumulation of duties she had heaped about her, believing that, when she came back, she might take up her home-life again, in a wiser and more humble spirit. The long-continued frost at last gave place to a thaw, which, for a day or two, made London more wretched than ever. Moody skaters walked home disconsolately, one day, from the Serpentine, which showed unmistakable signs of returning to its ordinary condition ; and from that time there was no return of frost, and February came in with a feeling in the air which just carried a suggestion of spring to people who were not too busy to notice it. Mr. Blunt was hardly one of these. He had been detained in town three or four days beyond the time originally proposed, and very heavily worked from morning till night. He had scarcely seen his cousins, except late in the evenings, when he was so thoroughly wearied out, that compassion obliged them to leave him to himself ; and now, on the following morning, Joyce and he were to start by an early train for Elmwood. That day, his work was pretty well concluded ; he was able to leave home later, and to walk to Miss Fosterâ\\x80\\x99s door with Joyce on his way â\\x80\\x98You are getting thinner and thinner, upon my word!â\\x80\\x99 he said, as they parted, looking in dismay at her pale face. â\\x80\\x98 What shall we do to you at Elmwood ? Establish telegraphic com 172 munication with this house, I begin to think.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Perhaps, when I am gone, it will be better,â\\x80\\x99 said his cousin, wearily.MORE QUESTIONS THAN ONE. 333 â\\x80\\x98 I know very well that, if you were not too polite to say so, you would be wishing me at the Antipodes, for suggesting this departure.â\\x80\\x99 * Well, Clement, then we are equal,â\\x80\\x99 she said, with a touch of her old spirit ; â\\x80\\x98 for I have certainly spoilt your visit, and now, I suppose, I shall spoil my own.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Nonsense ! Come, for once I will be a prophet, and foretell that you will hear better news this morning.â\\x80\\x99 She shook her head, opened the door, and went in ; but Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s face in the passage, and her first words, almost sent her back again, with the vain hope that her cousinâ\\x80\\x99s quick steps had not carried him out of hearing. â\\x80\\x98 Dr. Blake says so ! â\\x80\\x99 Lydia said, between laughing and cry 172 ing ; â\\x80\\x98 I heard him say so to Missus with my own ears. Why, he knows me quite well, Miss ; and you â\\x80\\x99re not to go up, nor nobody, for he must be kept as quiet as can be.â\\x80\\x99 Joyce could not speak. She, who was generally never at a fault for a wordâ\\x80\\x94she, who was prompt and ready in all emergenciesâ\\x80\\x94could not so much as send a message to little Miss Foster. She felt as if a great stone were lifted off her heart. Never before had she known such a gush of joy and thankfulness as suddenly brightened her whole existence ; but it seemed for a moment to make her dizzy, and, unseen by the little maid, she put out her hand and caught the banisters. That minute was a bond between them. Lydia had always felt that Miss Clayton disapproved of Miss Fosterâ\\x80\\x99s choice of a servant, and was inclined to be pert and reckless ; but, through the long weary illness, her better qualities had been brought out. She was fond of the child, touched with her mistressâ\\x80\\x99s sorrowful patience, and she nursed him with a devoted care which no one expected from her, and which was unwearying.334 ONE YEAR. Long ago, Joyce had forgiven her; but Lydia still nourished a dislike against Miss Clayton until this morning, when the great joy of the household opened her heart, and over the little boy â\\x80\\x94given back to them at last, from the veiy gate of the graveâ\\x80\\x94 there could be no bitterness or remembrance of a fancied wrong.CHAPTER XIX.

Elsie, will you put aside the books ? â\\x80\\x99 Elsie obeyed in a pondering fashion, as if she were thinking of other things ; so that in her abstraction she carried off Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s paint-box with the German dictionary, and caused her sister to exclaim that she was just like Anne. She was, in fact, very much taken up with the idea of Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s visit. Joyce was almost the only person she knew whom she could make up her mind she thoroughly liked : she admired her energy, her capable ways, her universal power of pleasing, and she believed her to be altogether honestâ\\x80\\x94possessing, moreover, the merit of being one of themselves ; and if she did not exactly say this to herself in recapitulating J oyceâ\\x80\\x99s virtues, she certainly thought, with a sigh of relief, that she was thankful they were not pre 172 paring for a stranger. Miss Villars and Anne had gone to the station to meet their guest. Elsie, released from the school-room, went round the house with, apparently, no better motive than poking fires, and giving her cousinâ\\x80\\x99s room its last touch, in the shape of a bunch of snowdrops, which she had rescued from their forlorn con 172 templation of a backward spring in the garden ; and then, when she heard voices in the hall, was seized with a fit of shy 172 ness, and dared not go down until there was a general outcry for â\\x80\\x98 Elsie ; â\\x80\\x99 and Joyce was half-way up the stairs, scolding and kissing her in the same breath, before she knew where she was. â\\x80\\x98 Why did you not come to the station ? â\\x80\\x99BREAKING THE ICE. 337 â\\x80\\x98 I thought there were too many of us,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, still shy, and looking at her cousin with a little wonderâ\\x80\\x94Joyce seemed so womanly, and so thoroughly at her ease. 1 Oh, dear, how tall you have all grown ! â\\x80\\x99 said the latter rue 172 fully ; â\\x80\\x98 even Bella has actually the presumption to overtop me ! Where is my uncle ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 In the study,â\\x80\\x99 where an invading party found him absorbed in a comparison of two ancient authors, serenely unconscious of the hubbub of young voices in the hall. Joyceâ\\x80\\x94which is Joyce?â\\x80\\x99 he said, looking round with be 172 wilderment, as soon as he understood the state of the case. â\\x80\\x98 This one, papa,â\\x80\\x99 Elsie said, mischievously, pushing forward Anne. The temporary shyness soon wore off : there was a great deal to tell and hear on either side. London was a strange far-away world to the country girls ; and Joyce, on the other hand, had so long been absent from Elmwood, that everything needed comment. Old Cato was dead, and in his place resided a sober middle-aged Draco, who was as conservative as his mis 172 tresses, and, not understanding Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s relationship, ignored her existence, and treated her with supreme indifference, which would not relax to so much as one friendly wag. But the changes were generally those of death or old age ; Joyce could have declared that not a tree had been cut down, not a flower-bed altered, since the time when she was there before. There was the old Turkey carpetâ\\x80\\x94only a little more faded; there were the same old-fashioned papers on the walls, the same uncomfortable sofa, the same chairs standing in the same place; the piano, rather the worse for wear; the solid-looking books, on whicf fifty years, more or less, would make but little impression \\'. altogether an air of Eastern immutability rested upon the Elm- 22338 ONE YEAR. wood surroundings, which made Joyce smile, and recall Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s indignation when, one day, she discovered a new housemaid altering the position of two large china jars. * How quiet it seems here ! â\\x80\\x99 she said, when they had settled round the drawing-room fire. â\\x80\\x98 Very quiet and very dull, my dear, after London,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Yillars, a little anxiously, not sharing fully her niecesâ\\x80\\x99 confidence in the superior charms of Elmwood. â\\x80\\x98 I hardly know how you will like such a change.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I ? Oh, I canâ\\x80\\x99t tell you how much I shall like it ! My eyes had begun to believe that it was necessary for everything to have a mixture of black.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But London must be delightful ! â\\x80\\x99 put in Bella. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, of course it has its advantages,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce carelessly; â\\x80\\x98 only perhaps fresh colouring can hardly be counted among themâ\\x80\\x94especially at this time of the year. Clement says that, even where we are, we are losing our country complexions.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 By the way, where is Clement ? â\\x80\\x99 inquired Elsie. â\\x80\\x98 I wanted him not to come beyond Defforton ; but he insisted upon delivering me into safe custody, and now he has gone off for an hour to the Cottage. So, as he is there, I suppose there is no chance of my seeing Mademoiselle Lafon to-night. The sisters looked at one another in surprise. â\\x80\\x98To-night ! â\\x80\\x99 repeated Anne. â\\x80\\x98 No, I suppose not. You could not have asked her to come away. But I dare say she will be here early to-morrow. Of course, you see a great deal of her ? â\\x80\\x99 I am afraid that as Joyce had been travelling all day with Clement, the question was a little malicious. â\\x80\\x98Yes, of courseâ\\x80\\x94in and out,â\\x80\\x99 said Bella, boldly. â\\x80\\x98You know, the weather has been so bad lately.â\\x80\\x99BREAKING THE ICE. 339 â\\x80\\x98 It is not the weather ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Elsie, looking indignantly at her sister ] â\\x80\\x98 and we hardly see her at all. She is so different from everybody.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What a relief! â\\x80\\x99 remarked Joyce. Elsie looked at her with amazement. â\\x80\\x98 Why, what do you mean ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, donâ\\x80\\x99t you get tired of people just for the reason that they are all so much alike ? But do you mean that you canâ\\x80\\x99t persuade her to come here ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t think we have tried very much,â\\x80\\x99 acknowledged Anne. â\\x80\\x98 Donâ\\x80\\x99t you see, Joyce, she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t suit us.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I wonder whether I shall suit her,â\\x80\\x99 Joyce said in a dreamy way, which made them all laugh. â\\x80\\x98 I dare say she will think me very stupid.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You, Joyce ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But I should like her to put up with me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Joyce, she is French,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, in despair. â\\x80\\x98Yes ; it is a comfort to think oneâ\\x80\\x99s accent can be rubbed up a little.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She talks about being penetrated with gratitude,â\\x80\\x99 interposed Rose, mimicking Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s voice. â\\x80\\x98 That is very kind of her, because such a scrap as you canâ\\x80\\x99t do much to make her obliged to you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t do anything,â\\x80\\x99 said Rose, straightforwardly. â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what you mean.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, then it was the others, of course, that she meant. I beg your pardon, Rose.â\\x80\\x99 There was a dead silence. Joyce looked placidly into the fire, and the sisters uncomfortably at her. At last Anne began again, in an apologetic voice, â\\x80\\x98You see, Joyce, unless people are likely to take to one34Â° ONE YEAR. another in the end, it is so very hard to go through all the beginning part of it. I meanâ\\x80\\x94-I mean it is all up hill at first, and it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem worth while ; and Elsie and I do very well together â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said her cousin, still gazing meditatively into the fire, â\\x80\\x98it is very pleasant for you to be independent of other likings ; and I was thinking who Mademoiselle Lafon has ? Who is her friend ? â\\x80\\x99 Another silence. â\\x80\\x98Poor child!â\\x80\\x99 said kind-hearted Miss Villars, â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t really think she has anybody.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 There was Mrs. Chambers,â\\x80\\x99 faltered Anne. â\\x80\\x98 Mrs. Chambers ! Is she Mademoiselle Lafonâ\\x80\\x99s principal friend ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, indeed,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Villars, shaking her head. â\\x80\\x98 She was very much taken with her at first, and promised all sorts of things ; but she seems to have forgotten all about them. And poor old Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny is quite miserable about it : she even wanted me to ask Mrs. Chambers the reason. I am sure I donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x94I hardly like doing such a thing.â\\x80\\x99 Even by the fire-light, Joyce, who was thinking how prettily it danced upon Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s fair hair, wondered what brought the colour suddenly into her face. â\\x80\\x98 Then she does not seem to get very satisfactory companion 172 ship in that quarter ? â\\x80\\x99 she Â¿aid, when Miss Villars paused. â\\x80\\x98 To be sureâ\\x80\\x94I cannot understand it ! Mrs. Chambers is not unkind, but thoughtless, certainly : it can be nothing else.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Papa always says it is nothing short of cruelty to raise a girlâ\\x80\\x99s expectations and hopes, and then dash them down, as people sometimes do.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Joyce,â\\x80\\x99 said Anne, seriously, â\\x80\\x98do you really mean to say thatBREAKING THE ICE. 341 you think we have \"been unkind to Mademoiselle Lafon ? I wish you would tell us, and say what we ought to do ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I ? Oh, no, no ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Joyce, shrinking at the remem 172 brance of the result of trying to force her own will upon other people. â\\x80\\x98 I beg your pardon, Anne. I did not mean to find fault ; I did not, indeed ! Of course, not living here, I can be no judge ; only, from being only one, perhaps I can understand better what it must be to go to a place and feel quite solitary and friendless.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I did not think about its being any pleasure to her,â\\x80\\x99 said Anne, humbly ; while Bella added, in a self-complacent voice, â\\x80\\x98 I am sure I have done what I could. Of course, she is not quite up to the mark ; but, being French, perhaps that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter so muchâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94a speech which made Joyce go off into a fit of laughter, and beg that she might be furnished with Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s standard, that she might do her utmost not to fall short of it. Miss Yillars smiled lovingly at the young faces gathered about her. They were a continual care and responsibilityâ\\x80\\x94more so to her than would have been the case with a person of less anxious temperamentâ\\x80\\x94but she loved them none the less dearly. She thought what a pretty contrast was made by Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s bright, keenly intelligent face and Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s perfectly formed features and more dreamy expression ; she listened w r ith delight to their merry laughter, and the reminiscences of Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s last visit, upon which the conversation had turned. â\\x80\\x98 I hope old Jane Back has got over her persuasion that I am just the very moral of that dreadful red-haired grandson who was imprisoned for poaching.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You should have heard old Thomasâ\\x80\\x99s indignation ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Poor old Thomas ! How is he ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t work here now. The garden was too much for342 ONE YEAR. him, so he just goes out now and then. He keeps the Cottage garden in order.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Do you remember, Elsie, when he was clipping the edges of that half-moon shaped bed, his standing over it in a medi 172 tative attitude, and at last coming out with, â\\x80\\x9c I simâ\\x80\\x99t is by the pattern of moonshine â\\x80\\x9d ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I never look at the bed without thinking of it.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Follaton wandered in, and the conversation became general, as he seemed ready to bear a part in it, and to look at Joyce with a wondering, half-awakened consciousness that his little niece was no longer a child. He dearly loved argument ; and although no match for him, Joyce was not so easily de 172 molished as to be contemptible. She lived sufficiently in the world to be conversant with leading topics, and to know what clever men said about them ; moreover, he discovered that, on the occasion of a famous debate to which he alluded, she had â\\x96\\xa0been in the House and heard a certain speech which had stirred menâ\\x80\\x99s minds even when it was but laid before them in print, and of which she was delighted to describe the thrilling impres 172 sion when heard and enforced with all the added charm of a magnificent delivery. Anne and Elsie listened and admired : Bella admired also, and took mental notes of points which it might be useful to repeat in conversation. Poor little Rose tried to enjoy the dignity of sitting up, in spite of sleepy yawns which would not be sur 172 passed, until she fell fast asleep, and tumbled off her chair ; and, for Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s sake, the evening was made to end at an early hour. Elsie stood by the fire in her cousinâ\\x80\\x99s room while the latter unpacked. â\\x80\\x98 Anne is very uncomfortable about what you said of Made 172 moiselle Lafon,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98 If you are right, we must have been allBREAKING THE ICE. 343 wrong. But I donâ\\x80\\x99t see it, Joyce ; I donâ\\x80\\x99t see why we should have jumped into her arms, or that one is bound to like everybody.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Donâ\\x80\\x99t expect me to settle it. She has been here long enough for you to have found out what there is in her, and whether you have no points of agreement â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am afraid,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie ruefully, â\\x80\\x98 that no one has tried to find out anything.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I suppose you have her occasionally to spend the evening ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Only once, when Clement was at the Cottage.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Nor to walk with you ? â\\x80\\x99 Elsie made a face. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, well, we can have some grand walks together, and we will set to work to make her like us all.â\\x80\\x99 Joyce was very happy; it seemed to her as if never in her life had she been so happy. The relief after the long strain, the weight lifted off her heart, was greater than she had ever believed possible. But, like a soldier who has once been sur 172 prised by a hidden foe, she felt as if no watchfulness could be too vigilant, as if every word and thought must be examined ; and now, after Elsie had left her that night, she thought over what she had said, and the motives for it all. She had learned better to know her heart. There was the wish to show kindness to Ursule; with it lay the hope that Ursule would appreciate the contrast of her larger-hearted, more genial nature. There was the desire to do what would please Clement, shadowed by the belief that he would acknowledge the advantage of her influ 172 ence. There was the pleasure of seeing her cousins do them 172 selves justice, and the pleasure of having been the means of awakening them to a sense of what they should do. Ah, yes, every light had its shadow ! She had not conquered herselfâ\\x80\\x94 that work was one which would fill a lifetime, would cost her344 ONE YEAR. many a fierce straggle yet ; but she was finding out what she had to conquer, and there, by Godâ\\x80\\x99s help, lay her good hope. Meanwhile, a difficulty met her at every turnâ\\x80\\x94the inclination to give up something that she knew to be right, because it was surrounded with the snare to be pleased with her own share in it. For instance, Clement had confided to her the relative position of Ursule and her cousins, and asked her to use her influence with the latter to set things on a pleasanter footing. Joyce knew that she could do so, and all that had passed in conversation during the evening but assured her of it more entirely. When, however, she examined into hÃ«r own motives, the discovery of what they were like disgusted her to such a degree, that she was inclined to punish herself by withdrawing altogether from the attempt. Yet that could not be right? She thought over it on her knees, and, with a sigh, she resolved that it must be wrong to let others suffer through her weakness ; that she would do what she could, would keep herself as much as possible out of sight, would watch, and pray, and battle against the love of government, the desire to be foremost, the wish to take the duties of others out of their hands, and, for the rest, would go steadily onwards, believing that He, who had shown her something of the secret springs of her own heart, would also guide her in her endeavours to bend them according to His will. The next day was warm, soft, and damp ; the sea looked grey and hazy ; in the garden, rows of white crocuses bordered the beds with exquisitely curved, half-opened blossoms, and the little winter aconite peeped up in the shrubbery. Nothing would please Joyce but to read in the school-room until twelve, then to carry off Anne and Elsie to make the round of the garden, kitchen-garden and all ; and when she had satisfiedBREAKING THE ICE. 345 herself with a sight of all her old friends, she proposed going through the churchyard to the Cottage. â\\x80\\x98 It is so early ! â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, with a groan ; â\\x80\\x98 besides which, you are the person to be called upon : you need not really go, Joyce.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But I want to go ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Only because you think you must. Look hereâ\\x80\\x94we ought to invite her to tea, I know. Aunt Clare shall write a little note, and ask her to come to-morrow evening. That will be doing the civil, and you need not trouble yourself about her to-day.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Elsie, am I to suppose that I am afflicted with a cousin who does not really know the torments of feminine curiosity ! I tell you that I want to see her, that I am longing to write a full description of her to my mother, and that only my polite 172 ness to you and Miss Smith has kept me from going an hour ago !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, it is true. Besides which,â\\x80\\x99 continued Joyce, changing her tone, â\\x80\\x98 it is rather a formidable thing for her to come into the midst of such a large party, with a strange cousin added to it, poor thing ! Come along, Elsie.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, dear ; and she will say all sorts of absurd literal trans 172 lations, which always make me feel inclined to laugh.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Penetrated with gratitude,â\\x80\\x9d and all that sort of thing, I suppose,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, a little contemptuously. â\\x80\\x98 Really, Elsie, I should leave those wonders to Rose ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, good-humouredly, â\\x80\\x98I see Anne screwing herself up to the effort, so there is no use in my fighting any longer. And there is always the hope that she may not be at home.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny will be rather terrific without her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny ! â\\x80\\x99 cried Anne, stopping.346 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Yesâ\\x80\\x94is she not ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, Joyce, we never see her ! Aunt Clare goes; but we never think of such a thing.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98How strange! You mean that she wonâ\\x80\\x99t see visitors? I fancied Clement described her as sociably inclined. At all events, I must ask whether she will admit me or not : papa would be vexed, unless I did so.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And do you actually not mind it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Why, Anne, I shall begin to believe I am going into a nest of ogresses ! Why should one mind ? â\\x80\\x99 But Joyce received no answer. Elsie was half amused, half provoked ; while Anne was awakening to a perception that her cousin took certain things into the range of duties which she had been accustomed to consider simply matters of choice, and her reflections lasted to the door of the Cottage. Ursule, meanwhile, had been thinking not a little of her pos 172 sible visitor. Clement had been there the evening before, and talked of her more than was judicious, and, it must be confessed, with the effect only of causing Ursule a slight heart-sinking, instead of exciting the pleasant anxiety for her acquaintance which he desired to arouse. She listened and smiledâ\\x80\\x94she liked to listen to Mr. Bluntâ\\x80\\x94as he descanted upon all Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s merits, her usefulness, her cheerfulness, her talents, her readiness ; but ; in her heart, she felt a certainty that this was but another of those English demoiselles whom she began to dread to encounter, and, with a little sigh, she thought also that Mr. Blunt praised her very warmlyâ\\x80\\x94as if he liked her very much. â\\x80\\x98 Shall I see her, I wonder ? â\\x80\\x99 she said to herself. â\\x80\\x98 Mr. Blunt thought his cousins would bring her here. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think they willâ\\x80\\x94not for many days, at all events, and then perhaps Bella will walk down with her.â\\x80\\x99BREAKING THE ICE. 347 Then she found, to her astonishment, that Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny quite expected to see Joyce at once. â\\x80\\x98 But certainly,â\\x80\\x99 she explained, â\\x80\\x98 when I am almost an aunt ; â\\x80\\x99 and, while she spoke, a ring sounded at the front door, and she became radiant over the fulfilment of her prognostications, desiring that the ladies, whoever they were, might be brought up at once. Poor Anne ! By right of her position, she led the van ; and the old French lady could hardly resist a contemptuous shrug at all the sins against taste which made themselves manifest in her very entry into the room. She was so shy and frightened as to be almost speechless ; and her hat had an irresistible pro 172 pensity to tilt slightly on one side, giving her a helpless expres 172 sion which was comic in the extreme. Madame was pitiless. She considered both herself and Ursule to have been neglected by the Miss Follatons, and she looked up and down Anne with a little wondering air which was far from reassuring. But Joyce came briskly to the rescue. In her bright manner, which, if it was a little over-decided, was so genial that it always charmed, she made herself known to Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny and Ursule, talked of her father and mother, and talked moreover as if they belonged to one another, instead of keeping them outside the limits of the circle which Ursule had begun to think was guarded by a very phalanx of thorns. She contrived, by an inge 172 nious exercise of tact, to make her cousins take their share in the conversation, and actually to warm them into something like cordiality. She asked Anne for a receipt which would infallibly do good to a pain in the arm, of which Madame complained ; and led Elsie, before she knew what she was about, to offer Ursule some flower-seeds. Madame was delighted. Ursule looked wistfully at her, wondering whether this acquaintance34Â» ONE YEAR. was to end like Mrs. Chambersâ\\x80\\x99s, or whether she could trust again ; then she heard Clementâ\\x80\\x99s name mentioned, and listened eagerly to hear what Joyce said of him. Joyce, on her part, felt the same curiosity; and, after all, it was Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny who said the most, and poured out voluble eulogiums upon him, interspersed with allusions to his conduct on the day of the storm, of which his cousin knew but little. When at length they rose to go, something like a friendly footing seemed to be established between them. â\\x80\\x98You will come often, will \"ou not?â\\x80\\x99 Madame said, in her most gracious tone. â\\x80\\x98Yes, indeed; we are near neighbours enough forme to come very often, I hope. I will bring you my motherâ\\x80\\x99s photograph â\\x80\\x94let me seeâ\\x80\\x94to-morrowâ\\x80\\x94Elsie, isnâ\\x80\\x99t there something to be done to-morrow?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 We are to go to Defforton.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, yes, of course ! Mademoiselle Lafon, how do you like Defforton ? â\\x80\\x99 Ursule shook her head in answer to the question. â\\x80\\x98I? I have never been there.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Then you shall go,â\\x80\\x99 thought Joyce, â\\x80\\x98if I have to ask you myself point blank. But, oh, dear me ! here I am again arran 172 ging everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s business ! Never mind ; I will work round Anne, and keep in the back-ground myself.â\\x80\\x99 And she managed so judiciously, that Anne found herself almost unconsciously inviting Ursule to join their party on the following day. She hesitated, and would have refused, but that Madame interposed. â\\x80\\x98 Without doubt, you will go. It will be a refreshment to me to hear of something different from the hedges and ditchesBREAKING THE ICE. 349 which form your chief material for conversation. There are things, too, that I require ; yesâ\\x80\\x94certainly, you will go.â\\x80\\x99 And, although the words were not kind, there was in her heart a certain satisfaction that Ursule should have pleasure. Ursule could scarcely believe her senses when the visitors were gone, and she remembered all that had passed, and her own engagement for the next day. From resenting the sistersâ\\x80\\x99 coldness, she had grown to treat it as a matter of course, so that any attempt at cordiality came like a surprise. She laid it at Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s door, and she thought of Joyce with half-sad admira 172 tion. She was all that Mr. Blunt had describedâ\\x80\\x94a person to whom, throughout life, instinct would lead those who needed help to turn, and be sure that she would give it to the limit of her power. She was his favourite cousinâ\\x80\\x94very fond of him, no doubt, very clever, highly educated. Ursule wondered if she could ever be like her ; then blamed herself for her own pre 172 sumption. What was she but a poor ignorant girl, whom people in his country despised ? What was she ? and how could she have expected different treatment ? â\\x80\\x98 Oh, if I was back again with you, dear old friends ! â\\x80\\x99 said poor Ursule, stretching out her hands towards the sea. It was strange enough that her heart should have cried out in this manner just when she had received a little touch of kindness, especially as but the day before she had fancied that she was quite content to stay. It was one of those perverse crooks which sometimes take hold of people, and she felt quite ashamed of herself afterwards. Bella chose to be one of the party in the Defforton expedi 172 tion ; and Anne, always ready to give way, remained at home, as Miss Villars, Joyce, Elsie, Bella, and Ursule made a suffi 172 ciently large number without additions. They were to go by an early train, shop, take luncheon at Mr. Bluntâ\\x80\\x99s, and afterwards35Â° ONE YEAR. attend the service at the old Abbey Church. Mr. Clayton wrote good reports of little Harry, and Joyce was in high spirits â\\x80\\x94bent especially upon Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s enjoyment, and upon baffling Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s attempt to tyrannize over her aunt. Ursule had lost a great deal of her old daring light-heartedness, but every now and then it flashed out in genuine pleasure, and, with Miss Villarsâ\\x80\\x99s kindly manner and Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s friendliness, the feeling of strangeness which generally seized upon her in the society of either Anne or Elsie was kept at bay. She liked the old town, with its quaint gabled houses, reminding her of Normandy; she was amused at the shops, and very glad of the opportunity of buying a few things to replenish her scanty wardrobe ; and, perhaps, she was more pleased by seeing her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s sea-picture hanging in Clementâ\\x80\\x99s room than by anything else during the day. Mr. Blunt was not there when they arrived, and the cousins turned over his books and pictures without compunction. Bella was taken up with the photograph-book, when, glancing up, she saw Joyce standing in rapt admiration before this picture. â\\x80\\x98 Mind you donâ\\x80\\x99t say anything about that,â\\x80\\x99 she whispered, going up to her, and pretending to be still taken up with her book. â\\x80\\x98 Why not? â\\x80\\x99 asked Joyce, with an instinctive dislike to Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s mysteries. â\\x80\\x98 It would be very disagreeable for Ursule.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Disagreeable to Ursule ? What do you mean ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Hush ! she is looking at us now.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, why should she mind my admiring this picture?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Joyce, canâ\\x80\\x99t you guess? It was actually painted by her father.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Was it really ? Then I am sure I shall go and tell her how beautiful it seems to me.â\\x80\\x99BREAKING THE ICE. 351 â\\x80\\x98 Pray, donâ\\x80\\x99t. I am certain she would be horrified.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, Bella!â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, impatiently, â\\x80\\x98canâ\\x80\\x99t you tell me straight out what you mean ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Why, I mean that it would not be very pleasant for her that every one should know her father was a poor artist, when she has got into a different position here.â\\x80\\x99 This time Joyce stared in unfeigned amazement. â\\x80\\x98What are you talking about ? Do you actually suppose that she would not be proud of it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Mrs. Chambers was shocked to hear it,â\\x80\\x99 said Bella, doggedly. â\\x80\\x98 Was she ? â\\x80\\x99 Bella felt Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s keen eye full on her, and wished she had left matters alone. She nervously clasped and unclasped the book. â\\x80\\x98 That sort of artist, you know. Of course, it is different in some cases.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Thank you for the explanation. And you do not think Mademoiselle Lafon would like to be reminded of her family ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No ; I should think notâ\\x80\\x94certainly not.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Mademoiselle Lafon!â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce aloud, in her clear dis 172 tinct voice, â\\x80\\x98 Bella tells me that you have something to do with this picture.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah, yes ! â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, smiling, although tears rose in her eyes ; â\\x80\\x98it is my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s painting. It is good of Mr. Blunt to have it here : you do not know how the sight of it brings home before me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How beautiful it is ! â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, touched, and looking kindly at Ursule. â\\x80\\x98 I do not know whether it is his best,â\\x80\\x99 Ursule said, timidly; â\\x80\\x98 but we always liked it the best. It seems as if it taught you the very secrets of the sea, and the hidden forces it contains. Every wave has its purpose.â\\x80\\x99352 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Here is Clement,â\\x80\\x99 announced Miss Villars, who had been sitting at the window looking out upon the old Abbey Church, black with age ; and the fine elms round it, swelling with symptoms of spring, and just showing their red buds. He came in hurriedly, apologizing for the delay, and not at first seeing his unexpected visitor. When he did catch sight of her, his first impulse was to give Joyce a grateful look. By-and- bye, when the greetings were over, he came up to her, and said in a whisper, â\\x80\\x98 Thank you neartily. I was sure you would do what you could.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, the girls would be kind if they only knew how,â\\x80\\x99 she said, as a sudden, disagreeable idea flashed through her mind. Could it be possible that he liked Ursule? Joyce felt a strange chok 172 ing sensation in her throat : it seemed to her as if he was their own propertyâ\\x80\\x94always belonging to themâ\\x80\\x94and as if this fancy was unendurable. Certainly, she had promised to be kind to Ursule; but such a possibility had then never crossed her mind : now it flashed upon her as the explanation of many things he had said, perhaps unconscious of the workings of his own heart. To Joyce, the brightness seemed to be taken out of the day. She smiled and chatted more vigorously than ever; but her thoughts kept reverting to what she believed was coming to pass, until she despised herself for her own weakness. Clement â\\x80\\x94 Clement who had lived with them as one of themselvesâ\\x80\\x94 Clement who, throughout her last trouble, had been so kind and sympathisingâ\\x80\\x94was it possible that her surmise was true ? and if it was true, how could she bear the thought of it ? She could not look at Ursule, she kept apart, and walked with Miss Villars to the afternoon service, hearing her soft voice purringBREAKING THE ICE. 353 in her ear, and only every now and then obliged to answer in a monosyllable. Once in the church, the quiet soothed her. She was able to think more connectedly and justly. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s life stood before herâ\\x80\\x94the loneliness and want of interest which she had professed to pity ; and she felt as if all that she had permitted herself to admit about her rose up in judgment against her selfishness. Perhaps, after all, it was but a girlâ\\x80\\x99s romance; yet there was something heroic in her earnest reso 172 lutionâ\\x80\\x94tearful, and made on her kneesâ\\x80\\x94to put herself on one side, and to think only of the happiness of others. Through the old painted windows streamed the western sun ; up to the vaulted roof rose the sweet clear voices of the choristers ; the massive pillars, the noble arches, with their grave depths of shade, stood as they had stood for long centuries ; and, like all great things, whether of nature or art, which seem to us un 172 changeableâ\\x80\\x94like the sea, fixed by an eternal decreeâ\\x80\\x94like the everlasting hills themselves, their influence calmed unquiet thoughts, put aside the little jars and frets of daily life, and lifted the soul into the region of immortality which God has given it for its own. Clementâ\\x80\\x99s love would have made the world very sweet to Joyce. She had never let herself acknowledge it before ; but her thoughts had been unconsciously coloured by his influence, and she had grown to think of him as part of her 172 self. There was a bitterness in the perception of thisâ\\x80\\x94a shame added to sorrow, which in another place might have made itself sting more sharply. The old church soothed her ; ages spoke to her through the worn grey stones ; earth seemed but a short journey-â\\x80\\x94heaven near. What was her little trial to compare with those through which others had passed ?â\\x80\\x94those which she had sometimes thought she was ready to encounter? Poor Joyce ! There was a sharp struggle before her yet ; but it was354 ONE YEAR. well for her that it began with prayer, and met her where high thoughts came down to brace ; well for her that her winterâ\\x80\\x99s lesson had taught her not to shut her eyes, but to keep guard over an eager will, and try with an honest endeavour to bend it to the Divine teaching. On their way to the station, Clement got hold of Joyce. * How do you like her ? â\\x80\\x99 he said, eagerly. He cared enough for Joyce to have great confidence in her judgment. She knew how sometimes a word of hers had raised or cast down something of which he was doubtful, and for an instant she paused. Very little had she seen of Ursule ; and it would have been enough to say so. Surely she was not called upon to assist actively in the erection of this fairy castle, of which she fancied she saw the foundations. The thought flashed across her, and then every generous impulse rose up and thrust it out. â\\x80\\x98 All that I have seen I like heartily, Clement,â\\x80\\x99 she said, look 172 ing bravely into his face. â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you half know what a lonely life she must have had to lead this winter, or how well she bears it. I am sure I shall like herâ\\x80\\x94sure ! â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER XX. THE DINNER-PARTY. Beat. Against my will, Ã\\x8d am sent to bid you come in to dinner. Much Ado about Nothing. the little kitchen at the Cottage, as clean as two iair of hands could make it, Sarah and Bessie were olding counsel together, which, by their looks, was upon some weighty matter. â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99d better speak yourself,â\\x80\\x99 said the former, decidedlyâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 thereâ\\x80\\x99s no cause why you shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t ; and you can say Iâ\\x80\\x99m willing to do the work while you â\\x80\\x99re spared to help your mother. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s a note come from the Rectory : you can take it up at the same time.â\\x80\\x99 But Bessie hung back. * I donâ\\x80\\x99t like to,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98 Bless the girl, and why not ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I should be thinking of the time when I said Iâ\\x80\\x99d go. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think sheâ\\x80\\x99d give me leave.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, now, Bessie,â\\x80\\x99 said her aunt, â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind saying it was me that was wrong there. It did put me about to see Mr. Clement turned out, and strangers coming in ; and I was so hurt, I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t help saying what I didnâ\\x80\\x99t ought. But, stranger or not, I will say that all this winter no one can have behaved better 23â\\x80\\x94235 6 ONE YEAR. than Miss Lafon ; and though I donâ\\x80\\x99t consider it would be be 172 coming in me, being one of the old family, to take up violent with her, I should always speak well of herâ\\x80\\x94that I say. I pity her too, poor young thing, here by herself; and so lonely as she has been all this winter, and that old Madame with her ways and her whims at her continual. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t say as she isnâ\\x80\\x99t fond of her all the time, and I know she complains of her not having no one to be about with. Oh, I can understand that much ! I know how pleased she was when Mrs. Chambers came here. But, Bessie, my dear, as you get older and wiser you â\\x80\\x9911 learn that everybody can see the faults of othersâ\\x80\\x94the sweep never thinks his own soot can blacken; and there Madame goes, crying out at other people, and all the while worriting worse herself.â\\x80\\x99 Having delivered herself of which moral reflection, Sarah took the note, and went up-stairs to ask leave for Bessie to go home and nurse a sick brother. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s decided conduct had gained her the old servantâ\\x80\\x99s respect, and, by little and little, her love. She had numberless prejudices to overcome ; but she rather pleased herself in the task of conquering them, and they were gradually melting away before the sunny smile which was Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s most irresistible auxiliary. She gave Bessie leave of absence, without any demur, and asked a great many questions about the boy who was ill ; and, not knowing whether she was doing right or wrong, or acting contrary to custom, inquired whether she might go and see him herself, to which Sarah graciously consented. â\\x80\\x98 What have you there, petite 1 â\\x80\\x99 asked Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny. â\\x80\\x98 Only a little letter from the Rectoryâ\\x80\\x94a little letter in Miss Villarsâ\\x80\\x99s writing. Oh, Madame, it is an invitation ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 For what ? â\\x80\\x99THE DINNER-PARTY. 357 â\\x80\\x98 It is to be on Tuesday. They have friends to take dinner with them, and ask me to come in the evening.â\\x80\\x99 Madame sighed. â\\x80\\x98 It will be delightful ! â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, radiant with satisfaction. She had never been to a party, and longed to see what it was like. Madame sighed again more deeply. â\\x80\\x98 That is the way,â\\x80\\x99 she said: â\\x80\\x98for you young people, nothing but gaieties and enjoy 172 ment ; for us, pain, and loneliness, and all that there is of sad.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Do not say so, dear Madame,â\\x80\\x99 said poor Ursule, smitten with compunction. â\\x80\\x98 I had not time to think : I will not go. I did not remember that you would have no one to play bÃ¨zique with you, or to read the newspaper. It is very good of Miss Yillars ; but I will not go.â\\x80\\x99 But Madame was satisfied when she made her self-sacrifice apparent. â\\x80\\x98 It is impossible for you to refuse such an invitation ; it would not be comme il faut. I am accustomed to be set on one side.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule shook her head. â\\x80\\x98 I was foolish to dream of it ; I have no dress,â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah, bah ! As if there were not oneâ\\x80\\x94twoâ\\x80\\x94three days before Tuesday! You are in mourning, requiring nothing more than a simple toilette : the materials may be procured by the carrier, and you will need little to outshine those gauches girls. Ciel! it is a malady so much as to look at that Miss Anne !â\\x80\\x94her hat here, her hair there. Such elbows ! such a stoop ! such a walk ! Is she imbÃ©cille? Has she one idea?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Do you really think it is possible for me to go ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Ursule, eagerly, brightening again at the idea, and full of excite 172 ment. * But you say yourself that you will be lonely ? â\\x80\\x99 * I am always lonely,â\\x80\\x99 replied Madame with dignity.358 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98And I make no difference?â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, kneeling by her side, with a smile. â\\x80\\x98 I do not say that. You are a good child ; you do your best,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, after a little struggle with herself; and Ursule clapped her hands merrily at the concession. But she drew back when Madame passed her hand over her hair : the action always brought a remembrance and a pang ; for it was Louisâ\\x80\\x99 favourite caress, and she could not bear it from other hands. â\\x80\\x98You are a good child,â\\x80\\x99 continued Madame, graciously, â\\x80\\x98and I am grateful you are not Miss Anne.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But she is very good,â\\x80\\x99 pleaded Ursule. â\\x80\\x98 Whatever duties may be performed, there is one which no one has a right to neglectâ\\x80\\x94the duty of pleasing others. Now, can it please me to have a hand thrust at me as if to knock me down? Can there be a pleasure in regarding a costume in 172 congruous, inharmonious, offensive?â\\x80\\x94in conversing with a young lady who can neither convey an idea, nor answer beyond â\\x80\\x9c Yes â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9c No â\\x80\\x9d to those with which I may present her ? Cer 172 tainly not,â\\x80\\x99 concluded Madame ; â\\x80\\x98 and therefore I maintain that Miss Anne is culpable in the non-performance of her duties.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule could not help smiling. The description was exact. She knew too few of Anneâ\\x80\\x99s sterling qualities to be ready to defend her ; and she was thinking anxiously of the dress which the carrier was to buy, and her own fingers manufacture. Ma 172 dame was delighted at the new interest. She consideredâ\\x80\\x94in some respects truly-â\\x80\\x94herself to have been the maker of Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s fortunes. She was fond of contrasting her position in former days with that which she now enjoyed; and she was presently absorbed in a discussion upon delicious shades and ravishing trimmings, among which it appeared as if instinct, not expe 172 rience, taught her which the present mode preferred.THE DINNER-PARTY. 359 Joyce thought of everything. She was at the Cottage before the day was out, ostensibly with a newspaper for Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Au- rigny, in reality to see whether Ursule wanted anything which she could help her to supply. She found her in a state of so much enjoyment at the prospect before her, that she could not but think sadly how little she must have tasted during the long months spent at Elmwood. The very idea of novelty of any sort possessed as great a charm for the French girl as it made the misery of Anne and Elsie. She chatted away gaily of what she expected to see, and of the store of amusement she would be able to extract for Madame on her return. Joyce, who would have had little sympathy for such excitement in another girl, was very kind to her, and was able to reassure her as to the propriety of the dress she designed wearing on the occasion ; for Ursule had not full confidence in Madameâ\\x80\\x99s discretion, and needed a little experience to assist her innate good taste. â\\x80\\x98 How good you are to me, Mademoiselle,â\\x80\\x99 she said grate 172 fully. â\\x80\\x98 Ursule, I shall be very angry if you call me Mademoiselle any longer.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule smiled and blushed. â\\x80\\x98 You have troubled yourself so much about me ! Everything seems brighter since you came to Elmwood.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My cousins are a little stiff and difficult to understand at first. They are the best girls in the world, if you only knew them.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If ! â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, with a shrug. â\\x80\\x98You will do so in time. That coldness is nothing but manner.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 So Mrs. Chambers said. But she was worse,â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, sighing. â\\x80\\x98 She promised me things which she never did. Some-36o ONE YEAR. times, do you know, I wonder whether you will turn away suddenly, like Mrs. Chambers.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I hope not ! â\\x80\\x99 Joyce said, hastily. â\\x80\\x98 She made the place quite different to me ; it was very plea 172 sant, and poor Madame liked it too. We were to have done I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how many delightful things ; and then all at onceâ\\x80\\x94 it stopped ! She should not have begun if she was not going on ; because,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, colouring, â\\x80\\x98I fancied that she liked me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But did she say nothing ? Did you never hear an explana 172 tion ? â\\x80\\x99 * No, no; not a word. Madame said that English ladies would not speak to me when they knew that in France I was not as I am here. Do you think it is so? I would have told Mrs. Chambers the next time she came, but she never came again.â\\x80\\x99 1 That horrid little Bella had something to do with it, I am certain,â\\x80\\x99 thought Joyce. Aloud, she said cheerfully, â\\x80\\x98 Never mind; things are sure to come right in the end. You have nothing to be ashamed of, Ursule.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am not ashamed : it is not that ! Ah, if you only knew how much more dear the old life was than this ! Tenez, Made 172 moiselle, there was the house to begin with ; there was not a corner in it I did not love. You went into it, and thought you were going into just such another house as you would find in the streetâ\\x80\\x94we were in a street, you know ; and instead of that, there was a staircase, oldâ\\x80\\x94as old as if it had come out of the ark, and beautifully carved, with great broad steps, up which you ran, and overhead there was the blue sky and my dear pigeons. And in the little glass room at the foot of it there was good old Madame popping out her head to know what one was doing, and Monsieurâ\\x80\\x94oh, so fat, and so content !â\\x80\\x94I have seen no one look as he did since we came to this England.â\\x80\\x99THE DINNER-PARTY. 361 She paused, and a little smile flickered over her face at the remembrance. â\\x80\\x98Those were old friends, and we are new,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, gently. â\\x80\\x98 They were all old friends,â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, with a sigh. â\\x80\\x98 Wher 172 ever one went, it was, â\\x80\\x9c How goes it, Ursule ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Bon jour, petite!\" The very sun and the birds used to sing to me as they do not now. Do not think me ungrateful, Mademoiselle, because I feel a little like an exile. I have never said so to others : I have only told you that you might understand I could not be ashamed of my old life. Besidesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 She stopped, and Joyce asked, â\\x80\\x98Besides what?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If I were ashamed of that, I should be ashamed of Louis,â\\x80\\x99 she said, in a low suppressed voice. â\\x80\\x98Your brother? Oh, no ! â\\x80\\x99 warmly exclaimed Joyce. Ursule looked quickly up, with a proud smile. â\\x80\\x98 My Louis, no ! I can never tell you what he wasâ\\x80\\x94how good, how pa 172 tient, how holy ! It seems to me as if God had sent him to show me what a beautiful life is like. And oh, Mademoiselle, if you knew what a blank there is without him ! We were always one; we shared all our thoughts. Never, never, was there the least little tiny bit of quarrel between us ; and you may think by that what he must have been, when I tried him so oftenâ\\x80\\x94I was so impatient and wilful. Now, when I do not feel kind to poor Madame, when I forget how she suffers, and want my own way, I think of Louis, and often it stops me from being cross : I am not so bad as I might be, that is. And, do you know, still, when anything happens, I think, what will Louis say ? and then it all comes over me, and I feel, oh, so lonely ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, I can understand,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, with tears in her eyes. â\\x80\\x98 I can understand, you poor child ! â\\x80\\x99 she thought ; â\\x80\\x98 and God362 ONE YEAR. forbid that I, who have so many to care for me, should grudge you anything which He may have provided to make you happy again ! â\\x80\\x99 Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s heart opened to the sympathy she saw in the good, frank face before her. â\\x80\\x98 He was so clever,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98 I should like to show you what I have not shown to any one hereâ\\x80\\x94the little pictures he drew. May I get them ? â\\x80\\x99 She ran out, and returned with them in her hands. â\\x80\\x98 He pleased himself with the fancy this was like me,â\\x80\\x99 she said, ten 172 derly, showing Joyce the graceful group of herself with the pigeons. â\\x80\\x98 It was done for a surprise. Ah, how well I remem 172 ber that day, when I told him of the June fÃªtes that were coming, and he took this from under the pillow to show me that he could work, like the rest of the world ! We were to do wonderful things, he and I, when he got strong, and made us richâ\\x80\\x94to go out together into the beautiful country, and see the peasants dance, and look in at the gates of old chateaux, and lie on the long grass under acacia-trees, and hear the birds singing in the sky. But they were all my dreams, not his : I know that now, when I look back ; and you see, Mademoiselle how they have ended.â\\x80\\x99 Tears stood in her eyes, and Joyce took her hand and kissed her. * Better things come to us than we dream,â\\x80\\x99 was all she could say. â\\x80\\x98Better things have come to him,â\\x80\\x99 Ursule said. â\\x80\\x98I have learnt not to wish him back again, and to be glad when I re 172 member that he is spared what might have been hard for him to bear. And I see his face before me very often.â\\x80\\x99 Clement has told us how beautiful it was,â\\x80\\x99 answered Joyce, softly.THE DINNER-PARTY. 363 â\\x80\\x98 Ah ! Mr. Blunt was very good to him. He liked Louis, though he did not like me. He sat with him when I was awayâ\\x80\\x94 the only time we ever separated, and it was so near the end ! â\\x80\\x99 Joyce smiled a little. â\\x80\\x98 Did he not like you ?â\\x80\\x99 she said; and then she remembered that Clementâ\\x80\\x99s letters had implied some 172 thing of the sort, and stammered, â\\x80\\x98 I beg your pardon.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, simply. â\\x80\\x98Afterwards, too, he felt as if I had robbed him. Was it not unfortunate ? Can you tell me what I ought to have done ? There was no one to advise me ; he would not take it back again. Madame wished to stay, so I stayed ; but if you could persuade himâ\\x80\\x94you are clever and good, and he would listen to youâ\\x80\\x94if he would take it back, and let me go away. Why do you shake your head ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Clement would not listen ; and he ought not. No, Ursule ; if my father were here, I am sure he would tell you that all this has not come by your own seeking, and that you should not make yourself miserable about it ; only try to do your best, and bear patiently what must be a trial. Put yourself in Clementâ\\x80\\x99s place : donâ\\x80\\x99t you see how impossible it would be for you to accept such a gift ? One oâ\\x80\\x99clock ! I had no idea it was so late ! I must go at once.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule looked gratefully after the small, alert figure, as it hurried along the road; but she did not know that the con 172 versation had cost Joyce more than common spmpathy, or had won her a faithful friend. The thoughts which battled in Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s heart had been very conflicting ; now they were settling down into a steady renunciation of self. Pity for the lonely girl, who carried so brave a face through her troubles, would alone have been sufficient to appeal to her generous nature ; added to it was a real liking, a wish to help her to the utmost of her powerÂ» and a strong desire to shake her cousins into a little display of3^4 ONE YEAR. cordiality towards the innocent invader. But, somehow or other, she felt a conviction that Bella, with all her professed liking,\\'was at the bottom of Mrs. Chambersâ\\x80\\x99s falling off. â\\x80\\x98Silly little woman,â\\x80\\x99 thought Joyce, contemptuously, â\\x80\\x98to be influenced by a girl like that ! I would not take any trouble in the matterâ\\x80\\x94 Ursule is better without herâ\\x80\\x94if she did not evidently feel hurt, and if Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny did not throw it in her teeth when 172 ever she is affronted. And I dare say that, after all, Bella said nothing absolutely untrueâ\\x80\\x94only put Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s belongings in the worst light. Well, we shall see.â\\x80\\x99 Tuesday came, the day of the dinner-party, and Joyce could not help feeling amused at the commotion created by the event. Even calm, unruffled Miss Villars went backwards and forwards between store-room and china-closet with unflagging persistency; and when the best dinner-set and the branch candlesticks had been carefully carried into the light of day, there were dried fruits glittering with candy, and luscious spoonfuls of guava jelly, and snowy piles of blanched almonds to be turned out in little heaps, into the middle of which, every now and then, Rose would make a foray, and go away with sticky fingers and the spoil, which Miss Villars had not the heart to refuse her darling. â\\x80\\x98I like parties; and Cooper has promised me some jelly,â\\x80\\x99 she announced, complacently. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, dear !â\\x80\\x99 sighed Anne. â\\x80\\x98 This is one of the dreadful days of oneâ\\x80\\x99s life.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Think of me, with the Miss Hamiltons to entertain in the drawing-room before you come up ! â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, in a pathetic tone. â\\x80\\x98 Great bear, middle bear, and little bear !â\\x80\\x99 soliloquised Joyce, mischievously.THE DINNER-PARTY. â\\x80\\x98That is all very fine for you, who donâ\\x80\\x99t mind such things.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But I do mind. I have just discovered there are seven bows to be made up for my dress, before I can wear it ; and if there is a thing I hate, it is making bows.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 By the way, Anne, you never sent for the ribbon that Aunt Clare said you wanted for your hair.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What is the good ? It does not matter in the least what I wear.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Hear her ! Which of us can so afford to be independent of external improvements ? â\\x80\\x99 Anne looked distressed. She never quite understood Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s waysâ\\x80\\x94how much was serious, and how much play. â\\x80\\x98 You know I donâ\\x80\\x99t mean that â\\x80\\x99 she began. â\\x80\\x98 That none of us can afford to inflict ourselves upon society unadorned, is what Joyce means,â\\x80\\x99 explained Elsie. â\\x80\\x98 But I sup 172 pose I have an extra share of vanity ; for I am sure it would be a real pleasure to myself to feel nicely dressed. I like it, with 172 out thinking of other people.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, dear ! what is the difference ? â\\x80\\x99 repeated Anne. 1 1 can 172 not understand why one should care about the outward look of things.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Love of beauty and want of perception of it,â\\x80\\x99 Joyce thought to herself. â\\x80\\x98Well, Anne,â\\x80\\x99 she said aloud, â\\x80\\x98 I would rather live in Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s world than yours. If you had the colouring of it, good-bye to everything but horrid drabs and browns.â\\x80\\x99 Anne looked shocked, this time. It seemed to her as if her cousin sometimes bordered on irreverence. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Joyce ! â\\x80\\x99 And Joyce answered by taking her by the shoulders and bestowing one of those shakes with which she often longed to favour the whole Elmwood society.3 66 ONE YEAR. The hours wore away, and brought Anneâ\\x80\\x99s ordeal nearer and nearer. Ursule, at the Cottage, stitched away at the dress which the carrier had brought, after a different fashion than Cinderellaâ\\x80\\x99s fairy godmother; and Madame, from her sofa, watched, and scolded, and criticised. Clement, who was to dine and sleep at the Rectory, walked whistling to the station, thinking that it was always a pleasant thing to be going to an old home. Joyce hurried through her dressing, rushed into Anneâ\\x80\\x99s room, dragged down her hair, in spite of protestations, and twisted in some natural sprays of ivy with such good effect that Anne, looking in the glass in dismay, declared she did not know herself ; and her cousin was obliged to deliver her into Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s charge, with orders to watch that she did not spoil it all by squeezing her head into its usual shape. By-and-bye the guests began to arrive, Mr. Follaton, roused into a perception of his duties as host, receiving them all with an old-fashioned courtesy which was charming. Anne, even when supported by Joyce, was too little at ease to look any 172 thing but uncomfortable. Nevertheless, she managed to get through the hand-shakings without finding herself in trouble ; and when she was able to take refuge in a corner, where no one in particular required talking to, Joyce felt tolerably satisfied about her. The party was not really alarmingâ\\x80\\x94one or two of the neigh 172 bouring clergymen, with their wives and daughters, a naval captain and his son, and Mr. and Mrs. Chambers. As it hap 172 pened, at dinner Joyce found herself sitting next to Clement; and his first question was about Ursule. â\\x80\\x98 I thought she was to be here,â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98She is coming, with two or three others, in the evening. There were too many duty-debts to be paid off, for there to beTHE DINNER PARTY. 367 room at dinner; and Miss Villars would not let me give up my place.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I should think not ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I wish she could have dined with us.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then you like her ? â\\x80\\x99 Clement said, eagerly. â\\x80\\x98Yes, indeed, very, very much;â\\x80\\x99 and the words were spoken without any effort. â\\x80\\x98 Poor little thing ! what a change these few months have made in her life!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Do you think she is reconciled to it?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Scarcely. France is still the sunshiny home, and this the one that is to be endured. But, if she could feel herself favoured with a little liking, it might be different. I am out of all patience with Mrs. Chambers.â\\x80\\x99 And then she told him the whole story. â\\x80\\x98 Mrs. Chambers could not have changed without some reason, however poor a one,â\\x80\\x99 she said ; â\\x80\\x98 and although I have not great foundations for my idea, I am inclined to suspect Bella of interference.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, no ; you are too hard upon Bella,â\\x80\\x99 said Clement. â\\x80\\x98 What motive could she have had ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98The motive of an underhand nature,â\\x80\\x99 retorted Joyce. â\\x80\\x98You donâ\\x80\\x99t expect me to read all its riddles, do you ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I should like to catch her at such work ! But no, Joyce, you are putting it too strong.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98We shall see.â\\x80\\x99 With which oracular prophecy, in which she was apt to indulge, the subject dropped. Upstairs, after dinner, they found Elsie, Bella, Ursule, and two or three other young ladies, who had been persuaded to come in a friendly way in the evening. Ursule looked very pretty and bright in her black dress, with nothing in her hair bul the ribbon fillet tied daintily on one side, and her eyes spark ling with amusement at the girlish chatter round her. Joyce,3 63 ONE YEAR. watching Mrs. Chambers, saw her glance towards her with ad 172 miration, and half move as if she was going to speak ; but Bella brought some work forward for her to see, and she contented herself with a bow. There was rather a wearisome time of ordinary chatter, looking at photograph-books, and an attempt and failure on the part of Miss Villars to provide two of the clergymenâ\\x80\\x99s wives with servants ; then the gentlemen came up 172 stairs, and the conversation brightened. Mr. Blunt talked a great deal to Elsie; but then, as Joyce noticed, Ursule was sitting very near, and he managed that she should not feel shut out. Presently Elsie and Bella played a duet, and one of the Miss Hamiltons sang a song, of which the sentiments were not very intelligible; and Joyce, looking at the timepiece, saw with despair that the evening was passing away, and she had done nothingâ\\x80\\x94found out nothing about Mrs. Chambers and her fickleness. At last chance favoured her, or rather Mrs. Cham 172 bers herself. She rose up, and came over to the table where Joyce was standing, showing some curious foreign prints to Captain Bryce. â\\x80\\x98 Miss Clayton,â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98 have Anne and Elsie infected you with unsociableness, that you have not yet found your way to the Hall?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I scarcely knew whether you would remember me,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, frankly. â\\x80\\x98 When may I come ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Whenever you like. Will some morning suit you ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I generally go to the Cottage in the morning. I am glad to see as much of Ursule as possible.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Chambers looked surprised. â\\x80\\x98 Then your mother does not object ? â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98To what?â\\x80\\x99 asked Joyce, puzzled in her turn.THE DINNER-PARTY. 369 â\\x80\\x98To your associating with Mademoiselle Lafon ? Personally,â\\x80\\x99 she went on hurriedlyâ\\x80\\x94\\' personally I admire her exceedingly. I thought her quite an acquisition to the neighbourhood ; delight 172 fully fresh and unconventional. I really hoped and intended to see a great deal of her. But then, when one heard that her father was so dreadful, and that altogether she was of such low origin that Miss Villars did not wish the girls to be intimate with her, what was one to do ? I am not sufficiently superior to such prejudices as to go against them,â\\x80\\x99 she said, with a smile; â\\x80\\x98 and I thought that really the best thing was to draw back at once. It surprised me to see her here to-night.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 May I inquire who gave you your information ? â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, feeling as if enlightenment was coming. â\\x80\\x98 Bella told me about it. I forget what brought it out. Oh, I remember ! It was by way of excuse for her sisters, when I accused them of not sufficiently cultivating Mademoiselle La- fonâ\\x80\\x99s acquaintance. And then it struck me that she had never told me anything about her family. Naturally she was ashamed, poor girl ; but, at the same time, her silence formed conclusive evidence.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Chambers paused, rather pleased with her own winding up. Joyce was too indignant to be careful over her words. â\\x80\\x98 I am sure it did not,â\\x80\\x99 she said. * I beg your pardonâ\\x80\\x94I mean that I think you are mistaken ; she is not in the least ashamed of people knowing all about her. I am quite certain she would have been glad to have talked to you about her friends.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Not if they were in a different rank of life from all of us.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I doubt whether, until it was put into her head, she would have thought it mattered in the least.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Depend upon it you are mistaken. That is a lesson soon learnt in the world.â\\x80\\x9937Â° ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 She is thoroughly simple-minded and humble. All kindness she takes as pure kindness, without a thought of pretension to what she is not entitled.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Chambers still looked incredulous. â\\x80\\x98May I try to prove it?â\\x80\\x99 asked Joyce, smiling. â\\x80\\x98 Yes, do ! â\\x80\\x99 Their conversation had been carried on in under-tones. Captain Bryce, in giving way to Mrs. Chambers, had turned to Ursule, who was talking to him with animation, and assisting her meaning with graceful gestures, which made the old sailor smile kindly into the pleasant face, thinking that it was one to brighten home, and that he would not object to his Charlie bringing home such another to the old place. But he was doomed to interruptions in his talk that night; for Joyce, as if she were taking up the thread which had been dropped, recalled his attention to the pictures. â\\x80\\x98 There are a good many of all sorts in this portfolio,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98Ursule, can you undo the knot? Some are good; others very much the reverse.â\\x80\\x99 She turned them over as she spoke ; and one or two, who were attracted by the prospect of something to look at, came to enlarge the group at the table. Bella stood by Mrs. Chambers, watching with a little anxiety whether she spoke to Ursule. Clement also looked on curiously. Captain Bryce shook his head over a sea-piece. â\\x80\\x98 With the wind in that quarter, no sea could strike a vessel in such a fashion as this ; but then, to be sure, there was never such rigging seen, except in a fancy picture.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98This is a good painting, I believe,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, taking up a soft, misty Scotch landscape ; â\\x80\\x98 but, indeed, I am very ignorant about their respective merits. I only know which please myTHE DINNER-PARTY. 371 fancy, and which do not. Ursule, you will be able to explain : come and take my place as show-womtm.â\\x80\\x99 * Is Miss Lafon an artist ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Captain Bryce. â\\x80\\x98How thoughtless of Joyce!â\\x80\\x99 whispered Bella to Mrs. Chambers. â\\x80\\x98She might have avoided such a question being asked.â\\x80\\x99 The whisper was loud, and it reached Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s ears as she passed behind them. A colour came into her cheeks ; but she stood upright by the table, and said in a distinct voice, â\\x80\\x98 I myself only draw a little ; but my father gained his bread by painting. He was a poor artist. It is not always easy to sell pictures, and they were our only support.â\\x80\\x99 Something resolute in the girlâ\\x80\\x99s manner struck those who were listening to her little explanation. â\\x80\\x98 By Jove ! â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Chambers, leaning over his wife, â\\x80\\x98 she could not have said it more proudly if he had been president of the Academy ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, artists are great people,â\\x80\\x99 said good-natured Captain Bryce, afraid that he had brought annoyance on his little friend. â\\x80\\x98 But my father was not a great man,â\\x80\\x99 gravely answered Ursule; â\\x80\\x98 he was very poor. I would rather you understood,â\\x80\\x99she added, still standing by the table, and looking this time at Mrs. Chambers. Clement rose up, and stood there too. â\\x80\\x98 If you like sea- pieces, Captain Bryce,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98 come to my lodgings in Def- forton, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll show you a sea you wonâ\\x80\\x99t find fault with, painted by Monsieur Lafon.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Go round and speak to her, Helen,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Chambers, in an under-tone to his wife. â\\x80\\x98 I like the girl for saying that out, without humbug.â\\x80\\x99 One or two of the ladies had been a little shocked at the 24â\\x80\\x942372 ONE YEAR. scene, and at Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s straightforward speech, which they thought must have been very disagreeable to Miss Villars in her own house. But, as it happened, Miss Villars and Mr. Follaton were among the few people in the room who had heard nothing of what passed ; and when Mrs. Chambers went up to Ursule, and talked with more cordiality than she had shown to any one else that night, their opinions changed, and they agreed that, after all, her being French made a difference. And so it came to pass that on every side Ursule met with looks of satisfaction, and was treated something like a heroine. Clement stood by her; and Joyce smiled when she met her eye ; and Elsie gave a gasp of pleasure at the honesty so congenial to her own charac 172 ter. Ursule did not understand it ; but she was not of a nature to pull her enjoyment to pieces : she accepted it as something very pleasantâ\\x80\\x94more pleasant than ever, because, from what Madame had told her, she fancied that what she said would have turned people from her. On the contrary, her simple, unpretending manner captivated them, and under no other circumstances could the announcement have made so little impression. Mrs. Chambers took Joyce aside just before she went away. â\\x80\\x98 I was wrong ; but I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind,â\\x80\\x99 she said, with a laughing determination to have been in the right somehow. â\\x80\\x98 I was sure she was nice from the first; and you see Frank is quite de 172 lighted with her behaviour to-night. But do just tell me, what about the father? Is he so dreadful?â\\x80\\x99 * He is idle, and neglected his children ; and that is all that I or anybody else here can tell you about him. I am confident of it, because I have asked Clement and Elsie.â\\x80\\x99 * Then what did that child mean by leading me to suppose he was a thorough scamp ? â\\x80\\x99THE DINNER-PARTY. 373 Joyce shrugged her shoulders. She was very pitiless to Bella. â\\x80\\x98 It must have been a great exaggeration on her part, at all events,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98 Horrid little thing ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Chambers, glad to lay the blame on other shoulders. And when she wished Bella good night, she said, â\\x80\\x98 Pray be more careful of what you say of people another time. You have thoroughly misled me about Mademoi 172 selle Lafon.â\\x80\\x99 Miss Villars, Joyce, Elsie, Clement, Mr. Chambers, heard. Bella grew crimson. She would have burst into tears, had she not been afraid of exciting still more attention. The inquiring looks fastened upon her made her feel ready to sink into the groundâ\\x80\\x94she ! who of all persons craved to please others, and be what she called popular. It was not the fault, but the publicity which distressed her, until she caught her auntâ\\x80\\x99s sorrowful, questioning look, and then there came a rush of more wholesome shame. She went out of the room and up-stairs, avoiding Cle 172 mentâ\\x80\\x99s indignant face and Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s unconscious remarks ; while the others remained in the hall, seeing Ursule depart under Sarahâ\\x80\\x99s guardianship, and Clement walked out to open the gate. The girls lit their candles, and went away to their rooms, Anne in high delight that the dreaded evening was past. But when they wished their cousin good night, both cried out together, â\\x80\\x98 How pale you look ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am very tired,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, briefly. â\\x80\\x98 Good night.â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER XXI. PROVED. I praise the instinct that can turn From vain pretence with proud disdain; Yet more I prize the simple heart, Paying credulity with pain. Adelaide Proctor. what all this means? What made Mrs. Chambers speak so strangely to Bella? Her sisters say they do not know, and did not like to ask you last night, because you looked so tired ; but I shall be so much obliged if you can tell me. I lay awake for hours last night, thinking of a hundred dreadful things.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Have you asked Bella herself?â\\x80\\x99 inquired Joyce, reluctantly. â\\x80\\x98That is what distresses me so muchâ\\x80\\x94I mean that she will not let me come near her. Nothing is so painful as that they should avoid me, as if they were afraid. I cannot bear to think that I may be over-severe.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, dear! oh, dear!â\\x80\\x99 groaned Joyce to herself; for poorPROVED. 375 Miss Villars had tears in her eyes at the idea of her excessive strictness. â\\x80\\x98You have no conception of the immense responsibility which lies upon me in this position,â\\x80\\x99 she continued, talking to Joyce as if she were a much older person. â\\x80\\x98 I fall into so many mistakes, which naturally make themselves felt upon the poor girls.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I cannot help it,â\\x80\\x99 thought Joyce; â\\x80\\x98it is better she should know what her paragon Bella is like, than go on being deceived.â\\x80\\x99 And she told Miss Villars the whole story. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Joyce, there must have been some blunder ! She must have heard a wrong story from some one. She likes Ursule so much ; she would have been the last to have said anything which could do her harm ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Miss Villars, greatly distressed â\\x80\\x98Perhaps she likes Mrs. Chambers better,â\\x80\\x99 answered Joyce, thinking that, probably, she liked a little grandeur best of all. â\\x80\\x98 Probably she misunderstood what I heard from Clement : very often I make mistakes. I am sure it can have been nothing but a misunderstanding.â\\x80\\x99 Her soft blue eyes were full of tears : she looked thoroughly shocked and upset; but it was more at the idea that Bella should have been suspected of deceit, than from admitting the possibi 172 lity of her having acted in the manner they believed. Joyce felt herself to be in a false position, and pitied Miss Villars ; but she thought her very weak, and she had little compassion for Bella. â\\x80\\x98 She must have known that you did not discourage intimacy with Ursule, at all events.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Of course, that was a mistake of Mrs. Chambers. My dear, we must set this right at once : the poor child cannot remain376 ONE YEAR. under such an imputation. What shall I do ? What will it be best to do for her ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You must ask Mrs. Chambers, I suppose,â\\x80\\x99 answered Joyce, in despair of Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s being ever regarded as anything but a victim. â\\x80\\x98Thank you. Yes; that will certainly, under the circum 172 stances, be the most straightforward course. I will go there, I think, to-morrow morning.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And take Bella ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I do not know. Is that advisable ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You are the best judge, Miss Villars.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My dear, it seems to me as if I could not judge in the case at all. The bare idea of her being supposed capable of such conduct is so exceedingly painful. Ought she to go ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If she did not say it, donâ\\x80\\x99t you think she would be glad to defend herself?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes, indeed, poor dear ! Then we will go together. When Miss Villars left her room, Joyce remained in a state of impatience. She was exceedingly clear-sighted ; so much so, that it made her angry to see other people imposed upon ; and she was very angry now. She had brought a prejudice against Bella with her to Elmwood ; all that she had seen there con 172 firmed it. This had put the finishing stroke ; and now, instead of blame, Bella would be pettedâ\\x80\\x94almost turned into a suffering heroine by her aunt ! Joyce stood at the window, and looked discontentedly over the garden, with its early spring flowers breaking out of the old-fashioned beds, and a glimmering silver line of sea bordering the meadows, and thought how much there was in the world which wanted setting to rights, and wondered how Mr. Follaton could endure the old high pews and worn-out paving in St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s. She was for going straight to the desiredPROVED. 377 goal, whatever that might be ; and any obstacles in the way could only be disposed of summarilyâ\\x80\\x94that is to say, unsparingly removed. Joyce had lately been fighting a battle with her own heart, and had, so far, won the victory ; but that very conquest made her inclined to be severe in judging othersâ\\x80\\x94inclined to grant them no favour which she had not permitted to herself. The world wanted setting to rights, and people were content to poke on with it all wrong !â\\x80\\x94that was the present verdict of her mind. No one had the energy to stand up and say that St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s ought to be restored ; and no one would have the energy to make Bella feel how cruelly she had acted. It was a little consolation, when Anne and Elsie came in, to find them agreed, at all events, upon the latter point. Elsie was as indignant as Joyce; Anne indignant too, but more inclined to mercy. â\\x80\\x98 She might have said it without thinking,â\\x80\\x99 she pleaded. â\\x80\\x98 She must have known she was exaggerating.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What makes it so horrid,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, â\\x80\\x98 is that she really pro 172 fessed to be more friendly with Mademoiselle Lafon than any of us. I feel as if I should be ashamed to look her in the face.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Miss Villars cannot believe it,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce. â\\x80\\x98 Can she not ? There, Anne, what did I tell you ? Aunt Clare will never listen to a word against Bella.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t much think she will hear a word against any of you,â\\x80\\x99 Joyce responded. â\\x80\\x98No; it is quite true. I am sure we donâ\\x80\\x99t get pulled up enough. I pull up Anne, which, you see, is a great advantage to her ; but as to the rest of the family, papa doesnâ\\x80\\x99t notice, and Aunt Clare thinks we must all be charming ; and soâ\\x80\\x94I acknow 172 ledge, Joyce, a periodical visit from you is very advantageous to our morals.â\\x80\\x9937^ ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 Thank you ! * â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I mean it, I assure you ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I dare say ; only just now we were talking about Bella.â\\x80\\x99 Anne twisted herself uncomfortably on a chair. â\\x80\\x98 If papa would only understand and speak, she would attend to him ; but if Aunt Clare does not believe it, he would think it was all a mistake. I am afraid that poor Bella has been giving way to small equivocations and deceits of late, until she scarcely knows what she does.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Have you said anything to her ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No; she will not give me the opportunity: she just looks exceedingly hurt and offended, and before I can get it out she is gone.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If I get the chance, I shall tell her my opinion,â\\x80\\x99Joyce said, decidedly. â\\x80\\x98 As to Ursule, did she not behave well last night ? She spoke out without an atom of false shame.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Y es,â\\x80\\x99 answered Elsie, in a meditative tone ; â\\x80\\x98 I think I am beginning to like her. I was grateful to her for taking two Miss Hamiltons off my hands.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then pray let your gratitude show itself. You owe her a great deal.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 On account of Bella ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 On account of yourselves.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What do you mean ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Elsie, impatiently. * A poor girl comes here as an utter stranger ; she knows no 172 thing of the place, nothing of the people, nothing of so much as the most ordinary customs. She is young, very lonely, and has just gone through a great griefâ\\x80\\x94circumstances which are generally supposed to require sympathy. Certainly, you have not thrown stones at her ; but I donâ\\x80\\x99t fancy there is very much more to be said.â\\x80\\x99PROVED. 379 â\\x80\\x98Oh, Joyce !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My dear Anne, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it true ? â\\x80\\x99 Anne was silent ; Elsie tapped her foot on the ground. â\\x80\\x98 Well, donâ\\x80\\x99t let us talk about it any more,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, wearily. â\\x80\\x98 I dare say it will all come right in the end.â\\x80\\x99 She felt as if it was hard that she must be always Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s champion ; she was worried with all of themâ\\x80\\x94with herself more than all, because she could not shake off the longing to set things to rightsâ\\x80\\x94the old snare which had its mixture of good and evil, its difficulties of judgment, its ill-defined boundaries between what should be done and left undone. â\\x80\\x98 Miss Villars is going to take Bella to Mrs. Chambers,â\\x80\\x99 she said, putting her jacket carefully into a drawer. â\\x80\\x98Then I think that is utterly ridiculous,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, vehe 172 mently, a bright colour flashing into her cheek. â\\x80\\x98It is bad enough, in all conscience, that she should have behaved in such a manner, without its being proclaimed to the world further than is necessary. Mrs. Chambers has been very silly about it in listening to Bella ; and now I suppose she will take up Ursule, and be wonderfully affectionate, praise her to everybody, and say, in her way, as if she could make no mistakes, â\\x80\\x9c I always liked her, but I was misinformed by Bella Clayton.â\\x80\\x9d Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it horrid that people should think we could have been so dis 172 honourable ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It isnâ\\x80\\x99t that,â\\x80\\x99 said Anne, speaking eagerly, and letting her words tumble into a confused tangleâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 not about us, but about the deceit, the wrong-doing. Think if she will not care â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She will care for the shame.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes; but is that right? I mean,â\\x80\\x99 continued Anne, â\\x80\\x98it is only shame, after all.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98It is shame for us as well, and I do think Aunt Clare ought380 ONE YEAR. not to make matters worse by going to Mrs. Chambers,â\\x80\\x99 inter 172 rupted Elsie, her cheeks still aflame. â\\x80\\x98 I should think a decided punishment would have been better than all this trying to get out of a fact which has been proved,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, forgetful that one of her aims had been to uphold Miss Villarsâ\\x80\\x99s authority. It is just like Aunt Clareâ\\x80\\x99s indecision ! â\\x80\\x99 Anne looked pained ; she was not following the same train of thought as the others. Joyce was a little indignant that, having brought the matter to a crisis and made it clear to the feeblest perception, there should yet remain a doubt in favour of the culprit, and a desire for her escape. Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s pride was touched on a sore pointâ\\x80\\x94family credit. Her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s fault was very great, and ought to be visited upon her ; but it was hard that it should be visited in this way : she did not like it to be said that one of the Miss Follatons had behaved ungenerously. Self had a part in the meditations of both Elsie and Joyce; but, with Anne, there was only the sad, tender yearning over the sister whom her mother had charged her, when she lay upon her death-bed, with faint, loving words, to watch over and to guide. Anne cared little for the blame which might fall upon them, less for being proved in the right ; but she cared deeply that Bella should see to what the fault she gave way to daily in small degrees would most assuredly lead her : she looked to the Beyond, while the others were taken up with the present ; and though she felt the sin the most, she was also the most charitable to the sinner. An uncomfortable silence fell upon the three cousins as each pursued their separate thought. Elsie wondered why they had gone into Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s room, and Joyce wished she might be left in peace for a little while.PROVED. 33i â\\x80\\x98 Is Clement gone ? â\\x80\\x99 she asked. * He went to the Cottage after service. He had scarcely time before the train started ; but he seemed to think Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Au- rigny would be disappointed if she did not see him. Certainly he is an excellent nephew ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Excellent ! â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, dryly. Elsie looked at her in surprise. An hour ago the sad, solemn service had brought home to each of them high thoughts of better thingsâ\\x80\\x94Elsie had longed to be more patient, and Joyce to be more humbleâ\\x80\\x94and now, it seemed as if the thoughts had flown, and they were left irritable and out of sorts. Each had a perception that it was so, and felt uneasy; and it was a relief when Miss Villars was heard calling her nieces, and they could separate for a little while. The day dragged by heavily. Bella preserved an angry silence, inaccessible alike to Miss Villarsâ\\x80\\x99s more than usually kindliness of manner, as if she desired to make up to her for the burden of an unjust accusation, and to the indignant looks of Joyce and Elsie. Towards the former she was simply ungracious ; towards the latter, defiant. During the day she kept herself as closely as possible in the school-room; in the evening, she would not make any attempt to join in the conversation. Miss Villars could not tell whether she wished to see Mrs. Chambers or not : her * Dearest, we will go together, and then you can explain all that you wish,â\\x80\\x99 had been answered only by a short â\\x80\\x98Very well.â\\x80\\x99 On the next morning she looked pale and heavy 172 eyed, going about with the air of a victim, which it smote Miss Villars to notice. She could not do too much to show her entire faith in her truth ; and Joyce impatiently wondered at her blindness, and took no pains to conceal her own opinion of Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s conduct.382 ONE YEAR. About eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock the pair set out. They were alone ; but this was from no wish of Miss Villars : she would have liked all to be there, to hear Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s justification. Singularly enough, she had not asked for it herself : she had put one simple question, and when it had been answered by Bella that it was all a mistake, she remained quite content, and confident in her darling. It was not suspicion which prevented her from being cheerful during the walk ; it was the girlâ\\x80\\x99s own gloominess, which she believed to proceed from the unjust things said of her, and only deserved to be charmed away by extra kindness and confidence. The morning was soft and genial : a hopeful whiff of spring came now and then in the air ; the birds sang, and chirped, and twittered, and busied themselves with all their little might in house-building ; the branches were thick and red with buds ; everything seemed to be putting forth its strength to escape from the bondage of winter. Their way led by the Cottage gateâ\\x80\\x94where Jock lay lazily blinking his eyes, and just acknowledging the rights of acquaint 172 anceship by a feeble flap of his tailâ\\x80\\x94and so on to the harbour, across the road where the sea had played such havoc, and little Phil Blakeâ\\x80\\x99s life had been in sore peril. Now it was mended, the brown stream danced as merrily as ever down the meadows, and under the road, into the basin ; and the waters, which, for many weeks, lay like a broad lake within the em 172 bankment, had left it green again. Nothing marked the mis 172 chief of that great tide, except an uneven, rough patch of stones where the hole had been filled up. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, dear ! I shall never come here without thinking of Clement,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Villars. Bella only sidled a little further off. She remembered Clementâ\\x80\\x99s look when she met him in the hall the precedingPROVED. 383 night, and a flood of angry shame came over her at the recol 172 lection. She walked on sullenly, every step bringing a greater dread of what she was going to encounter ; and if any plausible excuse for escaping the ordeal could have presented itself, she would have grasped it eagerly. Her auntâ\\x80\\x99s confidence touched her in spite of herself ; those soft, kindly eyes, with their burden of undoubting love, were more unbearable than the sharpest words of reproach. Sometimes it seemed impossible to go on ; she felt as if she must stop, confess that she had indeed said all that was attributed to her, and have done with it. But it was not the character of her mind to be brave, or to face boldly what might be postponedâ\\x80\\x94what might by some unforeseen acci 172 dent be set on one side altogether. Supposing that Mrs. Cham 172 bers were not at home ; then, at all events, the evil hour must be delayed ; and, while she was, for a time, spared general exposure, there was, moreover, a hope that the fuss would die away. Other things would assert their importance, and her fault be forgotten. Silently, since Bella would not speak, aunt and niece made their way along a bleak, desolate road, bordered with salt-pools and patches of fleshy glasswort, until they turned upwards into a broad picturesque lane, so thickly set with trees that in the summer it was one long, unbroken glade, and, by a little gate, entered the Hall grounds. Up and up, as they went, the view became more beautiful, and, February as it was, it was like a summer picture to see the calm blue water between the trees, beyond a foreground of emerald-hued grass. Bella did not look up, but dragged one step after the other so slowly, that Miss Villars questioned her as to fatigue, and suggested asking Mrs. Chambers for a glass of wine. â\\x80\\x98 Of course, my dear, it is satisfactory to you to come your 172 self ; but, at the same time, I am afraid you are over-tiredd3 8 4 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 I canâ\\x80\\x99t help it,â\\x80\\x99 said Bella, in an aggrieved tone. â\\x80\\x98No; it would be impossible for any of us to rest until this is set right ; yet, at the same time, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know, I am sureâ\\x80\\x94 I almost wish â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 That no notice had been taken of it. My dear, Mrs. Chambersâ\\x80\\x99s acknowledgment will not add a straw to my con 172 victions.â\\x80\\x99 As she spoke, she took the girlâ\\x80\\x99s hand, and looked kindly into her face. Bella shuddered, and withdrew her hand. â\\x80\\x98 Aunt Clare,â\\x80\\x99 she began rapidly ; then she stopped. She had been on the very verge of confession when her courage failed her. â\\x80\\x98I wonder which is worse,â\\x80\\x99 she thought, â\\x80\\x98for papa to know all, or for me to encourage Aunt Clareâ\\x80\\x99s belief, and allow her to look at me in that trusting fashion.â\\x80\\x99 She stood still momentarily by the side of a noble cedar, and glanced again at her aunt with a half-purpose. Then she laid it aside, and walked on. â\\x80\\x98 After all,â\\x80\\x99 she said to herself, â\\x80\\x98 there are a hundred chances : she may be out, or in a good-humoured mood. I dare say I shall get\\'out of the scrape somehow; and, then, wonâ\\x80\\x99t I be careful to keep clear of such another for the future ! â\\x80\\x99 Poor Bella ! It was pitiful to see how all her trouble sprang from one sourceâ\\x80\\x94the horror of being known to have spoken falsely. Over and over again she repeated to herself that, if this was passed over, she would be more particularâ\\x80\\x94break off the habit, in short. And perhaps she flattered herself that this was repentance. It was certainly sorrow of a certain kind ; and it contained a good resolution of a certain kind. But it was not repentance. She was angry with herself for having been imprudent ; she was sorry that her imprudence had come back upon her ; she was determined to be more heedful anotherPROVED. 385 time. All this was not to repent. And the only time when something like a real perception of her fault swept over her was after one of her auntâ\\x80\\x99s loving speeches. She half despised her for her perfect trust ; but it stung her deeply to think it was undeserved. Mrs. Chambers was at home, and Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s heart sank. The footman ushered them into a pretty south room, bright with every possible device to preserve its summer cheerfulnessâ\\x80\\x94sunny water-colours on the walls, fancifully flowered chintzes, bits of exquisite china scattered about, and a stand of glowing spring flowers, tulips, crocuses, and hyacinths, growing out of a deep bed of moss, and almost dazzling the eye with their gorgeous 172 ness. The room was empty, a brisk fire burning, a low arm 172 chair drawn near it, and a tiny Skye terrier ensconced in the chair. Bella stood by the table, nervously turning over the magazines heaped upon it, and wishing with all her heart that she had had sufficient courage to acknowledge the truth of what had been said, and escape the dreaded interview. Every mo 172 ment she fancied she heard the rustle of a dress in the hall, and the five minutes during which Mrs. Chambers kept them waiting were the longest minutes Bella had ever passed in her life. She came at last, full of apologies and graciousness to Miss Villars, and markedly chilling to her niece. Mrs. Chambers was not a person who easily forgot an offence, and, in this case, listening to Bella had brought upon her one of her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s rare rebukes. He had been struck with Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s manner on the night of the party, had discussed it with his wife during their drive home, and had told her kindly but decidedly that she was silly to have been so easily swayed, and to have treated Ursule in so unjustifiable a manner. Mrs. Chambers had laid the blame on Bella, and was disposed to be indignant, and to 25386 ONE YEAR. regard herself as much a victim as Ursule ; so that when Miss Villars, with a touch of quiet dignity which she could display at times, said that she had come as soon as possible to give Bella an opportunity for explanation, Mrs. Chambers, sinking into her low chair, and taking the dog on her lap, said coolly, â\\x80\\x98 I am delighted to see you, Miss Villars ; but I scarcely see what remains to be explained.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98From what passed the other night, I am afraid you must have carried away a wrong impression of what my niece said with regard to Mademoiselle Lafon.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Hardly a wrong impression : it was not capable of miscon 172 struction.â\\x80\\x99 * Surely,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Villars, looking shocked, â\\x80\\x98 you must have misconstrued it * Bella, dear love, can you remember your exact words ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I said â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, dear?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I only said that Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s father â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Pray go on,â\\x80\\x99 observed Mrs. Chambers sarcastically, as she stopped a second time. â\\x80\\x98 I am sure you said he was a very wicked man,â\\x80\\x99 said Bella, turning piteously to her aunt. â\\x80\\x98 You informed me that he was a man so bad, such a mauvais sujet, in fact,â\\x80\\x99 remarked Mrs. Chambers, â\\x80\\x98that, added to the fact of Mademoiselle Lafonâ\\x80\\x99s position in life being of the lowest, your aunt did not like you or your sisters to associate with her. You remember, I am sure.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Bella,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Villars, in great distress, â\\x80\\x98 what could you have said to be so mistaken ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, it was no mistake, if that is what you fancy, dear Miss Villars. My memory never fails me, and I could repeat thePROVED. 387 very words. Dear me, Bella,â\\x80\\x99 continued Mrs. Chambers, who was very unsparing to other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s faults, â\\x80\\x98 why do you try to twist your meaning into anything else ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Tell us what it was, my dear child,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Villars, still looking at her. She was silent. The brim of her hat hid her face from her aunt. â\\x80\\x98 What was it you meant to say ? â\\x80\\x99 This time she looked up ; an excuse trembled on her tongue, when she caught her auntâ\\x80\\x99s yearning look of love : the words died away, she covered her face with her hands, and burst into tears. â\\x80\\x98 I wishâ\\x80\\x94I wish she had never come here,â\\x80\\x99 she sobbed out. There was a dead silence. Mrs. Chambers felt uncomfortable, and occupied herself with the dog in her lap. She had some sort of perception of the shock it must be to Miss Villars, and avoided looking at her. Presently she heard one word uttered in the stillnessâ\\x80\\x94one word, full of sorrowing, pitying reproachâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Bella ! â\\x80\\x99 Only sobs answered. Mrs. Chambers, almost burying her face in her favouriteâ\\x80\\x99s long hair, could see that Miss Villars had risen, and was standing near her, as if ready to go. She rose also, and tried to murmur something about being sorry ; but the words died away, and Miss Villars spoke with all her old nervous trepidation. â\\x80\\x98 Pray forgive meâ\\x80\\x94forgive us. I would not have intruded upon you at this hour had I known. I thoughtâ\\x80\\x94I believed â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Prayâ\\x80\\x94pray say nothing,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Chambers, much touched. â\\x80\\x98 I am grieved, indeed, to think of that poor girl having suf 172 fered through our means.â\\x80\\x99 25â\\x80\\x9423 88 ONE YEAR. \\' I was hasty also. I ought to have made further inquiries. Dear Miss Villars, do not blame yourself!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah, I must ! â\\x80\\x99 she said, with a sad shake of the head. There was something in the gesture which made it impossible to answer. Mrs. Chambers could but press her hand, and wish Bella good-bye, for her auntâ\\x80\\x99s sake, more kindly than she would have supposed possible a few minutes ago. Bella came away from the table, still sobbing ; she neither looked up nor answered, and the pair walked drearily homewards. Miss Villars did not attempt to break the silence ; but a whole string of reproaches would not have been so bitter as that one sorrowful exclamation. When they reached the Cottage gate, however, she stopped, and said in a low voice, â\\x80\\x98 Will you come with me ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Are you going in ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Bella, with a look of affright. â\\x80\\x98 My dear, I must. It is not right to allow Ursule to suppose that Mrs. Chambers behaved more unkindly than was the case.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You only think of the others ! â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, bitterly. No one could tell what it cost Miss Villars to be firm ; she dared not begin to argue ; she only repeated, â\\x80\\x98 Will you come ? It would be much better.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, thank you. I am going home.â\\x80\\x99 Yet, ungraciously as she spoke, she wished all the time that she had sufficient courage to do as her aunt proposed. Reaching home, she ran up-stairs to her room. Rose, hearing her pass the school-room door, exclaimed to that effect in the middle of a French verb. â\\x80\\x98 She will be here in a few minutes,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Smith, in 172 differently. â\\x80\\x98 Future tense, Rose ? â\\x80\\x99 But as the minutes lengthened, she presently asked one of the sisters to call her.PROVED. 389 â\\x80\\x98 You go, Joyce,â\\x80\\x99 whispered Elsie. â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t like it.â\\x80\\x99 Joyce was not sorry to go. She came into the school-room because her cousins wished to have her ; but there was a rest 172 less, dissatisfied fit upon her which made it a labour to throw herself with any interest into their occupations. Moreover, she wanted to know the result of the morning expedition. When her knock at Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s door had been repeated several times without producing any response, she gently turned the handle and went in. Bella was standing before the glass, drying her eyes. She did not look round as the door opened, but said angrily, â\\x80\\x98 What do you want ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Miss Smith is waiting for you. Shall I say you are not quite ready ? â\\x80\\x99 asked J oyce, kindly ; for she felt pity for the girl after what had evidently been a humiliating morning. â\\x80\\x98 You need not say anythingâ\\x80\\x94no one told you to come inâ\\x80\\x94 I wish you would not meddle ! â\\x80\\x99 cried out Bella, passionately. She believed her cousin to have been, in some inexplicable manner, the cause of all her disgrace. â\\x80\\x98 That is childish,â\\x80\\x99 said J oyce, with coldness. â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t wish to meddle; but I suppose you do not expect me to be quite blind ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t care ! You and Anne and Elsie are all set against me, and you try to set Aunt Clare and papa.â\\x80\\x99 Joyce smiled contemptuously. She thought it was a good time to bestow some home truths. â\\x80\\x98 I tell you what, Bella,â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98 there is not the smallest use in your attempting to play injured innocence before me. Miss Villars is a hundred times too good to you ; and if you have an atom of right feeling in you, you would know it. It was so mean, so ungenerous, to profess friendship for Ursule, and then to turn her friends against3Qo ONE YEAR. her, that I donâ\\x80\\x99t wonder at your feeling ashamedâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t won 172 der at your avoiding us all. I should be very sorry for you, if you were sorry yourself. But if you havenâ\\x80\\x99t even so much generosity as to acknowledge your fault, more shame for you ! â\\x80\\x94that is all I can say.â\\x80\\x99 Bella cowered under her cousinâ\\x80\\x99s words. Joyce, as she stood there, with her little determined figure, her bright indignant eyes, her clear voice, seemed an unsparing accuser, looking into the offenderâ\\x80\\x99s face, and reading all that she would have liked to keep most hidden. Her words were true, but they were very severe. In spite of her manner, in spite of her sullen 172 ness, Bella had been almost yielding : she had longed to pour out her heart to her aunt, to find comfort in the patient kind 172 ness which never failed her ; and having seen her fault more clearly ever since she perceived how deeply it had grieved Miss Villars, she had thought that directly her aunt returned she would go to her and confess how wrongly she had acted. But Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s wrath hardened her again. Back came the angry, stubborn mood ; back came the determination to carry it through with a high hand ; back came all the foolish rage against herself for being found outâ\\x80\\x94for not having managed better. She could not look Joyce in the face, for she had not sufficient courage ; but she answered sharply, â\\x80\\x98 When you have finished, you can tell Miss Smith that I shall come when I please.â\\x80\\x99 And Joyce shut the door indignantly.CHAPTER XXII. CROSS PURPOSES Obc. What hast thou done ? thou hast mistaken quite. Midsummer Nightâ\\x80\\x99s Dream. life, the marked yet harmonious contrast between it, the blue of sky and water, and the ruddy soil, possess a charm which no other season of the year can.exceed. Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s first English spring, in spite of the bitter cold of January, was warm, soft, budding, and all that a spring should be to make it delightful ; nor was ever any one more naturally fitted to enjoy it than the French girl, with her sparkling pleasure at everything that was pretty and bright. With J ock by her side to look up at her now and then with sagacious, faithful eyes, with the sea before her breaking loudly upon the long line of sandy coast, with Joyce often at the cot 172 tage, and Elsie and Anne gradually thawing, her life had many enjoyments, brightening, as she fancied, with the spring. Ma 172 dame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny was more helpless, more suffering, than ever ; but there were not wanting times when, in spite of herself, as it392 ONE YEAR. seemed, she returned, in her own scantier measure, the girlâ\\x80\\x99s lavish affection ; and Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s nature was one of those in which dependence upon her of necessity produced tenderness. Nor could it be denied that the teaching of the past months, sad and severe as at the time it felt, had produced good fruit. Her life might have been that of a butterfly, carelessly content with the present hour, carried just where the stream of wilful self- pleasing would carry her, selfish in her happiness, fitful in her moods, vague and unreal in her dreams of better things. But forced back upon herself, and obliged for a time to remain in the shade, solitary and uncared for, the Divine love which, with unerring wisdom, fits the daily cross, had trained the nobler part of her character to answer to the call. It was not the capricious kindness of a thoughtless girl which now bore so patiently with Madameâ\\x80\\x99s ever-changing fancies; it was not only the ignorant yearning after something high and beautiful which drew her to St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s ; it was not fancy which induced her to study perseveringly, nor sadness which let her yield her will, nor forgetfulness which taught her contentment ; it was something beyond all theseâ\\x80\\x94the learning of the lesson taught unconsciously by Louis on his couch, and brought home to her in the little whitewashed room of the old Norman farm-houseâ\\x80\\x94 the lesson of an everlasting Love. For Joyce the girl had a sort of reverent affection, seldom bestowed upon one of so nearly the same age, although, indeed, Joyce was unfortunate enough to be a good deal older than her years, and, of late, more so than ever. But Ursule looked upon her with deep admiration, grateful for the manner in which straightforward common sense had pushed aside some of the thorns and difficulties gathering thickly in her path, and believ 172 ing implicitly in her schemes, simply owing to unswerving faithCROSS PURPOSES. 393 in a notion that all in which Joyce was interested must turn out a success. Anne and Elsie she tolerated, not daring to make advances towards intimacy, but rather inclined to like the younger sister, and shamefully alive to poor Anneâ\\x80\\x99s external short-comings. But for Joyce ! Ursule thought with a sigh, free from any taint of jealousy, of her own mediocrity by her side ; she was the sympathising confidante in Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s ardent, though imaginary, crusade against the high pews in St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x94imaginary because even Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s courage was not equal to the task of arguing with Mr. Follaton upon the advantage of any 172 thing being changed, which could, by any possibility, remain as it had remained in long years past ; while, as for hints, he took no more notice of them than if, as was very probably the case, he did not hear them. Therefore, though Joyce was not always inclined for the Cottage and Ursule, there was a tranquil satis 172 faction in feeling herself there believed in, looked up to, and accredited with large capacity of excellence. As to Bella, neither Miss Villars nor Joyce could quite make out Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s feelings on the subject. She did not say much, neither did she show any great indignation; but she rather avoided the offender, and certainly sent no particularly friendly message. Naturally, she was not of a very forgiving nature, and it cost her a good deal to attempt to feel kindly in this case. Had the injury come from either of the other sisters, she would not have minded half so much ; but Bella had professed to be fond of herâ\\x80\\x94had gone so far as to kiss herâ\\x80\\x94and she was inclined to look upon her conduct as treacherous, and to resent it. Always apt to judge others by their manner and professions, she could not believe how much of sterling good lay hid under Anneâ\\x80\\x99s and Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s rough coating of awkwardness and indepen 172 dence ; while Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s softer manner had inclined her to believe394 ONE YEAR. that she was infinitely the superior of the sisters. There was a risk now that she would dislike them all, in spite of Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s endeavour to promote more kindly intercourse. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny admired Joyce almost as much as Ursule admired her. Joyce thoroughly understood the art of amusing sick people without wearying themâ\\x80\\x94of producing little subjects of interest, of remembering anecdotes, of being, in short, bright and cheerful, while, at the same time, never wanting in the charm of a sympathetic listener. â\\x80\\x98 Do you see ! she keeps me inside the world,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, one day, praising her to Clement. â\\x80\\x98Inside her heart, I suppose that means,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, smiling and looking well pleased. â\\x80\\x98 She is so fresh ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Delightful ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Nothing gives her trouble.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 That is because she is thorougn.y unselfish.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 As to those others, your cousins, bah ! â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, snapping her fingers contemptuously, â\\x80\\x98 not one of them can compare with her ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No,â\\x80\\x99 replied Clement, a little hesitatingly, â\\x80\\x98 no, certainly ; I do not think any of them can compare with her. However, I did not know that your opinion was so strong.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Do you expect me to proclaim it to her face? No, my nephew, I am too well versed in young girls to turn their heads by over-commendation.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And do you indeed like her ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Mr. Blunt, after a minuteâ\\x80\\x99s pause. â\\x80\\x98 Have I not said so ? 1 like her with all my heart.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 So do I,â\\x80\\x99 said he, in a suppressed voice. Madame looked at him with her keen grey eyes. â\\x80\\x98 Ah ! â\\x80\\x99 sheCROSS PURPOSES 395 exclaimed, with a little shrill cry, â\\x80\\x98it is true, then; it is as I guessed ! â\\x80\\x99 * What have you guessed ? 1 he asked, still in the same low voice, but a happy smile breaking round the corners of his mouth. â\\x80\\x98That you would marry her. Yes, I am never mistaken. And you will really marry her ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If she will marry me. Will she ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No question of that,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, a little bitterly. â\\x80\\x98 So this is the end ! I am too old to go away again, Clement.â\\x80\\x99 He took her hand kindly in his own. Her eyes were full of tears. â\\x80\\x98 I said all that to try you,â\\x80\\x99 she added, in a broken voice â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 to know whether I had guessed rightly. Ah, but I knew it too well. You will not send me away?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You do not think so; you know us better ! â\\x80\\x99 he answered, moved with her emotion. â\\x80\\x98 A cross old woman ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The only being left that belonged to my mother. I shall be vexed with you presently, if you permit such fancies. I repeat, you ought to have proved us by this time.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She has behaved very wellâ\\x80\\x94oh yes ! â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, with a sigh. â\\x80\\x98 My poor Ursule !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Poor Ursule ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, never mind. Does she know it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Not yet. I cannot tell her until I feel my way more securely. I have only your assurance that it must come right,â\\x80\\x99 he said, getting up and pacing about the room. â\\x80\\x98 Well, well, so bestâ\\x80\\x94so best. Do not tell her too abruptly.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, you are right; I shall wait a little.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Let me break it to her first.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, no,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, nuickly ; â\\x80\\x98no one but myself shall do396 ONE YEAR. that : I will have no third person interfere. However, do not be afraid ; you may be quite sure I will be careful.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah, yes ; that is very fine,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame impatiently, as he closed the door behind him, â\\x80\\x98 that is very fine ; but what does he know of a girlâ\\x80\\x99s heart? These men are like the ostrich, which thinks no one can see him because his own head is in the sand. Nevertheless, my poor little Ursule, I shall give thee a word of warning. I lie here on this sofa, but I am not blind. I can see the colour creep into your face, and hear your voice change when my nephewâ\\x80\\x99s step is in the passage ; and what does that mean but the one thing about which silly girls dream ? The world will never grow wiser. I shall do very well with that other ; she has merit, and will treat me with a proper respect. If Sarah lives with us, she will rule her better than Ursule; and I shall insist that she bestows more attention upon the bouilli. Also, it will be a more comme-il-faut marriage for my nephew. Yes ; decidedly, he has acted with prudence. And yet I have the folly to think continually of my poor little Ursule : she will be left all alone. At any rate, she shall know. Yes, Monsieur Clement, whatever you may think on the subject, I am her natural guardian and protector, and I consider it my duty to inform her of your intentions.â\\x80\\x99 Ignorant of Madameâ\\x80\\x99s determination, Mr. Blunt, meanwhile, was inquiring of Sarah where Mademoiselle Lafon could be found, and received for answer the information that, Jock for her companion, she had started, as Sarah presumed, for the shore. He went hurriedly after her across the meadows ; but, as it happened, Sarah was mistaken in her supposition, for Ursule, when she got outside the gate, was seized with a fancy to go and see Bessieâ\\x80\\x99s little sick brother, whom once or twice before she had shyly ventured to visit ; and the cottage whereCROSS PURPOSES. 397 the Webbers lived lay, with one or two others, at the other end of a long deep lane. As she went, she was glad that she had resisted the attraction of the sea. March was drawing to an end ; the trees were breaking into tiny leaves ; black ash buds had stolen out rather before their usual time ; primroses lay in thick clumps on grassy banks ; the hedges were green and soft with dewy depths of feathery moss, starred with lilac periwinkles ; violets looked up shyly from their leaves ; the delicate buds of the wood-sorrel were just beginning to show. Jock pattered along in the water which crept on at the foot of the hedge, and would fain have made his mistress share his delight and walk there too among the grass and the watercresses, but that she would not be per 172 suaded. The air was scented with gorse. Standing still to look and listen, Ursule heard the distant tap of a woodpecker; a squirrel ran along the fence which skirted a plantation ; two wrens called chit-chit to each other across the road. â\\x80\\x98 Everything is singing in its heart,â\\x80\\x99 she said, and presently began to sing, too, a sailorâ\\x80\\x99s song which she had caught from hearing the fishermen sing it by the harbourâ\\x80\\x94a song about stormy seas and wild winds, and the wives at home waiting and prayingâ\\x80\\x94as great a contrast as possible, it seemed, to the quiet peacefulness around her. The lane was part of an old Roman road, and ran along for miles. As to the Webbersâ\\x80\\x99 cottage, that, and another by its side, stood in a spot where the road opened back a little, and so made space for the solitary houses. Ursule paused at the door of the first, with a shy reluctance to knock, which arose from her feeling herself still so much of a stranger at Elmwood, that she almost despaired of being welcome anywhere; and Bessieâ\\x80\\x99s mother, though a sturdy, independent woman, was not one particularly easy of access. She was, however, on this398 ONE YEAR. occasion in a softened mood, and, pleased by Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s visit, she invited her into the cottage, dusted a chair, and poured forth an account of all that the doctor had said about Nat, and the chances of his recovery. â\\x80\\x98Would you like to see him, Miss? Miss Follaton is up with him ; but that makes no difference.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Miss Follaton?â\\x80\\x99 asked Ursule, in surprise. â\\x80\\x98Is it Miss Elsie ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, no ; the eldestâ\\x80\\x94Miss Anne. I canâ\\x80\\x99t tell you what she has done for him ; she comes over all weathersâ\\x80\\x94nothing seems a troubleâ\\x80\\x94everything weâ\\x80\\x99ve wanted sheâ\\x80\\x99s helped us to ; and as for Nat, he thinks all the world of her. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s a real good young lady ; I donâ\\x80\\x99t know whatever the place would do without her.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule listened in amazement. This was the shy, awkward Anne, whom she had allowed herself to despise ! â\\x80\\x98It isnâ\\x80\\x99t one here and there, you see,â\\x80\\x99 pursued Mrs. Webber, warming with the recital, â\\x80\\x98 but wherever thereâ\\x80\\x99s trouble you â\\x80\\x9911 find Miss Anne. When that poor old cross Mrs. Harvey scalded herself, and the neighbours would hardly go near her, she went on at them so ; Miss Villars or Miss Anne was there every day, but Miss Anne the most ; and Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure theyâ\\x80\\x99ve told me how she used to scold and rate, till â\\x80\\x99t was a wonder they had the patience to keep on going. Will you go up and see Nat, Miss ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I should not like to disturb Miss Follaton,â\\x80\\x99 faltered Ursule. â\\x80\\x98 Sheâ\\x80\\x99s reading,â\\x80\\x99 announced Mrs. Webber, opening a door at the foot of the steps to listen. â\\x80\\x98 Here, Miss, if you just go quietly up four or five steps, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t interrupt them ; and I should like you to see how comfortable Nat looks.â\\x80\\x99 Seeing there w r as no escape, she stole gently up the stairs andCROSS PURPOSES. 399 looked in. Anne had her back to the door, and was reading in a soft voice the psalms for the dayâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Like as a father pitieth his own children, even so is the Lord merciful unto them that fear Him.â\\x80\\x99 The boyâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were closed, or he must have seen Ursule : she turned and went hastily down again, feeling as if her pre 172 sence there were an intrusion. â\\x80\\x98 How good she must be ! â\\x80\\x99 she said, warmly, her eyes filling with tears. â\\x80\\x98 Yes ; sheâ\\x80\\x99s a good young lady : itâ\\x80\\x99s a pity there isnâ\\x80\\x99t more like her,â\\x80\\x99 said the woman. Ursule left a promise that Bessie should come up and see her brother that evening, and went away from the cottage and down the long lane, thinking, as she went, of Anne Follaton and her unobtrusive work. Always quick in impulse, she blamed herself for her judgment of one whom now she was ready to exalt into a heroine. The little incident added another warning against a too ready habitâ\\x80\\x94perhaps a national habit exaggerated â\\x80\\x94to be content with no more than a surface-view of people and things. â\\x80\\x98 I have laughed at her with Madame,â\\x80\\x99 thought she, penitently, â\\x80\\x98 called her awkward, disagreeable, proud ; and all this time she has been going about doing the work of a saint ! â\\x80\\x99 She looked round once or twice, hoping that Anne might overtake her, and no longer afraid of her brusque manner, for which she made a hundred excuses on the spot. But no Anne appeared. To tell the truth, she heard from Mrs. Webber of Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s visit, and the horror of a walk tÃ¨te Ã\\xa0 t\\'cte with her was so strong, that she went home by another lane, which took her a mile out of her way, but secured soli 172 tude. â\\x80\\x98 Fancy having been obliged to walk back alone with Made-4oo ONE YEAR. moiselle Lafon ! â\\x80\\x99 she said to Elsie, when she reached home in a very weary condition. â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, hesitatingly. â\\x80\\x98Yet I donâ\\x80\\x99t know; I do begin to think she is nice.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah, you are clever, and I dare say you can get on with strange people,â\\x80\\x99 said Anne, humbly ; â\\x80\\x98 but then I never can.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule, reaching home, found Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny asleep, and, taking a book with her, went to sit, as she not infrequently did, in a corner of the green-house. She\\' thought that probably Mr. Blunt had returned to Defforton, and was surprised presently to see him stalking across the grass. â\\x80\\x98 Sarah told me that I should find you here,â\\x80\\x99 he said, coming in upon her with a bright eager face. â\\x80\\x98 I have been to the shore in search of you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Have you ? â\\x80\\x99 she replied, colouring a little. â\\x80\\x98 I did not go there to-day; I went through the lanes. I heard a great deal about your cousin, Miss Anne ; how good she is ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Who?â\\x80\\x94Anne?â\\x80\\x99 he said, indifferently. â\\x80\\x98Yes, I believe she is a good girl.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Very, very good ! I wish I were like her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Do you ? I donâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule felt puzzled and a little uneasy. She tried to keep up the ball of conversation ; but Mr. Blunt seemed absent, answered shortly, and the frequent pauses became uncomfortable. Once or twice she fancied that something must have displeased him ; at other times she felt, with a sense of alarm, that he must be going to break something to her, so much did his manner re 172 mind her of the day when he told her about his motherâ\\x80\\x99s will. Once the question was on her tongue, but, glancing into his face, she caught his eyes fixed so earnestly upon her own that she could only look quickly away. What did he mean by thatCROSS PURPOSES. 401 strange expression? What made her heart beat so violently, and the colour flush into her cheek ? She was half frightened, half angry, half happy, all without knowing why. She stood up at last, and said, with a valiant effort and trembling voice, â\\x80\\x98 I must go. Madame, I dare say, is ready for her chocolate.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No ; she is not awake, and does not want you. You may as well stay out a little longer ; for in ten minutes I must be off.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ten minutes ! â\\x80\\x99 thought Ursule ; â\\x80\\x98 surely I can endure it for that time.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I was going to speak to you about my aunt.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Now it is coming,â\\x80\\x99 she thought again. â\\x80\\x98I was sure there was something to be told me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She is, as you know, very old, very feeble, very suffering, and very exacting,â\\x80\\x99 he added, with a smile. â\\x80\\x98 I do not find her so now,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, simply, after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s consideration, perceiving that he paused for an answer. â\\x80\\x98 That is because your own kind heart will not suffer you to dwell upon it. Do you think that I have been quite blind all this time? that I am not aware of the trials you have had to endureâ\\x80\\x94the patience, the love, you have poured forth freely ? I can tell you now, although I tell you with shame, that once it was othenvise ; that I did not believeâ\\x80\\x94that, in short, I was a thick-headed fool ! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the long and short of the matter, Ursule.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No,â\\x80\\x99 she interrupted; â\\x80\\x98you only thought of me justly. You were right.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Was I ? â\\x80\\x99 he said, tenderly. â\\x80\\x98 I think not. I think this winter has taught me many things, and has set that mistake right, at all events. What would have become of my poor aunt without you? You have cheered her life; you have devoted 26402 ONE YEAR. your youth to a thankless nursing of one who had no real claim upon you, and have given up country, friends, all you cared for, to live in a place where, I am ashamed to say, you have met with neither kindness nor sympathy. You talk of Anne; what is Anneâ\\x80\\x99s life, compared to yours ? â\\x80\\x99 His voice was agitated, and Ursule could not answer; she felt tears rush into her eyesâ\\x80\\x94glad thankful tears, with a strange happiness at the bottom of them. For a minute or two there was perfect silence ; suddenly Clement said, â\\x80\\x98 Do you remember the old farm ? â\\x80\\x99 She gave him a quick look by way of reply. â\\x80\\x98 How I misjudged you then ! â\\x80\\x99 he said. There was nothing to be answered to this ; but presently she said, in a low voice, â\\x80\\x98You made him very happy; he often said so afterwards. Do you know, I was so wicked and selfish, that I used to feel jealous? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I remember you were very quiet whenever you vouchsafed to stay in the room,â\\x80\\x99 he said, with a smile. â\\x80\\x98 Last summer seems so long ago.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Poor child, you have had a good deal of winter since ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Not all winter,â\\x80\\x99 she said, quickly. â\\x80\\x98At first I thought it could be nothing else. After I lost Louis, the whole world seemed cold and bare ; and then England ! Oh, it all looked so sad, so gloomy,J â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But now ? â\\x80\\x99 he asked, with eagerness. â\\x80\\x98 Now,â\\x80\\x99 she said, gently, â\\x80\\x98it is growing into home.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Blunt looked well content, although he said nothing more. Indeed, he had not a moment to lose, as he discovered to his dismay by hearing St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s clock strike. He jumped up, wished Ursule a hurried good-bye, and was gone. But,CROSS PURPOSES. 4Â°3 hurried though it was, there was a something in that farewell which, without her being able to explain it to herself, distin 172 guished it from all other farewells. It left behind it a shy un 172 acknowledged happiness. She lingered in the garden, wondering at the beauty of the spring flowers, the colour of the sky ; and when she ventured to recall Clementâ\\x80\\x99s words at all, she fancied it was for the pleasure of reflecting that he, who was so wise and good, was pleased with her conduct towards Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny. It was a very sweet reflection, to judge by her face lit up by a tender glow of delight. Her quick movements were subdued and softened; she went slowly into the house, and on the threshold turned to throw her arms round Jock. â\\x80\\x98It is pleasant to have kindness, is it not, my friend?â\\x80\\x99 she whispered in his ear. * What would you like, in your turn ? I will bring you a big handful of biscuits which will make you jump for joy. Do not fear; I will never forget you.â\\x80\\x99 Jock had no fear. He wagged his tail confidingly, and with loving looks watched his mistress so long as she was in sight ; when she was gone, the tail slackened, the ears drooped, and he trotted sadly off to the back regions, where the sympathy he was likely to meet with would not be so appreciative or satisfactory. â\\x80\\x98 Is that you at last, Ursule?â\\x80\\x99 inquired Madame, as she heard the door open. â\\x80\\x98Yes, Madame, it is I. I have not awakened you, have I?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I never sleep at this hour,â\\x80\\x99 answered the old lady, indignantly. Then, changing her tone, she said gently, â\\x80\\x98 Come, and let me see you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Here I am, Madame,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, playfully, standing be 172 fore her with clasped hands, glowing cheeks, and a smile on her lips. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny scrutinised her closely. Ã\\x8dGâ\\x80\\x942404 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98You look very happy, child!â\\x80\\x99 she said at last, with some 172 thing of a sigh. â\\x80\\x98 Do I ! I think I am happy.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Why, then ? â\\x80\\x99 1 Why ? Who knows ? Why should I not be ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No one is happy without a reason.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, certainly. But I have reasons.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, to commence with, summer is coming.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Go on.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Eh bien, I do not know. The world looks smiling : it is not always so.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I believe you are growing pretty, Ursule,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, still watching her attentively. â\\x80\\x98 Am I ? â\\x80\\x99 she said, blushing. â\\x80\\x98 How glad I am ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Your skin is delicate, althoughitis brown; and if you could only manage always to show colour through it, it would be charming.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule laughed merrily; such compliments from Madame were very unusual. â\\x80\\x98Some one will soon be applying to me for your hand in marriage,â\\x80\\x99 continued Madame, gravely. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, no ! â\\x80\\x99 cried the girl, in a startled voice. â\\x80\\x98 Why not ? It is not good for you to live alone in the world. I should rejoice for it to be so, I assure you; for, although it is not convenable to talk to a young girl on such a subject, your position is different from other girls, and therefore I break through my rules.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Dear Madame,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, touched with what seemed to be unselfish thought for her, and kneeling down at her side as she spoke, â\\x80\\x98 do not speak of such a thing. Would you send me away from you ? â\\x80\\x99CROSS PURPOSES. 40s â\\x80\\x98Ursule,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, solemnly, â\\x80\\x98it is probable that my position will, before long, be changed ; that we may not continue to reside together in this dwelling, where, I am bound to say, you have behaved to me in a very proper and respectful man 172 ner. Believe me, I should not willingly quit you. No other inducement but the prospect of an establishment in my nephewâ\\x80\\x99s house would have led me to consider the propriety of taking such a step.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98But,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, springing up in wonderâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98but I do net understand ! You are going away; and to Monsieur Blunt? \\' â\\x80\\x98 He has requested me to live with him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Surely, Madame, you do not like his rooms. You said you could not move into lodgings. You are going away !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My nephew will no longer reside in apartments. I have not explained all to you ; and, indeed, you are to understand that no one but myself as yet is acquainted with his intentions. Very properly he has mentioned them to me, as his nearest relation, and therefore the first to be consulted on all matters of importance. He is about to make a change in his life ; he is goingâ\\x80\\x94pick up my handkerchief, child.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule ; but she did not move. She stood motion 172 less, with her eyes fixed upon Madameâ\\x80\\x99s grey face. â\\x80\\x98 It is as I knew,â\\x80\\x99 said the latter to herself. â\\x80\\x98 Well, what was I saying ? Oh, about Clement. He is going to marry ; he has just informed me of it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You do not ask me to whom,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, after a minuteâ\\x80\\x99s pause. â\\x80\\x98 Perhaps he would rather I did not know,â\\x80\\x99 answered Ursule, in a low voice. â\\x80\\x98 Perhaps,â\\x80\\x99 returned Madame, her conscience, to tell the4o6 ONE YEAR. truth, a little smiting her. â\\x80\\x98 Nevertheless, I am the best judge of what should be known and what kept secret. He intends to marry his cousin Joyce.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule did not make any comment, or change her position. She still faced Madame steadily ; and the latter, who, in spite oi her liking for the girl, loved still better the consciousness of her own penetration, became almost impatient for a sign to confirm it. â\\x80\\x98 Well,â\\x80\\x99 she said, quickly, â\\x80\\x98 do you mean to say that you are not astonished ? I perceived it long ago ; but I did not sup 172 pose you had also guessed it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I guessed nothing,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, faintly. â\\x80\\x98You like Joyce ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, yes, indeed; I hope she will be very happy,â\\x80\\x99 said the poor child, speaking with an effort. And then the colour rushed into her face. Why, oh, why had he said what he had said in the green-house ? Why had he wished her that farewell ? Surely it was not only mockery of her, it was treachery to Joyce. A bitter feeling of shame came over her as she stood there, un 172 able, as it seemed, to move, and with Madame covertly watch 172 ing her to make sure how the matter lay. Madame was really sorry, really interested : perhaps, of late years, in her desolate life, she had never felt so comparatively unselfish an interest in any one. Ursule had grown by degrees into her heart ; and, narrow though the chamber was, under her influence it, little by little, enlarged itself. * Go down-stairs, child ; go out again, if you will,â\\x80\\x99 she said, kindly. â\\x80\\x98You look pale. I do not want anything; and this is Monsieur le Chanoineâ\\x80\\x99s afternoon.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule needed no second bidding ; she went away down-stairs, glad to escape, glad to get out of the house. Not into theCROSS PURPOSES. 407 gardenâ\\x80\\x94there she could not go,â\\x80\\x94but to her old refuge, the sea, that never-broken link between herself and her country. At the door, Jock, whose keen intelligence was never baffled, met her; and Ursule turned round, went deliberately up thepassage- stairs again, to the biscuit-tin, and brought him out the handful she had promised. â\\x80\\x98 There, my friend,â\\x80\\x99 she said, quietly, â\\x80\\x98 you shall not be de 172 ceived.â\\x80\\x99 She walked quickly across the meadows, scarcely seeing the path for the hot tears in her eyes. â\\x80\\x98 Madame is going to live with them, and I shall be left.â\\x80\\x99 For some time that was the only sentence that presented itself; by-and-bye, she went on passionately, â\\x80\\x98 If I could only have respected him, it would not be so bad. I could be glad and thankful that he should be happy. But he had no right to speak as he spoke : it was wicked to Joyce, poor Joyce ! Oh, he ought not to have done so : it was not good of him. And I have no oneâ\\x80\\x94no one to help me. I am only a poor girl, not knowing what to do, and always doing wrong. I ought to have come away at once, and not listened. What a good, true wife she will make him ! Madame saw it long ago, she says ; so that, had I but thought of it, I should have known it, too. They will marry, and Madame will live with them. As for me, who cares? At all events, then, I may go away from this black, terrible England, back to my own people. I never wish to see him again : how dare he speak so ! Oh, you great, beautiful sea, will you go and tell them that Iâ\\x80\\x94poor little Ursule Lafonâ\\x80\\x94am coming soon? Do not let them forget me ; ask them to take me back again.â\\x80\\x99 She stretched out her arms to the grey waves, one after another coming on, and breaking into ranks of snowy foam. The sky was softly clouded ; here and there great sea-birds swoopedONE YEAR. into the water, and rose again, with shrill cries, to catch the light upon their white wings. Nothing calms human emotion like the seaâ\\x80\\x94so grand that it dwarfs the troubles which encom 172 pass us ; so beautiful, that it softens our hearts : it has kept unchanged the impress of its great Makerâ\\x80\\x99s hand ; it continues the same as when, at the first creation, the waters above the firmament were separated from the waters below the firmament, and it was very good. It is a boundary which does not cramp usâ\\x80\\x94ever varying, yet fixed by an eternal decree. It did now to Ursule as it has done to thousands of poor troubled men and women in all agesâ\\x80\\x94as all Godâ\\x80\\x99s works are intended to doâ\\x80\\x94lifted her thoughts to a higher level. Jock, with his wise, wistful eyes, could not fathom the workings of his young mistressâ\\x80\\x99s mind. She did not herself know what influence it was that calmed her ; but, standing there, the bitterness went out of her heart, and left herâ\\x80\\x94distressed and uneasy, it is true, that the man to whom she had always looked up with a certain pride in his goodness and honour should have played a double part, but no longer feeling a sort of fierce rage that her own heart had been entrapped. â\\x80\\x98 How could I have permitted myself to dream such foolish dreams ?â\\x80\\x99 she asked herself, sadly. â\\x80\\x98 It must have been that I had no time to reflect, or I should have known how it must end. Oh, I pray, I pray they may be happy ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, clasping her hands, and saying the words aloud. â\\x80\\x98 And, for me, I will go back to the old house, to Madame San 172 son. I will leave all that I have here behind me for themâ\\x80\\x94all but you, Jock ; and you and I will not part.â\\x80\\x99 Long and earnestly Ursule looked out over the great waters ; and, as she looked, she thought that it might be she was called upon to live a grey life, unbrightened by much sunshine, un 172 cheered by such rich colours as, at times, she had watched tint-CROSS PURPOSES. 409 ing the whole face of sky and sea with their glorious hues. â\\x80\\x98 Like the sea now,â\\x80\\x99 she pondered ; â\\x80\\x98 but yet the greyness has its own quiet loveliness, and perhaps the sunset will be the most beautiful hour of the day. Ah, my Louis, what a sunset came to you ! The day cannot be long ; and, while it lasts, I will not shut out the blessed sunshine, but I will try with all my might to look to the sunset at the end.â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER XXIII.

It is very un- of you and mamma to be able to do without or so long a time. If you donâ\\x80\\x99t take care, I y not returning home at all. Really, papa, I want you dreadfully. It seems to me that certain good inten 172 tions have plunged me into a regular sea of mistakes, and I am sure I cannot give you any idea of them in a letter. I only know that I donâ\\x80\\x99t see my way out of them ; and the worst is that other people are affected by them. I suppose that always is the worst of oneâ\\x80\\x99s mistakes. I am thinking of applying to Uncle Lawrenceâ\\x80\\x94who, you know, is never so happy as when HEN kind * *THE WIND AND THE SUN he is routing out the contents of some wonderful old book which no one has looked into for the last hundred yearsâ\\x80\\x94to find out for me whether, in the annals of astrology, there is any star which bestows upon those unfortunate enough to come under its influence the inclination to be for ever setting the world to rights. I have a theory that the old woman who went up on a broomstick was afflicted with this mania. Her desire to sweep cobwebs from the sky was no more than a development of the feelingâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t you see ? But then I reflect that, if one carries on the idea, it is very difficult to know where to stop ; because what is one to say about Don Quixote and all the grand old champions of romance ? And that is exactly the difficulty I get into every day. There are so many things which, it seems to me, a little trouble would im 172 prove ; but nobody appears to think of taking the trouble, and at last I make a remark which offends somebody, or hurts some 172 body, or afflicts somebody : it is quite horrid to think how often I do one or the other. â\\x80\\x98 I told you in one of my letters that I did not like Bella at all. Anne and Elsie are dear, good, conscientious girls ; but Bella I think very badly of. She is not true nor trustworthy ; she is for ever putting a colouring upon words or things which does not really belong to them ; and yet the tiresome part of the matter is, that dear, kind Miss Villars always believes in her, and spoils her thoroughly. Well, several weeks ago there was a regular fuss : it was found out that she had repeated something she had overheard about Ursule Lafonâ\\x80\\x99s father to Mrs. Chambers, and exaggerated it so much that Mrs. Chambers would have no more to say to Ursule until, at a dinner-party here, the right story came out. Of course, we were all very indignantâ\\x80\\x94all except Miss Villars, and she actually412 ONE YEAR. would not believe it until she had gone to Mrs. Chambersâ\\x80\\x99s and found it out beyond doubt ; and ever since that time, instead of giving Bella a punishment she would remember, she has done nothing but look sorrowfully at her, and has made no dif 172 ference whatever in her treatment. You see, if Bella were a different sort of girl, she might feel her auntâ\\x80\\x99s kindness, but she does not ; she only takes it sulkily, as if it were a right. I could not help letting her see what I thought ; but I acknowledge it has done no good : she has scarcely spoken to me since, and I only affronted her. â\\x80\\x98 Then there is Anne. She is so good, and so stupid. Stupid, I mean, about being shy and always keeping in the background, instead of taking her proper place. I really believe that some people think her half an idiot, just owing to her manner ; but it never seems to strike her own family that she might be different. She lets herself go about such an object. Her hair is always untidy, and her hat crooked, and her gowns more wonderfully ugly than I can tell you ; and it does provoke one to see her making the worst of herself, when one knows how excellent she is in all really important things. But when I tell her so, and try to rub up her dress, and make her think about her appearance, she only gets scared. I believe she is really growing afraid of me, and I am sure I wish I never said anything to her; but, somehow or other, when I see her such an object, I canâ\\x80\\x99t keep my tongue still ; and if I make a joke of it, she does not under 172 stand, and it frightens her the more. â\\x80\\x98 And as to St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s, I get into hot water whenever I go there, because I canâ\\x80\\x99t help seeing such hundreds of things that want to be altered. Really it is too much, Sunday after Sun 172 day, to sit in great square pews, and have whitewashed gurgoyles staring down upon one. It might be so beautiful ; and actuallyTHE WIND AND THE SUN. 413 more than one person has spoken to Uncle Lawrence and offered money towards the restoration, and he has not the energy to undertake it. Perhaps that canâ\\x80\\x99t be helped ; but the provoking part of the business is that not one of the household but thinks it all quite perfect and as it should be, only just because it happens to be their St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s. There is no getting their ideas out of the Elmwood groove. Such odd services as there were in Lent ! such hymns and, oh, such decorations at Easter ! I did work them up to a slight improvement about some points ; but there seemed to be no ideas beyond box and green things twisted together ; and the only special hymns they use are those at the end of the Prayer-Book. â\\x80\\x98 But then, papa, remarking all these things only makes me uncomfortable, and spoils the service ; and yet I canâ\\x80\\x99t help re 172 marking them. Anne and Elsie and Miss Villars go to church, and heartily enter into the service, while I am seeing this and that, and wishing it were otherwise, and not spending my time half as profitably as they. And now, in looking back at what I have written, it seems very conceited. I wonder whether you will not shake your head over it, and think of little Harry Foster ? I think of him every day. I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to excuse myself. I cannot tell whether I am conceited or not ; but I know I find it dreadfully hard not to want to have things done, and not to be impatient. 1 You must not believe this letter, if it grumbles ; for I am very happy here, and they are as kind as possible. Elsie, with all her oddities, is delightful, altogether honest and true-hearted. Only, you know, I have been away from you a long, long time, and I do want to get home. Besides, it is Easter week, and you promised to fetch me after Easter. My dear love to mamma, and tell her I have a lovely new flower waiting for meAIS ONE YEAR. to take to London. Please to write and say you are coming for Your own affectionate Daughter, â\\x80\\x98Joyce Clayton. â\\x80\\x98 P.S.â\\x80\\x94They are building a new dissenting chapel in the village. We donâ\\x80\\x99t think it will be supported; but meanwhile it is a â\\x80\\x9c stony griefâ\\x80\\x9d for our eyes.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton laid down the letter with a smile and a sigh, then took it up and read it again, with the graver feeling pre 172 dominating. It was very unusual for Joyce to discuss her own feelings ; and he fancied that a tone of depression ran through the letter, also unlike his bright, brave-spirited little daughter. His meditations took shape in the following note : â\\x80\\x98My dear Child, â\\x80\\x98 Make up your mind to leave Elmwood on Saturday week. I hope to get down on Monday or Tuesday, when, so far, there appears to be a convenient blank in the weekâ\\x80\\x99s work. Then we will talk over what you have written. Now I will only say, remember, when you feel left to yourself and puzzled, that you have always within your reach better help than my best advice. â\\x80\\x98Your affectionate Father, â\\x80\\x98Reginald Clayton.â\\x80\\x99 Joyce was not altogether mistaken in her idea of the effect she produced upon her two cousins. Anne was, in truth, afraid of her, in the midst of all her admiration. Joyce was eager and quick, and decided matters before Anne had half pondered them to her own satisfaction ; and then the younger girl felt, with a sinking of the heart, her inferiority of judgment andTHE WIND AND THE SUN 415 slowness. And, somehow or other, Joyce, in her attempts toâ\\x80\\x94 as she termed itâ\\x80\\x94brush up Anne, contrived, quite unintention 172 ally, to make her more conscious of her own defects ; so that, actually, her presence was acting as a continual discouragement. Anne, always anxious and dissatisfied with herself, prized beyond their worth her cousinâ\\x80\\x99s powers. Her readiness of wit, her quick comprehension, her capability for accomplishing what 172 ever she undertookâ\\x80\\x94all these, and many other forms of clever 172 ness, seemed to poor Anne wonderful possessions indeed, before which everything of her own sank deeper and deeper into insignificance. She had, moreover, always a difficulty in under 172 standing a joke, and banter was a weapon against which she was utterly unable to defend herself. Consequently, as Joyce, on the contrary, loved nothing better than a little good-humoured quizzing, Anne passed moments of torment, at times actually painful, and scarcely to be understood, except by those whose temperament resembles hers. No one, but the sufferer, knows how a shaft of ridiculeâ\\x80\\x94sent, very likely, not from malice, but thoughtlessnessâ\\x80\\x94can wound one who lacks the power of light 172 hearted repartee. And Anne, with all her affection for her cousin, grew more silent, and awkward, and constrained every day. With Bella there was more serious mischief. Throughout Lentâ\\x80\\x94throughout the Great Week of sadness and stillnessâ\\x80\\x94 throughout the rejoicings of Easter, Bella had held on her way, given no signs of sorrow, uttered no word of repentance. It seemed as if Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s words had simply hardened her, and brought out all the obstinacy of her disposition. She kept away from her sisters with a sullen reserve, which went to Anneâ\\x80\\x99s heart ; she was more naughty and trying to little Miss Smith than she had been ever before. The governess actually dreaded to say what must be done, so certain was she to meet4i6 ONE YEAR. with gloomy, grudging obedience at the best. To Joyce she never spoke. And yet, in spite of all, Miss Villars was right in her unswerv 172 ing belief that Bella was naughty because she was unhappy. Throughout those long weeks, her silent misery had been very great. She knew what days those were that went by, one by one, calling to her, with its message of loving sorrowâ\\x80\\x94one by one passing for ever, with its opportunities of grace not to be recalled. When she awoke in the morning, she longed for night to come; yet the half-hour before she slept was the worst of all. She dreaded the services, because every word seemed to be meant for her, and over everything there hung the sense of withheld blessings. She was glad, on Easter Day, that she had not yet been confirmed, and that she could naturally come away with Rose. Even her father perceived that some 172 thing was not right with her, and as-â\\x80\\x94although slow to see in the first placeâ\\x80\\x94he had, every now and then, a marvellous power of drawing out right conclusions, Bella felt a sharp pang shoot through her at his remark. That he should know her fault was her greatest dread. She was very fond and very proud of her father. A word of praise from him she really valued ; and when once or twice he had been angry, she had never forgotten his rebuke. It would have been far better for her had Miss Villars told him what all the others, except Rose, knew. She might, without fear, have left the love between father and childâ\\x80\\x94the reverence on her side and the tenderness on hisâ\\x80\\x94to work the good it assuredly must have worked ; but a mistaken desire to shield her darling, a yielding to what she felt to be Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s mute entreaty, induced her to remain silent. Perhaps, all the time she hoped that each day would see the barrier broken down which the girl had built up between herself and them, hoped forTHE WIND AND THE SUN 41? a frank confession, and would not give up the hope ; although, as I have said, weeks went by, and still no sign of repentance came. No punishment had been inflicted, because Miss Villars held, perhaps rightly, that her own shame would be the severest punishment; nevertheless, she suffered at least as much as Bella, when she found all her yearning kindness so baffled that it produced no result but the same apparent hardening against her. She reproached herself unsparingly for not having watched Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s character more closely, so as to have detected the germs of deceit ; and it was, probably, natural and only to be expected that the whole business increased the nervous, almost morbid anxiety with which she regarded the four sisters. And what would Bella not have given to acknowledge her fault ! Many and many a time, when she caught Miss Villarsâ\\x80\\x99s anxious eyes upon her, the tears rushed into her own, and she was forced to turn away her head to conceal them. She had grown up among too good influences to be able to blind herself to her fault, and, indeed, she knew better than they all that it was neither one, nor two, nor three sins of that sort which she had need to remember, but numberless such.â\\x80\\x94many which had drawn a word of indignation from Elsie, others so small as to be unknown to all but herself and God. She was wretched, and she longed to say so; but Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s words had hardened her against all. Nay, again and again, when her auntâ\\x80\\x99s silent sorrow touched her almost beyond en 172 durance, she had steeled herself into obstinacy by thinking of her cousin. The want of generosity, the almost treachery, were just the very faults for which Joyce could make the least allow 172 ance. Bella believed that she despised her, and perhaps, it was too true. But contempt is, at any time, only likely to arouse angry pride ; and pride having stubborness for its favourite com- 27ONE YEAR. panion, *c is easy to understand how, by yielding to it, she was, day by day, fastening its chains more closely around herself, and, in bitterness of feeling against her cousin, was losing the precious hours of repentance. Altogether, from one cause and another, a cloud seemed to rest over the place. Joyce was restless, and a little impatient of everybody, although keeping a sharp, unsparing guard over herself as well. She longed for her father to come, longed to go home ; once there, there was little fear of her active habits permitting her to indulge in foolish discontent : but at Elmwood she had no fixed duties, and used to grow indignant when she found herself dreaming. Miss Villarsâ\\x80\\x99s unhappiness revolved round Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s, and, as no sign of softening appeared, she grew more and more sad. Anne was depressed. Mr. Follaton spent a good deal of time at Defforton, buried in the recesses of the Chapter library. Elsie began to wonder what had come over her world. At the Cottage, Ursule seemed only to have grown very quiet. She went softly up and down the stairs ; she did not chatter away to Jock; she was more gentle than ever to Madame, and did her very utmost to amuse her ; only, some 172 times in the midst of talking she would fall into a long reverie, from which she did not soon arouse herself. Madame, glancing up at her, would comprehend, and remain silent. Never before had she been so interestedâ\\x80\\x94never taken so much thought for, absolutely restrained herself on account of, any personâ\\x80\\x94as now for Ursule. The girlâ\\x80\\x99s patient self-denial had brought forth its fruit. As to Clement, he seemed to be the most uneasy of all. When Easter came, it brought him to the Cottage, where Ursule resolutely kept out of his way, and, if she was forced into corn tact, was cold and impassive as he had never before seenTHE WIND AND THE SUN 419 her. When she was not with Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny, she shut herself into her own room, not even venturing upon a walk to the sea, lest she should by chance encounter him on the road. Madame wondered whether any great step had been taken, and would have asked him without delay, but that she stood somewhat in awe of her nephew, and something in his face warned her off the subject. It was not until be was bidding her good-bye that she kept his hand in hers, and said, â\\x80\\x98Well, is there nothing for me to hear?â\\x80\\x99 * Nothing,â\\x80\\x99 he said, withdrawing his hand, and his face cloud- ing as he spoke. â\\x80\\x98 But that is strange ! â\\x80\\x99 * Not more strange, perhaps, than that I should have been fool enough to think of it. You and I were both mistaken, I suppose.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am not often mistaken,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, with dignity. â\\x80\\x98 I affirm my opinion to have been right.â\\x80\\x99 Clement shook his head despondingly. â\\x80\\x98 Not in this case.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 In this case.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No; she cares nothing.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then give her up,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, promptly, with a little sigh at the thought of the house in Defforton where she had pictured herselfâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 give her up, and choose some one else. Whom shall we find ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No one,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Blunt, with a sad smile. â\\x80\\x98If it is not she, it shall be no one else. No ; I shall try my fate â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98It must be soon,â\\x80\\x99 interrupted Madame, thinking that Joyce would shortly be gone. â\\x80\\x98Yes; it shall be quickly, as you say. There is no good in hanging about in uncertainty. I would a hundred times 27â\\x80\\x942420 ONE YEAR. rather know the worst at once. It shall be when I come, next week.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Very well,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, sighing. â\\x80\\x98And you wish me to live with you ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I should think so ! â\\x80\\x99 he replied, brightening up. Madame fell into a meditation when her nephew had departed. She thought of the little household in Defforton, Clement attentive and thoughtful, Joyce bright, cheery, and the best of managers, her servants well-ordered, her cuisine attractiveâ\\x80\\x94a pleasant window, perhaps, where she could lie and watch the gaieties. For she had always been accustomed, since her married life, to live in a town; she loved society, and detested the country ; and she believed that there would be in the sober, dull English county town as much enlivenment and stir as in her own bright, talkative Dieppe. It was very tempting. But then before her there rose up a little head of brown, wavy hair, eyes whose old laughter had grown wistful, a mouth sweet and pa 172 tient, as if resolved to keep its sadness out of sight. Madame put up her hand to push the vision away, but still it haunted her. â\\x80\\x98 She could not live here by herself,â\\x80\\x99 she said, impatiently ; â\\x80\\x98 she will be very desolate. How much trouble these children give one ! If I remain in this place, there will be no distraction ; and at my age one requires it, though Heaven knows I am not unreasonable. But if I go away, Ursule must go tooâ\\x80\\x94back to those eternal Sansons. Well, and why not?â\\x80\\x99 Madame asked herself the question almost fiercely; and, before she had time to answer it, Ursule came in, having heard the door shut behind Mr. Blunt. She asked some question cheerfully ; but Madame was not wanting in penetrationâ\\x80\\x94she saw that her cheeks were colourless, that she looked thin and weary.THE WIND AND THE SUN 421 â\\x80\\x98 Why do you not go out ? â\\x80\\x99 she said, almost snappishly. â\\x80\\x98But why?â\\x80\\x99 asked Ursule, looking up in surprise. â\\x80\\x98You like me to be with you at this hour of the morning.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 That is a folly,â\\x80\\x99 answered Madame in the same tone. â\\x80\\x98 You suppose that you are necessary to me, whereas you ought to know that I can do very well without you. I shall not be much longer with you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 So I supposed,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule in a low voice. â\\x80\\x98 My nephew has been speaking to me again.â\\x80\\x99 Ursule did not reply, but she grew a little paler. â\\x80\\x98 Nothing is yet settled ; it will be, however, when he comes next week. Child, you cannot live here alone.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Do you think I would ! â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, lifting her head, and speaking rapidly. â\\x80\\x98 Ah, no, no ; when you leave me, I shall go back to France.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But the Cottage ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The Cottage ?â\\x80\\x94he may have it ; you may have it, if you will ! What do I care ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed impetuously, tears rush 172 ing into her eyes. â\\x80\\x98 And you will be alone.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, I shall be alone ; but God will not let me be quite desolate.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You are a brave girl,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, looking at her admir 172 ingly. â\\x80\\x98 Am I ? â\\x80\\x99 Ursule smiled a little bitterly, thinking that, after all, it was well for her if she was brave. â\\x80\\x98 Still, you might say that you are sorry to go away from me. It is not likely you will ever see me again.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah ! â\\x80\\x99 said the girl, throwing her arms round Madameâ\\x80\\x99s neck, and sobbing, â\\x80\\x98 do you not know that I am sorry ? I had thought you had grown to love meâ\\x80\\x94that we should always live together.422 ONE YEAR. All this has come upon me suddenly, until I scarcely feel like myself ; but you do not need me to tell you I am sorry ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then, petite,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Madame, suddenly, with tears run 172 ning down her withered cheeks, â\\x80\\x98 do not go away ! After all, it would hurt my back terribly to make this other journey : you and I will live on together, and my nephew and his wife may do as they please for themselves. Do you hear me ? Are you content ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Ursule, smiling brightly through her tears; â\\x80\\x98I am content that you are not pleased to send me away from you. But I must not be selfish ; for you will be more happy with Mr. Blunt, whom you love so dearly.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Bah ! He is but a man ! â\\x80\\x99 said Madame, with contempt ; â\\x80\\x98 besides which, he will be out all day, and it is not certain that she will understand me. I can be tranquil here, if only, child, you will persuade that terrible Sarah to vary her potatoes a little, and, if she will not permit me other vegetables, at all events to send them up not eternally en robe de chambre.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I will dress the potatoes myself,â\\x80\\x99 cried Ursule, kissing her; and\\'in her heart there broke out a little triumphant glow of delight that, at last, again there was some one to love her and cling to her. She had felt desolate and deserted, poor child, during the past days, and not even the wish to return to France could balance the feeling. She went away, down-stairs, com 172 forted ; and in the hall she met Elsie, coming to see her, for the first time, alone and unsupported, and bringing a pretty bunch of sweet flowers for an offering. Ursule did not know that the event had been brought to pass by a little wile of Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s ; but she was touched and pleased, and the ice, which had for some time past been melting, thawed rapidly when the two girls were left to themselves ; and Elsie found, to her surprise, that UrsuleTHE WIND AND THE SUN. was actually a being possessing very much the same tastes and likings as herself, and no longer divided by the barrier of an unfamiliar language. They chatted, and Ursule walked back with her visitor ; and when they parted at the gate, it was with an engagement to meet again, and every promise of a budding friendship.CHAPTER XXIV. WHAT JOYCE SAID. Natures whose roots strike deep Clear their own way, and win to light in growing. The Lost Taies of Miletus. pPRIL converted the Elmwood lanes into absolute green bowers, in which the birds sang all day long, cuckoo and all, and ferns unfolded themselves out of little brown, furry sheaths, and snowy hawthorn peeped out before its time, and cows waded through deep grass pastures. All along the hedges, tiny leaflets, vivid and beautiful, ran over the red soil and covered it up ; exquisite trails of young ivy fes 172 tooned themselves gracefully over the recessesâ\\x80\\x94the caves, as Rose called them, where she expected, every day that she peeped into them, to find a little champion fairy, exquisitely capari 172 soned, and ready to go forth and tilt with all adverse parties in the world. She met with wonderful insects instead, who scuttled away as fast as they could into the shady depths of their homes, and set her wondering over their family history. And through the young flickering leaves broad streaks of sun 172 light came down, and lit up the shady lanes and the scarletWHAT JOYCE SAID. 425 fairy cups that nestled in the moss ; and, in such a spring as this, April became the most enchanting time of all the year. Such a large party met Mr. Clayton at the station, that he grew fairly bewildered over his nieces, and required Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s assistance to separate Miss Smith from the party, and to identify the tall, lithe Elsie as belonging to him at all. Bella was the only absent one : she had pleaded a headache, which her heavy eyes showed was no fabrication, and shut herself into her room, desiring that she might not be disturbed. But Mr. Follaton, Miss Villars, Miss Smith, and the four girls were sufficient to form a sort of triumphal procession, with which to escort Mr. Clayton to the Rectory; and as to Joyce, she was thoroughly happy. The very sight of her father seemed to drive away the clouds which had of late been gathering ; she felt as if, now things would take right proportions, and go more smoothly. Perhaps, until to-day, she never knew how much she had de 172 pended upon him, even in what seemed the more than usually independent life of her home. She watched him proudly, thinking he looked very tall and handsome, and noticing Mr. Follatonâ\\x80\\x99s amusement at the bright, humorous touches which lightened the whole conversation. She was unusually silent her 172 self, content with the one clasp ; the quick, fond look that greeted her just giving the refreshment she wanted, and making her heart cry out, â\\x80\\x98 There is no one like papa ! â\\x80\\x99 Arrived at the house, Mr. Claytonâ\\x80\\x99s first inquiry was for Bella ; but she did not make her appearance until dinner-time, and then came down looking pale and spiritless as usual, and sheltering herself behind her sisters. Joyce was a little scandalised that her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s manner was the same with her as with Anne and Elsie : nay, she even thought that she caught his eye fixed426 ONE YEAR. upon her with a look of pity, such as the unsparing young judge could not understand. Papa does not know her,â\\x80\\x99 she said to herself. In all other respects the evening was very satisfactory. She gave herself up to the delight of listening to the dear, familiar voice, and watching the bright cordiality overcoming by degrees his niecesâ\\x80\\x99 shyness. Mr. Clayton was not so deeply read as his brother-in-law, for his opportunities of study had been fewer, and he had never experienced the temptation of retiring from an active life. But his information was more varied, his manner of imparting it more pleasant ; and through it all there flashed out the almost boyish light-heartedness that rarely deserted him, and gave an indescribable charm to his words. Argument he slipped out of wherever a loophole presented itself, for he could not cope with Mr. Follaton in his favourite warfare. His mind was too sympathetic, and, in seeing both sides of the question by means of a vivid imagination, it followed that it was impossible for him to concentrate his weapons of offence or attack. To be a good arguer, you must not allow your fancy to be discursive. But Joyce, who knew his face perfectly, observed now and then the twinkle of amusement in his eye at some of the strong Elmwood prejudices. To live in London was to them a lot too terrible to be calmly contemplated ; and Mr. Clayton, who was very far from considering himself victimised by that necessity, was somewhat astonished to find what a grateful sense of relief he was expected to feel at his release even for a short time from its miseries. â\\x80\\x98 Dreadful ! â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, dreadful ! â\\x80\\x99 echoed Anne. â\\x80\\x98Plenty to see and hear, at all events,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Clayton, laughing.WHAT JOYCE SAID. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Uncle Regie, but I hate sight-seeing.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But you liked the diver when you were a little girl,â\\x80\\x99 put in conscientious Anne, â\\x80\\x98 and the Zoological Gardens.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes, when I was little â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Only now you have grown beyond London ; is that it, Elsie ? â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton asked good-humouredly. â\\x80\\x98 I had rather be at home,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, stoutly. â\\x80\\x98 Papa,â\\x80\\x99 interrupted Joyce, â\\x80\\x98were the Easter decorations good ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Very fair, my dear; James Bennett outdid himself. Did you make Joyce useful here, Anne?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She tried to show us how to do some things that would have been beautiful,â\\x80\\x99 said Anne, speaking with difficulty ; â\\x80\\x98 butâ\\x80\\x94but we did not much like to have a great deal that was new.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You preferred the old way of doing it?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, not quiteâ\\x80\\x94at least, I am not sure; but I should have tried to get used to it ; and I dare say Joyce was quite right- only, Uncle Regie, you see, there are so many old people who come to St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s, people who donâ\\x80\\x99t like to see things different from what they used to be ; and I donâ\\x80\\x99t think they would be offended, because they are fond of papa, but they would have been distressed and worried.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98But, papa,â\\x80\\x99 interrupted Joyce, eagerly, â\\x80\\x98I tell Anne that if she waits until everybody is pleased she will wait for ever.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Anne, looking as she always did on these occasions, unprepared to argue with her cousin, but not thoroughly con 172 vinced. â\\x80\\x98You are quite right, my dear,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Clayton, kindly; â\\x80\\x98and I am glad you have not allowed Joyce to ride rough-shod over your opinions. She has a touch of the persecuting spirit in her, you must know, and is inclined to give you the choice of her theories or the stake.â\\x80\\x99428 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 I did not mean â\\x80\\x99 began Anne, in great distress lest her uncleâ\\x80\\x99s words should have hurt his daughter ; but, looking up, she saw her smiling at him with such comfortable confidence, that she stopped suddenly, and began to wonder whether ridi 172 cule was such a formidable weapon after all. â\\x80\\x98 Elsie is among the old people,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce. â\\x80\\x98 I would let her off the decorations, if she would only consent to like something beyond Tate and Brady.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I think some of those hymns you showed me were pretty,â\\x80\\x99 said the cousin attacked ; * but the others seem a great deal more natural now that they have been used so long. Why should one alter ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I admit the force of Anneâ\\x80\\x99s objection as applied to a body,â\\x80\\x99 replied Mr. Clayton ; â\\x80\\x98 but, having got hold of individual You, Elsie, I should say that age is not always lovely, and that there are venerable abuses as well as venerable treasures. In the case of Tate and Brady, moreover, they have never so much as reached age at all. What do you think about it, Bella?â\\x80\\x99 Bella started, looked up, and coloured. She had listened to the talk while apparently buried in a bookâ\\x80\\x94listened with a bitter resentful feeling that she was shut out from the merry circle by an impassable barrier. She was sure that Joyce, who despised her so greatly, had made her father adopt the same impression ; and she hardened herself more and more, and kept gloomily out of the conversation. Miss Villars watched her tenderly, Mr. Clayton with a little wonder : this Bella, silent, reserved, and rather sullen, was very unlike the girl Clement described, bent upon pleasing and showing off; and Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s letter had made him think of her anxiously. When he asked her the sudden question, she would have answered that she didWHA T JO YCE SAW. 4 2 9 not know what he was talking about, but that her uncle did not give her time. â\\x80\\x98 I think I saw in your face,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98 that you are not so persuaded of the virtues of Tate and Brady as Elsie. What do you say ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Everything here is horrid ! â\\x80\\x99 was Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s impetuous reply, and then she buried herself again in her book; and Mr. Follaton came into the room, carrying a precious folio for Mr. Clayton to examine, and the girls had no more of their uncle for the evening. He could only say to Joyce, as he kissed her in the hall, â\\x80\\x98I am prepared for an early walk to-morrow, if you will come.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, indeed. Thank you, papa. Wait for me in the garden, please.â\\x80\\x99 She was waiting for him instead, looking so fresh and eager that he held her at armâ\\x80\\x99s length, and said, with a smile, â\\x80\\x98You are a more satisfactory daughter than you were last night, let me tell you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am quite right again, now that you are come ; or, at all events, I am going to be right. Papa, I have wanted you dreadfully, and so have other people in consequence. There are a great many mistakes to be undone.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton looked grave. â\\x80\\x98 My dear,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98 you will have to fight your way through those yourself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But you will show me how to do it ? â\\x80\\x99 He did not answer for a moment, when he said, â\\x80\\x98Joyce, I shall feel that I have made a more terrible mistake than any of yours, if I have not taught you where to look for guidance, and where to seek for help.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I do not remember it half enough,â\\x80\\x99 she said, humbly ; â\\x80\\x98 but,43Â° ONE YEAR. papa, I am trying not to rush so eagerly after my own will. What am I to do ? I am always wanting to alter things that donâ\\x80\\x99t seem right, and I get puzzled about it. If I was older ! Is it wrong to feel this desire ? â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton thought before he replied. â\\x80\\x98 I believe it is good, Joyce. I believe that God has given you your energetic active spirit to do the work He has specially prepared for you. You need not wish it changed, only kept in hand. Feel that it is by doing His will we best do His work ; feel that His will means patience, and gentleness, and kindly forbearance, and humility ; and set yourself to win them, and the blessing that comes with them.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The very things I fail in ! â\\x80\\x99 said she, sighing. 1 The very things. But, with these guards, you need not fear making so many mistakes as have lately troubled you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, then, papa, I suppose one ought to wish and try to improve matters, though not to fuss when others donâ\\x80\\x99t see them in the same light ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I think so, Joyce. Prejudices, even when they are only prejudices, should be respected. And, surely, already many circumstances must have taught you to distrust your own judg 172 ment, and to learn the value of forbearance.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What do you think about Bella ? â\\x80\\x99 was the abrupt answer. â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to think, except that she is entirely different from anything I expected to see.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes, she is quite altered. Will you talk to her ? â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton could not help smiling, in spite of his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s earnestness. â\\x80\\x98My dear Joyce, I did not come down in order to act as Mentor to all the family. And if you want to hear my conclusions on the subject of Bella, I believe her to be very unhappy, and more likely to be affected for good by her auntâ\\x80\\x99sWHAT JOYCE SAID. 431 lovingness than by any other influence. Look at the beautiful glow on that field ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I wonder â\\x80\\x99began Joyce, ponderingly; she finished her sentence with saying in a doubtful tone, â\\x80\\x98 I cannot conceive dear, kind, soft-hearted Miss Villars having an influence with anybody.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98We shall see,â\\x80\\x99 said her father : â\\x80\\x98 meanwhile, you might study the fable of the sun and the wind.â\\x80\\x99 After this, their walk became somewhat silent ; she happily content in the perfect confidence which seemed more delight 172 ful than ever, after losing it for so many weeks; he thinking over many things, one being at last betrayed by his question of how Joyce liked Ursule. â\\x80\\x98Very well, indeed, papa. And I think it is just as well,â\\x80\\x99 she added, colouring a little under his eyes, but speaking with 172 out an instantâ\\x80\\x99s hesitation. â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Clayton, â\\x80\\x98 then I suppose it is as I guessed.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Did you guess it ? â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed his daughter in great wonder. â\\x80\\x98Yes, I am sure it is so; only I donâ\\x80\\x99t like to see that poor child looking so pale and wretched as she has done during the past week ; and I quite thought matters would have progressed by this time.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton walked on, relieved from the doubt which, since his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s words, had every now and then uncomfortably pre 172 sented itself, and a little amused at Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s patronage. She asked the next question : â\\x80\\x98 Elsie is very pretty, is she not ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, with the frankest, honestest expression I have seen for a long time.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And the more you know of her, the better you will like her. One of the provoking ways of Elmwood is Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s fashion of retiring into a shell before the outer world.â\\x80\\x99432 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98 I suppose, Joyce, that the perfection of manners consists in remaining natural at all times, neither shutting up nor forcing oneself forward; but, as the young ladies of the present day incline unmistakably towards the latter extreme, I have sym 172 pathy for Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s failing.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, papa, the world would be a very disagreeable place if we had to make all our acquaintances by means of such an up 172 hill progress,â\\x80\\x99 retorted Joyce, gaily. â\\x80\\x98 However, I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to make you find fault with my dear old Elsie ; I want you to carry her back with us, and see whether London would enlarge her ideas.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton did not at once answer. He had thought of the plan himself ; and then, since he had been at Elmwood, his mind had been a good deal occupied with Bella, and it had struck him again that it would be a good thing for the girl if she could be set down in a different place for a time, to make, as it were, a new start. He felt that he must wait a little, and observe more closelyâ\\x80\\x94for Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s own sakeâ\\x80\\x94before he proposed it; and, therefore, he did not answer definitely. â\\x80\\x98We will see about it,â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98 Perhaps Elsie would not like it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, I think she would venture under our wing. And you would like her ; she is very good and reverent-minded. There is the breakfast-bell ! â\\x80\\x99 After breakfast, Mr. Clayton was carried off to see the Cot 172 tage and its inhabitants. Ursule and he took to each other at once. She had not yet seen any one so genial and pleasant, who seemed to put all around him at ease, and to be unaffected by the little stiff barriers which chilled herself ; and he, for his part, was struck and a little puzzled by a quiet sadness which did not seem to belong either to her face or to the happy prospects at which Joyce had hinted. Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99sWHAT JOYCE SAID. 433 mysterious allusions also perplexed him ; she was dignified in her greeting, and half pathetic, half congratulatory, until poor Mr. Clayton was altogether at a loss to understand her mean 172 ing, and began to wonder whether her ailments were ending by affecting her head, and whether this was the reason of Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s depression. Yet Joyce laughed so heartily at the idea on their way home, that he could only fall back upon the conclusion that she must be a very eccentric woman, and hope that Clement would accelerate matters so as to give Ursule, before long, a more cheerful home. â\\x80\\x98 Poor child ! â\\x80\\x99 he said, compassionately, â\\x80\\x98 she looks very dismal.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t think she need be pitied, papa,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, quietly. â\\x80\\x98 Not when Clement has won her. But I begin to think matters cannot be prosperous.â\\x80\\x99 It was a point of honour at the Rectory that Mr. Clayton should see all the lions of the neighbourhood, although they were not new to him. His nieces walked with him to the points from whence the finest views were visible. Mr. Follaton took him into a wonderful receptacle, under St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s tower, to Show him three precious and begrimed old tiles ; and he spent the usual day at Defforton, lunching at Clementâ\\x80\\x99s, and finding him in a very unsatisfactory condition of irritation and excita 172 bility, which Mr. Clayton charitably laid to one door, and won 172 dered why things, which might have to all appearances run so - smoothly, should be taking crooked turns. So the days passed by, and on Saturday Mr. Clayton and Joyce were to leave. The latter was surprised that nothing had been said about Elsie accompanying them; but she never teased her father, and did not again allude to the subject. He wanted more satisfactory knowledge of Bella ; but she avoided 28434 ONE YEAR. him by every possible device, and kept the same reserved de 172 meanour, though her face grew more dreary every day ; and her uncleâ\\x80\\x99s brightest, kindest words failed to â\\x96\\xa0win any response. He had made up his mind, however, that he would get behind the wall of reserve she had set up between herself and the family, and a few words of Miss Villars rendered him more determined. â\\x80\\x98 Mr. Clayton,â\\x80\\x99 she said to him one day, â\\x80\\x98 do you think you could manage to say something to Bella ? She is very unhappy, I see ; and I am sure I am very unhappy,â\\x80\\x99 she continued, tears filling her gentle eyes. â\\x80\\x98 I suppose Joyce has told you all about that sad, sad business ? I cannot have managed her rightly, and, indeed, you do not know how I feel my unfitness for the posi 172 tion I am placed in, and the girlsâ\\x80\\x99 disadvantages in consequence. But there does not seem any help for it,â\\x80\\x99 she went on, thinking of her own shortcomings, with a sigh ; â\\x80\\x98 only, do you think you could speak to Bella ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is like interference,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Clayton, a little reluctantly. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, no ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Miss Villars, eagerlyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 an uncle and a clergyman ; and I have not dared to say anything about it to my brother-in-law ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 There, if you will excuse me for saying so, I cannot think you are right. There can be no possible doubt that he ought to know.â\\x80\\x99 She looked very much distressed. â\\x80\\x98 Do you indeed feel so strongly ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I should feel very strongly indeed if I stood in his place.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Poor Bella will be so broken-hearted. And it does not seem quite fair to her, so long after, does it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I suspect that no misery would be so unbearable as she is suffering now.â\\x80\\x99WHAT JOYCE SAID. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Mr. Clayton, I see what a terrible mistake I have made ! I do indeed reproach myself. : But if you would be so very, very good as to say a few words to Bella, and then tell me what you think I had better do.â\\x80\\x99 Â£ I shall not change my opinion, I forewarn you,â\\x80\\x99 said he, smiling ; Â£ but, if this course seems more desirable to you, I will try what can be done.â\\x80\\x99 Without seeking the opportunity more prominently than he desired, it was difficult to find it ; but in the afternoon a chance did arrive. At luncheon a walk was planned in which he was to join; but afterwards he found certain letters required an answer by that dayâ\\x80\\x99s post, and they were obliged to start -with out him, he promising to meet them on their way back. Coming into the drawing-room an hour afterwards, he found Bella buried in one of the great arm-chairs, reading. When she saw him, she sprang up in dismay. Â£ Uncle Reginald ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Not gone with the others, Bella? â\\x80\\x99 Â£ I had a headache,â\\x80\\x99 she said, standing up and turning her face away. Â£ How many headaches you seem to have ! â\\x80\\x99 Â£ I canâ\\x80\\x99t help it. It is very bad ; thatâ\\x80\\x99s all I know.â\\x80\\x99 Â£ Poor child ! â\\x80\\x99 She twisted herself uneasily, and glanced at the door. Â£ Sit down again in that great chair, and let us have a quiet talk. I want to ask you a question. I have not said anything about it yet, from doubt whether you would like it ; but, sup 172 posing I can gain permission, do you feel disposed to go back to London with us ? â\\x80\\x99 Bella looked at her uncle, and tears slowly gathered in her eyes. Â£ Away from Elmwood ? â\\x80\\x99 she said, with a deep sigh of relief ; 28â\\x80\\x942436 ONE YEAR. then her face changed again, and hardened into the old expres 172 sion. â\\x80\\x98 You and Joyce ? No, thank you, I could not go.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And why not with Joyce?â\\x80\\x99 he said, determined to take the subject by the horns at once. â\\x80\\x98Why not with Joyce?â\\x80\\x99 he repeated, as she continued silent. â\\x80\\x98 She sets my sisters against me,â\\x80\\x99 was the dogged answer. â\\x80\\x98 Surely not.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She does ; â\\x80\\x99 and suddenly, to his great amazement, Bella burst into a passion of sobs, so violently uncontrollable that the few words he attempted to say were quite unheard ; and he held his peace, glad that, at any cost, the long silence was breaking. But he would not let her rush away, when the fit had partially exhausted itself. He put his hand on her arm, and said gravely, but kindly, â\\x80\\x98 Why do you think that Joyce would do as you say, Bella? It is not at all like her.â\\x80\\x99 A little awed by her uncleâ\\x80\\x99s manner, she stammered some 172 thing about â\\x80\\x98 everybody â\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98 unkindness.â\\x80\\x99 *\\' Suppose we put aside others, and get to the root of the matter. Something is making you very miserable, my poor child, and it would be far better for you to talk it over.â\\x80\\x99 There was no withstanding the tone of interest. Bella looked up and sobbed, â\\x80\\x98 Indeed, I did not think it was so wrong.â\\x80\\x99 Luckily, Mr. Clayton knew enough from Joyce to understand the reference, and to be able to answer, â\\x80\\x98 It would have gone on to worse if your eyes had not been opened. Any shame, any punishment, is better than the misery of being left to ourselves.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Every one has turned against me ! â\\x80\\x99 Then finding she re-WHAT JOYCE SAID. 437 ceived no answer, she continued, â\\x80\\x98 They all do things that are not right sometimes ; I donâ\\x80\\x99t see why I should be picked out.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Has Miss Villars turned against you, as you call it?â\\x80\\x99 asked Mr. Clayton, quietly. â\\x80\\x98No; but Joyce hasâ\\x80\\x94and Elsie.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Bella ! And you mean to say that anger with them has all this time kept you back from seeking your peace with God ! What days, what weeks, of wretchedness you must have suf 172 fered ! â\\x80\\x99 A great sob was the answer. â\\x80\\x98 Once or twice Iâ\\x80\\x94I nearly told Aunt Clare that I was sorry ; but Joyce looked as if she despised me so, and I thought she should not know I minded.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton sighed. â\\x80\\x98 Surely you have learnt that all such things are as nothing compared with the reality of which one has to think. It is putting the fear of man first. Bella, your Confirmation-time cannot be very far off.â\\x80\\x99 She shrank back with a distressed look. * Only think of thatâ\\x80\\x94think of the outspoken profession on which no shade of any cowardice must rest.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I canâ\\x80\\x99t beâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to be confirmed ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 That is to say, you desire no strengthâ\\x80\\x94seek no help : you are content to rest upon yourself. Have the last weeks per 172 mitted you to feel that ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, no ! â\\x80\\x99 * Then you mean, you dare not ask for Godâ\\x80\\x99s blessing ? I do not wonder, my poor Bella,â\\x80\\x99 he said, sadlyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 I do not wonder that you fear. If all this time you have felt your sin and never owned it, it must have hung over you like a dreary shadow, blotting out everything that is fair and good. It is useless to43 8 ONE YEAR. attempt to deceive ourselves : we can have no hope without repentance.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You will not believe me if I say what is the truth,â\\x80\\x99 said Bella, quickly. I will believe you entirely.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I know I have been all wrong ; I am sorry.â\\x80\\x99 She spoke in a very low voice, and her face grew crimson as she made the acknowledgment. â\\x80\\x98 Then,â\\x80\\x99 said her uncle, cheerfully, â\\x80\\x98 you are taking one step in the right path. And the first is the hardest. If you are really sorryâ\\x80\\x94sorry for the sin, I mean, and not taken up with thinking of the consequencesâ\\x80\\x94you will not mind what difficulties stand in the way of proving your repentance.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Uncle Regie, what ought I to do ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You ought to confess all to your father.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, no ; donâ\\x80\\x99t say that !â\\x80\\x99 She turned upon him a frightened, imploring look. â\\x80\\x98I cannot do thatâ\\x80\\x94anything else ; but he does not know. I cannot, I cannot ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Then I cannot help you,â\\x80\\x99 he replied, resolutely. â\\x80\\x98If you could only understand that no bitterness of disgrace can equal the bitterness of sin, you would not hesitate.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I have told you â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes. Thank God that you have done so, because it has cost you something. And, by His grace, you can go on to do what you know to be right.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, it would be so hard. I should not know what to say.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton was silent. â\\x80\\x98 I will tell Aunt Clare,â\\x80\\x99 she said, piteously. â\\x80\\x98 I have always wanted to tell her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 That means only that you will accept the relief without the shame.â\\x80\\x99WHAT JOYCE SAID. 439 She was trembling and looking imploring, and her uncle felt a great deal of compassion for her weakness ; but he believed a victory now, at whatever cost, to be of infinite importance; and he would not yield even so far as to take away the first difficulty, by himself going to Mr. Follaton. She needed a sharp lesson, and he believed she was having it, when, in the midst of more tears, she sobbed out, * If you say I must, I must ; but you donâ\\x80\\x99t know how dreadful it is to tell papa ! And I donâ\\x80\\x99t know where to begin.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 One word about that, Bella. When you are thinking over your fault, remember that the beginning of all this stretches very far back. They are the little daily slipsâ\\x80\\x94want of care, want of accuracyâ\\x80\\x94that prepare the mind for exaggeration, and lead it, little by little, out of the path of truth. Your father will tell you what vigilance you will require.â\\x80\\x99 He put his hand kindly on her shoulder as he spoke, and then he went away and left her, not wishing to do more than lead her to her rightful earthly guide, but feeling as if Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s share in the matter had made his interference so far desirable. That evening Bella did not come down ; Miss Villars looked tearfully happy, and Mr. Follaton restless. No occupation of his own appeared to please him ; but as he and his brother-in- law were separating for the night, he wrung Mr. Claytonâ\\x80\\x99s hand, saying, â\\x80\\x98 Thank you for your goodness to my poor child. I have been very blind.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It has led to her giving good proof of repentance ; for I suspect that, with a nature like Bellaâ\\x80\\x99s, confession needs a con 172 siderable effort.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She is in a sad state yet.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Suppose you were to let her go back with us on Saturday,44Â° ONE YEAR. and send Elsie as well ? It seems to me that such a break is of advantage when there has been a sort of smiting down of self- respect, as is the case with her. You would trust me to look after her ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I must think of it,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Follaton, ponderingly. â\\x80\\x98The Confirmation hangs heavy on her heart, poor child ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I have hopes that it will come to her now at a time when she not only needs it, but feels the need.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Motherless children ! â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Clayton heard his brother-in-law say under his breath. â\\x80\\x98Wellâ\\x80\\x94thank you. We are all indebted to you; but you must let me think it over before I can deter 172 mine.â\\x80\\x99 His determination was announced the next morning, a little more promptly, and without appeal, than Mr. Clayton was pre 172 pared to hear. He thought Bella would have some choice given her, and he pitied the look of. dismay with which she listened. But, apparently, Mr. Follaton had made up his mind that there should be no hesitation in carrying out the course he resolved upon; and Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s astonishment prevented any notice being taken of her sister. In the excitement and difficulties of prepa 172 ration, when preparation was only allowed one day, Elsie had not time to be sure whether she liked or disliked the notion ; and Joyce was so kind and so delighted that she gave her cousin no opportunity for indulging in frightened forebodings. But Bella was going where once she had longed to go, with all the brightness taken out of her prospect. True, Joyce had voluntarily told her father that she believed her own want of forbearance grievously stood in her cousinâ\\x80\\x99s way ; nor did he deny her.â\\x80\\x94True, Bella turned to Mr. Clayton with an affection which made her content if only he was in the room ; but yet there was a sore feeling of shame, rendering it hard to go unlessWHAT JOYCE SAID. it had been to those who knew nothing of her fault ; and she clung to Miss Villars as if until now she had never known the worth of that unwearying, trustful love which seemed as if it could not fail or falter. Ursule came early in the morning to wish the travellers good 172 bye. â\\x80\\x98Why does she not look a little brighter?â\\x80\\x99 thought Joyce, impatiently. â\\x80\\x98She will come back soon,â\\x80\\x99 thought Ursule. But still she wondered that Clement had not been there since Mr. Claytonâ\\x80\\x99s first days at the Vicarage. She wondered that Mr. Clayton should have spoken in so warm a tone of kindness, and said so markedly that ere long he hoped they would be better known to each other. She wondered most of all to hear Joyce sending a message through Anne to Clement, to the effect that, in case she did not see him before the summer was over, he might be sure her mother would like the cuttings he proposed sending. â\\x80\\x98What does it all mean?â\\x80\\x99 Ursule thought in amazement. And in the railway-carriage Mr. Claytonâ\\x80\\x99s first speech made Elsie and Bella open their eyes in amazement greater still. â\\x80\\x98We must resign ourselves, I supposeâ\\x80\\x99 he said, with a sigh, â\\x80\\x98 to see less of Clement ; but I really believe she will make him a most sweet little wife.â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER XXV. UNDER THE CEDARS. She smiled securelyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 He loves me purely : A true heartâ\\x80\\x99s safe, both in smile and frown; And nothing harms me while his love warms me, Whether the world go up or down.â\\x80\\x99 Poems by the author of 6 John Halifax * \\'as in May that Ursule learned what it all meant. Something prevented Mr. Blunt from coming to mwood on the day the four travellers left the another Saturday arrived before he could, with a clear conscience, find himself at the Cottage. Letters had been received from both the sistersâ\\x80\\x94Elsie ecstatically happy, de 172 lighted with her prospects of sight-seeing, and able to find amusement in an outside view of the throng of a London season, while she was not obliged to do more than look on, under the care of Mrs. Clayton and Joyceâ\\x80\\x94Bella writing in a subdued tone, and with an evident yearning after her auntâ\\x80\\x99s tenderness, although, as she expressed it, everybody was very kind. As for Anne, she was more brisk than had ever been known before. Whether alone her excellent qualities had more room for expansion, whether Elsieâ\\x80\\x99s higher spirits quenched, and Rectory; andUNDER THE CEDARS. 443 Joyce frightened her, or whether a few words of encouragement which Mr. Clayton let fall, accompanied by what seemed a chance remark, to the effect that the profit of others is often best effected by pleasing them, worked the change, it is impos 172 sible to say. The only certainty is, that she forced herself into exertions from which she had hitherto persistently shrunk ; and that it was evident they were wholesome exertions, and likely to be persevered in like Anneâ\\x80\\x99s other conscientious beginnings. The place was quieter than ever : even the little stir kept up by the goings and comings from the Hall was wanting, since Mrs. Chambers was away in London, and the place given up to servants. Ursule was glad. Ever since that memorable dinner-party, Mrs. Chambers had been kind to her; indeed, rather enthusiastic in her praise. But, although she fought bravely against the feeling, she experienced a sense of weariness and a longing for quiet which made all solitude grateful. And she liked better to walk to the Hall, and saunter under the cedars, watching the blue expanse of sea glimmer between a veil of flickering leaves, without fear of interruption or remark, than to hear Mr. Chambersâ\\x80\\x99s kindly greeting or his hospitable suggestion that she should stay to luncheon. Now and thenâ\\x80\\x94very rarelyâ\\x80\\x94she received a few lines from her father, written always in the same language of easy selfish 172 ness; not averse to her enjoying her share of the good things of the earth, so long as his own was secured to him. He was interested in her accession of richesâ\\x80\\x94the more so, since it did away with the necessity for remittances. â\\x80\\x98 Be prudent, above all things, my dear child,â\\x80\\x99 he wrote. â\\x80\\x98 Should adverse circumstances occur, for which it is the part of a wise man to be prepared, it will, I know, rejoice your dutiful heart to offer a home to your father in his old age. I look forward to it as a resource ;444 ONE YEAR. for that pastoral life you describe so charmingly, although a shade remains upon it ofâ\\x80\\x94well, we will not say dulness, we will call it sobriety, such as possesses a positive charm for the young, may one day invite me to take refuge in its arms. As yet the Brussels existence has not exhausted its attractions, but it delights me occasionally to indulge a dream of flight to your little contented household.â\\x80\\x99 Such hints made Ursule shiver with the dread of what might happen to Madame should her father appear, and expect her to support him, and to wonder whether it would have been better for Madame, if she had indeed removed to that other home, which was beginning again to look strangely unreal and misty, and herself gone back in answer to Madame Sansonâ\\x80\\x99s perpetual pleadings for her return. But Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurigny had no wish of the kind. The life she led, in spite of the pain, suited her better than that of Dieppe. More acquaintances had sought her ; she had a larger share of actual comfort. She grumbled, but, on the whole, she was not discontented with her lot. Always, indeed, in spite of her growing affection for her young com 172 panion, self engrossed the first thought; and now her mind was occupied with, and her lips continually talking of, Clement and his prospects, until poor Ursule, haunted by that strange afternoon in the green-house, felt sick at heart, and a disbe 172 liever in Madameâ\\x80\\x99s prognostications of the immense happiness in store for the young couple, and would be driven to seek for peace elsewhere. It was on one such occasion that she and Jock escaped to the shelter of the Hall cedars, when the day was sufficiently hot and dry for her to fling herself down upon the grass, and wonder at the marvellous beauty of all around her. She had a book in her pocket; but a better book lay open before her, andUNDER THE CEDARS. 445 she did not begin to read. There was an hour at her own dis 172 posal, before she needed to think of her return to Madame, and no fear of interruptions. The cedars, in their calm, solemn majesty, stood like kings in the midst of the other trees, unaf 172 fected by the passing seasons, and wearing always an unfading crown. The air was full of buzz and life ; the birds sang jubi 172 lantly in the branches ; the distant break of the waves came up regularly : and every sound was beautiful and in 4 sweet accord.â\\x80\\x99 How long Ursule sat there she could never tell ; when she- looked up, it was with a start, for some one was making his way rapidly towards her across the grass, and, to her amazement, she recognized the intruder as Mr. Blunt. Jock was leaping round him, and giving glad welcome, by the time she was on her feet, listening to his quick explanation. 4 1 have been successful at last ! Bessie informed me that she thought you had gone to the Hall.â\\x80\\x99 Poor Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s heart beat : it was hard that all her efforts to escape persecution should have been in vain ; harder still to drive back the glad throb called up by something in his manner. But she remembered Joyce, and answered coldly, 4 1 am sorry you should have taken so much trouble.â\\x80\\x99 Then, faltering as she caught his pained look, 4 We are just going home : perhapsâ\\x80\\x94perhaps you would like to go on, and see the gardens ? â\\x80\\x99 4 No, thank you,â\\x80\\x99 answered Clement, slowly; 4 that was not my purpose in coming here.â\\x80\\x99 He stopped, and Ursule felt as if such pauses would be un 172 endurable. She was still standing where he had found her, unwilling to move lest he should- offer to return, unwilling, also, to protract the interview by remaining; not knowing what she should do, but conscious that, at all risks, long uncomfortable pauses had better be avoided.446 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98I think we must go/ slie repeated, offering her hand in desperation. Clement took no notice of the proffer. He stood still, looking a little moodily at the grass and the inoffensive daisies under his feet. Jock went up, and put his cold nose into his hand in token of sympathy ; Ursule grew impatient of her situation. 1 Allons, Jock,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98Oood-bye, Monsieur.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, starting forward ; â\\x80\\x98 we are going the same way, as far as I know. Or did you really suppose that I have walked here for the purpose of saying no more than two words ? â\\x80\\x99 She would not answer. She called all her dignity to her aid, and, by way of safeguard, asked whether he had heard very lately from Joyce. â\\x80\\x98Not since she left,â\\x80\\x99 was the careless reply, which left her half wondering, half indignant at his coolness. But the next words set her thoughts in a whirl. â\\x80\\x98 Why are you like this ?â\\x96\\xa0â\\x80\\x94 what has changed you lately? Oh, Ursule, do not tell me that all this time I have been buoying myself up with false hopesâ\\x80\\x94 you must know what they are. Will you not give me one word of assurance?â\\x80\\x99 He poured out the words with eager rapidity. Frightened and bewildered, she could only stammer, â\\x80\\x98Joyce â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Joyce ! What has she to do with the matter?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Monsieur, butâ\\x80\\x94you told Madame thatâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What ? Nothing but that I loved you, my Ursule ! â\\x80\\x99 It flashed upon her in a moment ; the bright flush deepened on her cheeks ; she covered her face with her hands. Clement had his answer, though no sound was heard but a burst of 7 O thrush-song from the wood. â\\x80\\x98Where has been the doubt?â\\x80\\x99 he asked tenderly, drawingUNDER THE CEDARS. 447 away her hands, and triumphing in the shy glance that for one moment met his own. â\\x80\\x98 Surely, you have not been blind to my secret ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I could not understand,â\\x80\\x99 she whispered ; â\\x80\\x98 and Madame told me that you had talked ofâ\\x80\\x94Joyce; and you had settled Madame should live with you. Was it not so, truly?â\\x80\\x99 she said, raising her head quickly, with a sudden access of doubt. â\\x80\\x98 Ah, Monsieur, do you mean what you say ? â\\x80\\x99 He smiled at the notion. â\\x80\\x98 Every word. And, you may be assured, never a thing have I said to my aunt, out of which any other meaning could be extracted. I can only suppose she set off with a false impression, so that, somehow or other, we played at cross purposes.â\\x80\\x99 But still she did not look quite satisfied, and Clement per 172 ceived the shadow. â\\x80\\x98 That must have made the mischief,â\\x80\\x99 he said, anxiously. â\\x80\\x98Yes ; only, have you thought it all overâ\\x80\\x94are you sure ? I am not like Joyce, or one of your young English ladies : in my country, you know that I am not even as I am here; and Madame says you must \\'all look down upon me. I am afraid that Mr. Blunt, under his breath, muttered some hard words of Madame. â\\x80\\x98 And,â\\x80\\x99 went on Ursule, lifting her little head, and speaking bravely, â\\x80\\x98if it is to humiliate you, I will never marry youâ\\x80\\x94 never, never ! â\\x80\\x99 But, as she looked up, she met his eyes fixed upon her so tenderly that she felt a trembling conviction that her bravery would not long hold out. And when in low quiet words he began to speak, standing before her with the sea behind him and the cedars over his head, when he told her how dear she wasâ\\x80\\x94how thankful he felt for the gift of her loveâ\\x80\\x94how he had448 ONE YEAR. been tormented with the dread that she would suspect him of caring for the recovery of his home, instead of caring for herâ\\x80\\x94 how, during the past weeks, he had waited and longed for one sign of kindly interest, and was alternately urged on and kept back by impatience and fear for the resultâ\\x80\\x94how, at length, stung with a determination to know the worst, he had followed her that morning to put his hopes to the touchâ\\x80\\x94all misgivings faded completely out of her heart, and the deep radiant happi 172 ness of her smile contented even Clement. Nevertheless, a lurking mischief made her say, as they walked home the roundabout way, through green lanes and down a hill as steep as a roof, â\\x80\\x98 Ah, but you disliked me with all your might, Monsieur Clement.â\\x80\\x99 Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s first surprise was exceedingly entertain 172 ing. Ursule was grateful that it was only surprise and not displeasure, for which she was prepared, her humility acknow 172 ledging herself all unworthy of her happiness. But, indeed, Madame, when once she had recovered from the shock of finding her prophecies in error, was very glad at heart. That Clement and Ursule should both have their homes at the Cottage, and that she need yield neither of those who were most dear to her, was so thoroughly a fulfilment of what she desired, that, for one whole day, no power of complaining seemed to remain with her. More than that it would have been idle to expect ; and what was any complaining to Ursule, with so deep a well of happiness in her own thoughts ? She was too grateful for the sunshine that came to her with Clement to shrink from whatever roughness yet lay in her path ; and, indeed, before this sunshine came, she had not shrunk. What had seemed dreary and difficult when she felt herself indifferent to Madame, she had conscientiously endeavoured to go throughUNDER THE CEDARS. 449 with as a duty ; out of the duty grew affection ; and then, as in Madameâ\\x80\\x99s heart there awoke something beyond the mere dependence of selfishnessâ\\x80\\x94then there came the beginning of the reward. Better for her than even the sad, sweet teaching brought by Louisâ\\x80\\x99 death had been the daily training of the last few months ; and Clement, looking proudly at her, and wondering how he could have ever so misjudged her, was charging himself with blindness more severely than he deserved. He was resolved there should be no delay, nor, indeed, could Ursule bring forth any plea for it. Holidays were not at all times practicable ; and when he had proved beyond question that it would be ruinous to his prospects to take one at any other time than at the end of the following month, what was to be said ? The trustees were highly satisfied with the proposed marriage, feeling themselves secured by its means from certain awkward contingencies which it was not impossible might arise ; and as to the wonder of relations and acquaintances, that expended itself upon the first announcement of the tidings. At the Rectory, Anne and Miss Villars talked and wondered, and wondered and talked ; and Miss Villars could not be sure whether it was her duty to be sorry while her kindly nature inclined her to be glad, until Ursule, with smiles and blushes, showed her Mr. Claytonâ\\x80\\x99s hearty letter of congratulation, and its warmth of tone and unquestionable pleasure assured her that she might indulge her own sympathy to the fullest. Mr. Clayton had been let into the secret, before he left Elm 172 wood, by Clement, so that the news had no chance of taking him by surprise ; and he was comically delighted at having, moreover, been the first upon whom a suspicion of the course matters were taking had dawned.

Mr. Clayton had been let into the secret, before he left Elm 172 wood, by Clement, so that the news had no chance of taking him by surprise; and he was comically delighted at having, moreover, been the first upon whom a suspicion of the course matters were taking had dawned. And Joyce ? If she answered her father with a shade less of brightness than usual, it was too :945Â° ONE YEAR. slight for any one to notice it ; if she spent a little more than her ordinary time in the quiet of her own room, it was not to waste the hours in selfish repinings, but to pray with a single heart for the welfare of one who had been to her almost more than brother, and to acknowledge with thankfulness the bless 172 ing of having striven to follow her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s advice, and to keep watch and ward over her inner thoughts. And when she came down, it was prepared to fight all Ur- suleâ\\x80\\x99s battles, if battles were needed before Elsie accepted her as a cousin. But she found, to her amusement, that the very fact of cousinship constituted a superior being. â\\x80\\x98 I was beginning to like her,â\\x80\\x99 said Elsie, â\\x80\\x98 and now, of course, one must.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 By force of what ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, in a sort of way, she will belong to the family, and wonâ\\x80\\x99t any longer seem strange.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, checking the answer she was going to make, â\\x80\\x98 you know I never can understand the principles upon which it is necessary to confine oneâ\\x80\\x99s likings to the circle im 172 mediately touching one ; but, if you wonâ\\x80\\x99t mind my saying so, Elsie, it seems to me as if that reason of yours carried us a good deal further than you allow.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How do you mean ? â\\x80\\x99 asked her cousin, with some wonder. Then, as it dawned upon her, she added, hurriedly, â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Joyce, surely not in such little things as I mean ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Donâ\\x80\\x99t you think so ? I canâ\\x80\\x99t see where the application ends : it must take in the little things, for, as to that, it is in those very little things that one has so much more to do with people than in great. I am only repeating what I once heard papa say, when some one was talking about this very thing, and making out that faults of manner and off-hand ways did noUNDER THE CEDARS. harm. He would not allow it, and said that as want of outward kindliness between brothers and sisters was wrong, so one ought to cultivate a loving spirit with all those with whom one comes in contact, and that it was best effected by keeping the great family bond in view. And, when one thinks of it, it is really an absurd contradiction to profess the spirit, and allow oneself to be disagreeable and repellant.â\\x80\\x99 Joyce paused, a little afraid that she might have hurt her cousin. But Elsie was too sweet-tempered and conscientious to take offence at words such as these. She sat in the window- seat in the drawing-room, where the two girls were alone, and she folded her arms on the window-ledge, and looked out into vacancy, while she turned the matter in her mind. â\\x80\\x98 I wonder whether you are right,â\\x80\\x99 she said, thoughtfully, at last, when Joyce had given up much expectation of an answer. â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t think we have ever looked at it in that light ; and so long as we were happy in ourselves, it didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem much differ 172 ence about troubling over other people. But I do think it must be right to be as pleasant as Uncle Reginald, and, though he is a clergyman, perhaps one ought not to feel the less bound.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, indeed ! â\\x80\\x99 said Joyce, amused. â\\x80\\x98 One thing, I must say, makes me fancy you may be rightâ\\x80\\x94 poor Bella. I believe she had a great wish to be pleasant and popular with everybody, and that, instead of helping her to treat it rightly, Anne and Iâ\\x80\\x94I especiallyâ\\x80\\x94made fun of it, and took a sort of pride in showing that we thought it a fine thing to be disagreeable to people. You know what I mean. And so, I suspect, this made the temptation to run into the opposite extreme more powerful to her, and, in wanting to avoid our ways, she fell into trouble herself.â\\x80\\x99 29â\\x80\\x94245 2 ONE YEAR. â\\x80\\x98Poor Bella! It is very hard to break off that habit of exaggeration ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She is trying, I am sure.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, indeed,â\\x80\\x99 answered Joyce, heartily; â\\x80\\x98papa says he is often touched to see how much.â\\x80\\x99 And there the conversation ended, not to be forgotten. Something in it had taken hold of Elsie. Such a motive as Joyce suggested, if it was in its right place, could not be neglected. Moreover, the very thought of it gave a spur to what otherwise seemed only disagreeable and useless. Perhaps the little introduction into a new world, and that world Lon 172 don, made the efforts easier; but certainly Joyce remarked with satisfaction that Elsie no longer fled at the sound of the front-door bell, or sat looking unutterable things from remote corners of the room when visitors were ushered in. Joyceâ\\x80\\x99s life, with her fund of activity and energy, could not be otherwise than busy; nor would her father have had it otherwise. The qualities were too precious to be repressed ; but with thankful contentment he saw added to them a growing humility, the fruit of a truer knowledge of herselfâ\\x80\\x94nay, of a germ of the conviction which comes but slowly to such natures, that work, high and holy as it is, is not in itself the highest and holiest thingâ\\x80\\x94is a means, but not the end. And if to her the happiness might never be granted which in the glad brightness of early summer made Ursuleâ\\x80\\x99s heart quiver with joy as she walked by Clementâ\\x80\\x99s side through the cool, green Elmwood lanes, God holds in His own hands the secret springs of glad 172 ness, and assuredly they should be poured upon her in His good measure. For Ursule, the brightness of life filled her with grateful won 172 der. The restful sense of dependence was a new delight, un-UNDER THE CEDARS. 453 known even in her love for Louis. Always she had been accus 172 tomed to act independently, to act and to advise ; and to have one to whom she could look for guidance, whose bidding it was happiness to obey, seemed to her a privilege for which she could never be sufficiently thankful. And yet, with all this sweet, shy clinging, Clement felt that his little wife would never yield him a blind obedience ; her love was too deep and true for thatâ\\x80\\x94too thoroughly interwoven with the other love which, little by little, step by step, had guided her into the knowledge of itself. Looking up at him one morning wistfully, she said, â\\x80\\x98 Clement, you have read my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s letter ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, I have read it,â\\x80\\x99 he said, with an indignant emphasis which did not escape her. She sighed as she went onâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 I think he means to be kind in what he saysâ\\x80\\x94in his good wishes.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Good wishes are inexpensive,â\\x80\\x99 answered Clement drily. â\\x80\\x98 Seriously, I cannot think calmly of his conduct, made up, as it is, of unmitigated selfishness. When in the world has he ever acted towards you as if he felt the smallest fatherly affection ? What possible claim could he have the face to make for dutyâ\\x80\\x99s sake ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, much distressed, â\\x80\\x98 pray, do not say that. You do not know how ill I used to behave. Do not say that again, or I shall be afraid to ask the favour I want you to grant.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What ? â\\x80\\x99 he inquired eagerly. â\\x80\\x98 You are so good ; you are going to take me to Dieppe, you know. Dear old Madame, how delighted she will be !â\\x80\\x94what a welcome she will give us ! But, Clement, if you would not dislike it very much, if you would also let me go to Brussels â\\x80\\x99 She hesitated. Clement bit his lip, and looked vexed. She454 ONE YEAR. went on with her gentle pleading, â\\x80\\x98 He is my fatherâ\\x80\\x94the only relation belonging to me : it would make me very happy.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Would it?â\\x80\\x99 he said presently, after a pause; â\\x80\\x98then we will go. I believe, after all, that you are right ; but, right or wrong, you have cared for my aunt too long for me to object to any sacrifice you may think it well to make for your father. Are you satisfied, my Ursule?â\\x80\\x99 Such deep tenderness as breathed in his voice, such love as looked out from his eyes, were indeed enough to content her, and to call up happy tears. With a little mute action of thank 172 fulness, she slid her hand into his. â\\x80\\x98 We must not leave Madame desolate very long.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Miss Villars will take care of that. Since she has become a favourite, it has made matters easier.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah, Clement, everything has grown easy now. When I look back, and remember those past days, with their burdens of solitudeâ\\x80\\x94when everything appeared gloomy, and I could do no better than judge by externalsâ\\x80\\x94it seems to me most wonder 172 ful that all my repining has been so borne with, that this has been sent at the end. What would Louis say ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98We shall never forget him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 He is nearer than ever in my happiness. I often think how the things I have been slow in learning he accepted without rebellion ; and it seems to me now, as if what most we wanted â\\x80\\x94Church blessings, I mean, of which we knew so littleâ\\x80\\x94were supplied to him in some mysterious manner. How he would have appreciated them ! â\\x80\\x99 And Clement repeated, under his breath, â\\x80\\x98 The communion of saints.â\\x80\\x99 The words recurred to them both on a fair June morning, when the sun shone gloriously down upon the elms in St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99sUNDER THE CEDARS. 455 churchyard, and the bells pealed merrily in the tower, and man and wife came forth from the old porch to begin their life together, with Godâ\\x80\\x99s blessing making their happiness holy. The villagers clustered round the path. â\\x80\\x98 Thereâ\\x80\\x99s Mr. Clement !\\' said one. â\\x80\\x98 I canâ\\x80\\x99t get a sight of her face,â\\x80\\x99 said another. Never 172 theless, Ursule herself had caught a glimpse of two spectators, and she pressed her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s arm with a thrill of proud delight. Little Phil Blake and his mother stood open-eyed, and gazing at Clement with all the satisfaction in the world that they had something to tell of him on a day when he was the centre of all eyes. â\\x80\\x98 They must come to the dinner,â\\x80\\x99 whispered Ursule. â\\x80\\x98 I will tell Anne.â\\x80\\x99 The commission put Anne at her ease, and made her very happy. Perhaps, indeed, it was Clementâ\\x80\\x99s manner in asking her which gave her courage to whisper a few words to Ursule, as the latter came out of Madame dâ\\x80\\x99Aurignyâ\\x80\\x99s room, with a smile of infinite happiness shining through tearful eyes. â\\x80\\x98 Elsie and I are very sorry, though she is not here to say so,â\\x80\\x99 said Anne, bluntly and nervously ; â\\x80\\x98 we werenâ\\x80\\x99t kind : and Bella wished me to beg your pardon.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, pray,â\\x80\\x99 began Ursule, much distressed ; but then seeing that Anne would not be satisfied without her saying something more than a mere disclaimer, stopped herself, and added, in a different tone, â\\x80\\x98 If it will make her happier, I hope you will give her my love. And tell Elsie,â\\x80\\x99 she continued, with a brightness which veiled a deeper feeling, â\\x80\\x98 that I love her Elmwood even better than she can love it. When I look back to last year â\\x80\\x99 Clement overheard the words and the faltering tone ; for the cousins had reached the foot of the stairs. â\\x80\\x98 When we look back but one year, my darling,â\\x80\\x99 he whispered tenderly, bending',\n",

Often minded I have been to pen a small history of this here Cornish parish, called â\\x80\\x98 Vogue Parish.â\\x80\\x99 The habitants are brushing up to a thousand ; most of â\\x80\\x99em are congregate into the Port of Polvogueâ\\x80\\x94a few housen on the high land called the Church Town ; after that it is all farmsteads, hid away in snug nooks ; for we be open to the Atlantic, and a souâ\\x80\\x99 172 wester â\\x80\\x99long with we is a souâ\\x80\\x99-wester, and no mistake, and it do blow a bit from easterâ\\x80\\x99d tu! The sea is every side of Vogue Parish, except a bit of neck of land that join the main-IO IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP land, and the waves of the sea only do beat the parish bounds. Now, this is the year of Grace 1818, and I, Robert Rowe, have been twenty years parish clerk, and father and son, we have been a family of parish clerks from Queen Anneâ\\x80\\x99s reign. By trade we have been tailors. As I say, it is nigh upon a score oâ\\x80\\x99 years since I first took duty in Vogue Parish Church. Our parson then was Dr Tregonpol. He called round to our house, as he heard father was sick, so he say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Fret thee not, Robert Rowe, thee canâ\\x80\\x99st not fill the desk Sunday ; but we will appoint young Robert to try his lungs with a good Amen, and he inherits the lungs of his father, to fill old Vogue Church no doubt.â\\x80\\x99 So I took the clerkâ\\x80\\x99s duty next Sunday, and they did say my â\\x80\\x98 Amenâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x99 was like the cracks of a cart whip. â\\x80\\x99Twas a fine old church, and â\\x80\\x99twas crowded. Dr Tregonpol put fine store by the old carved oak benches, the menâ\\x80\\x99s aisle and the womanâ\\x80\\x99s. (â\\x80\\x99Twas thought a fine bold thing to do for any woman in Vogue Parish to sit in the menâ\\x80\\x99s aisle.)Lord Respry. â\\x80\\x9cWe are obligugied to your Reverence for YOUR LEARNED DISCOURSE.â\\x80\\x9dWTTM OLD > thatâ\\x80\\x99s me and Mr J nter Do to open benches ar. : > .re to v When I followed th \\'Â¡\\\\var< vestry they counted tht > and away.

When I followed the churchwardens into the vestry they counted the money, and was gone away. Dr Tregonpol says, looking at me sted-dy over his gold rims,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98You did well Robert Rowe, junior; but let me impress upon you this single fact that there is no i in Moses, it is not MoisÃ©s. â\\x80\\x98Thank you, sir!â\\x80\\x99 says I, â\\x80\\x98I hope I shaâ\\x80\\x99nâ\\x80\\x99t forget to pernounce it short. But the best that sails will ship a sea sometime ! When I have pitched my voice out to the gallilee I may ship a sea, careless ways, and call MoisÃ©s and A-ar-run.â\\x80\\x99 Then, as I was a following Dr Tregonpol out into the churchyard, Lord Respry of Tre- vogue, the other Squire, he was awaiting the Parson ; with his hat off he says the same form as grace after meal. â\\x80\\x98 We are obligee-gi-ed to your reverence for you learned discourse. Will you favour us with your company to dinner.â\\x80\\x9916 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP â\\x80\\x98 No thank you, my lord, no ; hare-pie at home to-day!â\\x80\\x99 answered Dr Tregonpol. â\\x80\\x98 Now, as I have begun the day with Sunday Iâ\\x80\\x99ll finish it up to the evening. Dr Tregonpol he preached with a big church-lantern and he had an hour-glass on a stand ; but he mostly forgot to set that hour-glass till he was half voyage on, and then he turned it, and he would never finish up till the last speck of sand had run down to the glass globe below. It was hard on courtship of a Sunday, and I were young and went a-courting in those days. But he being a bachelor gentleman he did not seem to con 172 sider courtship as part of the business of the world, though he had a tender heart for the young and aged, the sick and the dying. So that big church was crowded, and all the laboured men would listen that attentive ; and the shadows would creep up the church till it was nigh pitchy dark, and no light but the pupit lantern, and no face to be seen but the preacher and his white hair ; a proper pictureâ\\x80\\x94 fine looks he had. Now, in this score of years, as I am a-looking back on, we had only two murders, and they was more mysteries thanWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 17 murders. One was a pedlar as come to â\\x80\\x98 Cat oâ\\x80\\x99-Bell â\\x80\\x99 one night. They was queer ones who kept the â\\x80\\x98 Cat- oâ\\x80\\x99-Bell.â\\x80\\x99 No one had a good word for that wisht old brother and sister, Garge Gait and Meary Gait. They was prettily despised, and they was creeping pious, and the textes they would bring up, in season and out oâ\\x80\\x99 season ; and we know r from the Bible the worst can do that pat enough,â\\x80\\x94but, bless you, nobody was took in by it, and least of all the Parsonâ\\x80\\x94for he was right honest in his religion, and there was no jargle in his dialoguesâ\\x80\\x94so he werenâ\\x80\\x99t the leastest bit took in ; and when he was stiff and starn he had mighty fine reason for it. They used to walk about hand in hand, Garge and Meary Gait, so they was called the â\\x80\\x98 Babes oâ\\x80\\x99 the Cat-oâ\\x80\\x99-Bell.â\\x80\\x99 They robbâ\\x80\\x99d all who fre 172 quent the â\\x80\\x98 Cat-oâ\\x80\\x99-Bell,â\\x80\\x99 so tâ\\x80\\x99was no good for they to walk innercent like, and sit under the gallilee and groan pious in the sermon ; we knowed them. The poor old pedlar ! (but the misfortune were he werenâ\\x80\\x99t poor, or maybe he would have been alive to this here day), he was â\\x80\\x99mazing rich, he had cases of watches, and18 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP ear-droppers, brooches and sich like ; no wed 172 ding ring but was bought of heâ\\x80\\x94and zollid gold, guinea gold, tu ! They called he Me-thu- sa-lem ; he was small and humpty-backed ; but he, if his head were too nigh to his heels, he made up for it by a steeple hat half as big agen as hisself. Seeming to me I shall ever remem 172 ber Me-thu-sa-lemâ\\x80\\x99s hat! Now, none did know whence he came or wheresoever he went. Some say, â\\x80\\x98he were the true Wandering Jew â\\x80\\x99 ; others say, â\\x80\\x98he were too poor in spirit for that.â\\x80\\x99 If he were the Wandering Jew his wanders were over that night in Vogue Parish. When he was seeâ\\x80\\x99d coming down Trelucky Hill, as leads down into the Church Town, the women and the childers went up to meet him with â\\x80\\x98 Heigho, Me-thu-sa-lem !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98The Pedlar have come ! â\\x80\\x99 say the men. Me-thu-sa-lem could scrape the fiddle well, and the childers, maids and lads, danced round the cross (the sun-dial), and in the evening he were fine company in the parlour of the â\\x80\\x98 Cat-oâ\\x80\\x99-Bell.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x99Twas the war time, and our ships and navy was all the talk of the world. People sent messages to their friends by Me-thu-sa-lem hundreds and hundredsWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 19 of miles away, and he returned with the answer in a year or two all right. He was merry of wit, and right di-varted the parish when he come. At last it came to night, and he packed up his watches, gold chains, gew-gaws and glitter, but it had been a sight too much for the wicked old brother and sister, Garge and Meary !â\\x80\\x94for nobody ever clapt eyes on poor old Me-thu-sa-lem again. Only the auld Jan Reel (grit-grandfather to the young Reel Crenious, his Christian name). Jan Reel had a sick cow, and he goes out with a lantern in the middle of the night, and he seeâ\\x80\\x99d a light in the yard oâ\\x80\\x99 the â\\x80\\x98 Cat-oâ\\x80\\x99-bell,â\\x80\\x99 he peeps over the stone wall, and the auld Garge Gait was drashing away with a lot oâ\\x80\\x99 rubbish throw 172 ing down the well, which was worked by a wind 172 lass and a bucket ; Meary, with a red shawl over her head, was holding the lantern. Jan Reel did not think much of it at the time ; but it seemed odd to he like, they wisht ones was out that time oâ\\x80\\x99 night to fill up the well. Now, that well was for public drink ; but the old Gaits put a lock to the yard and said they had a gone and filled up the well because the noise of â\\x80\\x98 a20 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP parcel of werman and childers a-working the creaky, rusty chains made the two wicked ones wake too early, but it gained belief in the parish that well were Me-thu-sa-lemâ\\x80\\x99s grave. Then the suspicious thing was, Garge and Meary Gait growâ\\x80\\x99d rich and they bought fields, a horse, cart and harrowâ\\x80\\x94all sorts, in fact ; but nobody looked into it, so it became a mystery. Still it was the talks for many a long day ; and the childers would screech if they saw the wisht old mortals out oâ\\x80\\x99 theirselves in the lanes, walking hand in hand, the Babes oâ\\x80\\x99 the Cat and Bell, Garge and Meary Gait. The next was a wuss murder. A poor fellow, shipwrecked, with a belt of guineas round his waist, and he was washed ashore on to the Zone Beach ; and it was told he was knocked on the head for his guineas. It was two brothers this time did it. They seemed to prosper, but after a bit one was took bad, and for twenty year he become a bag oâ\\x80\\x99 bones. He was a poor sinner, and he would climb up the cliffsâ\\x80\\x94such an old Â£ scare-ee-crow â\\x80\\x99 or may say â\\x80\\x98 scare gull and shag â\\x80\\x99 as ever was seen cliffâ\\x80\\x99s sideâ\\x80\\x94and he would shout and pray, lift his handsWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 21 above his head, he was a living witness of despair in sin to the whole parish of Vogue ; better than hundreds of sermons on the greed of gold, robbery and murder. But they left he alone, and they never had un took up. The other brother had a wisht death, too bad to tell ye of. So their sins found â\\x80\\x99em out, and not by the hand of man. And now Iâ\\x80\\x99ll begin my story, as I call this an introductory piece, to let you know a bit what sort of folk the Vogue folk were.CHAPTER II. I was often down on business and one thing and another to Tredinnick Farm House. â\\x80\\x99Twas a picture of a farm house. â\\x80\\x99Twas old, but it was that clean, white wood, scrubbed from top to bottom, and a polish on all things. We was having breakfast in the hall, or front kitchen, when I was telling Missus a bit of parish news. In comes Maister, home to breakfast. Now, Maister Anthony Bullen was a fine sight to seeâ\\x80\\x94a regular jolly John Bull. In his day he were the best wrastler in ten parishes round ; and â\\x80\\x98 only one single pat, and you would never rejoice again,â\\x80\\x99 he was that mighty strong. But he had a fine easy temper ; if he had been ugly in temper, no man could have stood up against him. But Missus were differ from Maister, and she were capâ\\x80\\x99en of he. To-day Maister looked gloom- ways as he sat to table. Says Missus,â\\x80\\x94 22WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 23 â\\x80\\x98Co ! co ! Anthony, man, whatâ\\x80\\x99s up with yer long visage? If I had not been up with the lark and made all the butter betimes sich a vinegar-cruetâ\\x80\\x99s countenance would turn all the cream to the dairy worse than a thunder planet. Safe to know something is up ; but donâ\\x80\\x99t ye tell us what the misfortune is till yer have broke yer fast. So now, Fannee, my dear, tâ\\x80\\x99 back kitchen and tell Mar Teazer tâ\\x80\\x99 bring maisterâ\\x80\\x99s rasher and taties â\\x80\\x99t once.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Fannee,â\\x80\\x99 as her aunt, Mrs Bullen, called her; â\\x80\\x98 Fanner,â\\x80\\x99as her uncle, Anthony Bullen, pronounced itâ\\x80\\x94harder like ; but he was never hard or stiff with she, â\\x80\\x98 Miss Fanny Uglow,â\\x80\\x99 for he was mighty proud of her, and took up with her, and he delight in all her fun and May games. A year or two back she had been a proper romp and tom-boy ; out with Maister all day driving his gig, or on her pony ; but they had sent her to school, to a boarding- school, at Plymouth to learn â\\x80\\x98 Deportment,â\\x80\\x99 and she had come back handsomer than ever, and with a finish in manners and deportment. She had manners ! Miss Fanny Uglow was sisterâ\\x80\\x99s child to Maister ; he had nor chick nor24 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP child of his own, so he reared Miss Fanny instead ; and she, being the eldest of sixteen, â\\x80\\x99twas useful to Capâ\\x80\\x99en and Missus Uglow that Miss Fanny was provided for like by her Uncle Anthony to Tredinnick Farm. Miss Fanny was fine and comely, with hair as black as the rocks with the moon behind them, and eyes true-blue, cheeks like poppies and cream, a sma-al and innocent mouth ; but for all the straight eyes and innocent mouth she had the wickedest pair of black eyebrows ; they used to lift up and down like the ears of a hunter pricked up, with a toss of her head, for she was proper spirit-ty. I mind what she had on that fine morning, iith July 1818. â\\x80\\x99Twas a buff-coloured gown, and all about speckled with brown spots or heath flowers like. â\\x80\\x99Twas the freshest cotton gown ; and all about her neck and arms was gathered goffered frills, as Mar Teazer took delight in to bedeck Miss Fanny in â\\x80\\x98 bouffers and goffers, and frill- de-dills,â\\x80\\x99 as she said, â\\x80\\x98 Fine feathers make fine birds.â\\x80\\x99 But that is only partly true with women ; you must have a fine figure to hang it on, and a gracious countenance, and thenWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 25 you have a brave Cornish maid, the likes to be seen nowheres. As Missus Bullen spoke Miss Fanny pushed back her chair, and, standing, she was the best- built woman in all our great parish of Vogue, and she says,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Yes, Aunt Jinnifer, Maria Teazer has had uncleâ\\x80\\x99s breakfast hot a long time, ready for him.â\\x80\\x99 Mar Teazer, for short, she was called, but proper becalled her christenâ\\x80\\x99d name â\\x80\\x98 Thomazine Maria Hannah Teazer,â\\x80\\x99 came in from the back kitchen into the front-hall kitchen where we were, with two plates pan 172 caked together. As they were scalding hot, she was a-holding of â\\x80\\x99em in her white appurn, for Mar Teazer was the cleanest woman to any farm about. Missus used to say, â\\x80\\x98You could see through her she was that clean.â\\x80\\x99 Else she werenâ\\x80\\x99t high favoured in looks. She seemed to have been fashioned in a hurrisome way, for one eye was cocked up in her forehead, and the other was down in her cheek, as if they would not run in double harness anyways. Her mouth and her nose had a twist, some said she made20 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP a face when the wind changed, and so it became a wry face ever after. And her voice was best company to her face, for it was an unsartin cymbal, as a bass viol with a learner, when to listener unprepared ye hears a screech on the strings, or down double bass, and no serious part either to play deadly. Mar Teazer placed her two arms with the plates over Maisterâ\\x80\\x99s head. Maister had fine broad shoulders, but Mar Teazer had a fine stretch with her arms, though she were very stump like and wore pattens summer and winter. â\\x80\\x98 In winter,â\\x80\\x99 she say, â\\x80\\x98 to keep her feet dry, in summer â\\x80\\x99tis best purchase to handle a broom by.â\\x80\\x99 And she wore â\\x80\\x98 a gook â\\x80\\x99 (sun bonnet) summer and winter. Some say â\\x80\\x98 Mar Teazer do live in pattens and gook; must go to bed in â\\x80\\x99em Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking!â\\x80\\x99 Only on the Sabbath day she did not wear pattens and gook after ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock, but a best bunnet and shoes and white stockens. She did car an umberâ\\x80\\x99ll, as she say, â\\x80\\x98safe-ways.â\\x80\\x99 In Cornwall we wants a shower every day for the land, and two on Sundays not to hinder labour, but it do drain away pretty quick down the hills.

Seemâ\\x80\\x99d to me after, that bit of Boyâ\\x80\\x99s-love was prophecy of what was for to come. Now Mar Teazer turned to Missus Bullen and said, both hands high above her head,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Tis misfortune! Missus! a poor job, a wisht poor job !

No ge-at open, either! no fence down! no gap ! no more than a hare could creep ee throughâ\\x80\\x94but there, the whole flock was gone!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, Maister, cheer up heart !

He was jokish and pleasant enough ; but if ye did tantalise he, you suffered for it sooner or later.

Mr Jack Pencoose sat down. He only looked at Miss Fanny, who took precious little notice of him in return. He spoke rough ; not much of a gentleman in his voice. â\\x80\\x98 Na, thank yo-oh ; I have breakfasted, but a glass of beer would not come amiss.â\\x80\\x99 Mar Teazer went to fetch it. He said, speaking to Missus Bullen, but looking at Miss Fanny,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98A great calamity befell my dear Ma yester 172 night,â\\x80\\x99 and then he choked away with laughter.3 8 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP â\\x80\\x98 My Ma went to dine with the Penroses. She went with old Joe, driving in the gig. â\\x80\\x99Twas a proper late dinner, four oâ\\x80\\x99clock\\'; quite fashionable ; and she had on her purple velvet gown, and such a bandbox lashed on to the splash-board to hold her ostrich plumes and turban. Well, they went all right, but, coming home, you know what a thunder shower there was. It didnâ\\x80\\x99t clear till nearly ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and, coming back by Scawswater Mill, you cross the streamâ\\x80\\x94no bridgeâ\\x80\\x94and â\\x80\\x99twas that swollen with the flood that it knocked dear Ma and Joe clean out oâ\\x80\\x99 the gig. The old grey went over on her sideâ\\x80\\x94a mercy she had not been drownedâ\\x80\\x94but she kicked herself clear of the gig and scrambled up the river bank.â\\x80\\x99 Then Mr Jack Pencoose indulged in such fits of laughter as he come to what he thought the funny part of the story that he could not go on for a minute or two. Miss Fanny only looked high and mighty, but she would not laugh ; only she was waiting to hear the story, as she did not love Madam Pencoose that was certain.WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 39 â\\x80\\x98Well, my Ma went sailing down the river, a bundle of purple velvet, and the mighty band 172 box a-dashing after her. â\\x80\\x98 Poor Joe, clinging to the old moorâ\\x80\\x99s (roots), shouted,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Missus ! Missus ! Stop ye, Missus, or ye will be in the mill-dam ! Tom Grugglar ! Tom Grugglar ! turn your dam on ! â\\x80\\x94 turn yer dam off! the Missus is being washed in. Oh, Missus ! Sheâ\\x80\\x99ll shoot over the mill-wheel t Tom Grugglar ! stop â\\x80\\x99ee ! stop â\\x80\\x99ee Missus ! â\\x80\\x9d But down the stream went dear Ma and her band 172 box. â\\x80\\x98Joe seeâ\\x80\\x99d a light in the mill, and Tom Grugglar heard his shouts, and turnâ\\x80\\x99d off the mill-stream in the nick of time.â\\x80\\x99 Missus Bullen said severe-like,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 I hope Madame Pencoose was not the worst for such a distressful accident ? â\\x80\\x99 Miss Fanny said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 How nice it must be to have such an affec 172 tionate son as Mr Johnnie Pencoose ! â\\x80\\x99 This remark seemed to sober him a bit in his laughter, so he said gruffly,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Well, if she were really the worse for it,40 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP I should not tell ye the story to make ye laugh.â\\x80\\x99 Maister had laughed hearty, for he was always partial to Mr Johnnie, and he said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98No, no, my lad! we did not thinkâ\\x80\\x94if it had been anything more than a duckingâ\\x80\\x94that youâ\\x80\\x99d make merry over it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And what became of the bandbox,â\\x80\\x99 said Missus. â\\x80\\x98Gone straight out to sea â\\x80\\x94 the French fashion gone to its own coastsâ\\x80\\x94I reckon.â\\x80\\x99 Miss Fanny got up and went into the gar 172 den, and she had her laugh out behind the laurel hedge. After a bit, through the laurel hedge, she caught sight of Mr Johnnie Pencooseâ\\x80\\x99s top- boots, and she flew like lightning awayâ\\x80\\x94she hate Mr Johnnie and his rough ways.

So Miss Fanny went away quick that after 172 noon, with her fine Leghorn hat, her swing 172 ing pace, her head in the air, carrying all the top-knot high. And off she goes to the sea, but she must needs pass over the Downs Park of Trovogue House, and round in front of the great salt-water pool ; all the downs covered with short grass turf ; for forty feet deep there was nothing but sand, and the turf was in hillocks, like the waves of the seaâ\\x80\\x94but the sea was near a quarter mile away.

A beautiful, fine bow, and the Frenchman said to Miss Fanny,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Ah ! charming mademoiselle ! my sweet English rose ! has she been a little desolate at my enforced absence? To me it has been des-es-pair! Has Mademoiselle FannÃ© been sad ? I have rested broken-heartâ\\x80\\x99d,â\\x80\\x99 bowing low. â\\x80\\x98No, not at all, Mons Juste. Why should I be sad ? I have been as glad as a bird ! â\\x80\\x99 laughed Miss Fanny ; and yet she liked to hear of the desolate des-es-pair of Mossoo Marc. He was a handsome, smart man, for a foreigner, in his blue silk coat. He spoke fair English, but he had a mincing voice ; and though he laughed as if light of heart, an ugly look would come into his face. At times he showed too much white of eye, as a wicked horse, would kick from sheer devilment alone. But Miss 4546 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP Fanny only saw his gay and polite manners, which was very different from Mr Johnnie Pencoose, and not vulgar and familiar as Samuel Stock, the lawyerâ\\x80\\x99s clerk. Miss Fanny was as straightforward as any girl could be ; for they all like a little secrets and mysteries, as â\\x80\\x99tis in the nature of girls. She meant, every time she met him, to tell her Aunt Jin-ni-fer; but it had passed on, and she had not. She thought her Uncle Anthony would be very angry for her to speak or com 172 panion at all with \\' that Frenchman ! â\\x80\\x99 as Water 172 loo had not been long fought, and most had a spite and hate to Frenchmen. Miss Fanny forgot to think of her uncleâ\\x80\\x99s displeasure at her meeting the Frenchman ; and she forgot all about the lost sheep, and they chat full lively together. Mons Marc told her more about himself than he had ever done beforeâ\\x80\\x94how he was French on his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s side, but Irish on his motherâ\\x80\\x99s. He told her he had an Irish pro 172 perty, which he hoped the feet of his divine angel, enchanting Mademoiselle FannÃ©, would tread as her own. Miss Fannyâ\\x80\\x99s heart beat wildly, but she said calmly,â\\x80\\x94WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 47 â\\x80\\x98 Where is this property ? What part of Ire 172 land?â\\x80\\x99 He said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 I do not dare, I must not tell you ! I dare not ! my life is at stake until things are more settled there. I am not able to show myself in Ireland ; I am forced to be in hiding, but, perhaps, only for a few months. I have been hunted like a mad dog ! â\\x80\\x99 1 1 think you are safe here,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Fanny; â\\x80\\x98there is only one Irishman, and he lives at Trevogue, as you knowâ\\x80\\x94Dick Sweeny.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes ; Sweeny is my mate and trusted friend. He is the cook, I only pretend ; but Lord Respry knows all about it, and it is at his advice I take the situation of cook. Wait, oh ! stay, enchanting Mademoiselle FannÃ©. I pour out my heart at your feet ! â\\x80\\x99 Miss Fanny leant against the rough trunk of a Scotch fir, and faced Mons Marc; but with her parachute she marked idly, as she listened, a half circle in the sandy dust, as if Mons Marc was to stay outside that charmed circle. When she had finished she looked8 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP him in the face with her true-blue eyes, though the colour in her face showed it took some courage to meet the gaze of her lover. Of course I cannot tell you all that passed between them, and I cannot give you all his Frenchy talk as I give the Cornish tongue. I can make one of our old Vogue parish speak plain enough. Mons Marc, when he dressâ\\x80\\x99d in his cookâ\\x80\\x99s dress, all white, and cap to match, he always looked as if he was acting, which he was ; the only natural thing about him seemed the knife in his belt, and the way he would draw his shoulder up, and place his hand upon the handle, which, for his figure and appear 172 ance, should have been a sword or a dirk more than a cookâ\\x80\\x99s knife. However, he was not dressâ\\x80\\x99d this evening like a cook, except he had the knife in his belt, but over it a smart, dark-blue coat, yellow waistcoat and shirt frillâ\\x80\\x94the French fashion of the day. Mons Marc flew very high colours in pass 172 ing complimentsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98she was adorable,â\\x80\\x99 and a parcel of high-sounding words, which, as we ainâ\\x80\\x99t in love, looks foolish ; but Miss Fanny, with all her spirity ways andWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 49 high-head carrying, was a real shy Cornish maiden, so she half thought she ought not to listen, and was frightenâ\\x80\\x99d, and yet it was new and flattering, so she looked demure, and made a second half circle in front of her. He wanted her to promise a great deal. Would she meet him to-morrow evening? No, certainly not; she had only come on business of her uncleâ\\x80\\x99s to the top of the hill and back. She would now wish him good-evening. 1 Would she allow him to call on her uncle, and explain his circumstances?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, cer 172 tainly not. Mons Marc, we are different. I am not in your rank of life, though you pass as a cook here. I am, I see, as much beneath you in rank as you would have been beneath me if you had been a real cook.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You are beautiful and good, fit to marry a prince. Will you allow me the honour to pay my respects to your uncle, and explain to him some of my difficulties ? I may be free to 172 morrow, may I come and see your uncle ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, not for the world ; but I will speak to my aunt that I have met you, she knows that I was introduced to you by Miss Pencoose,5Â° IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP and I wish you to let me pass, sir, our acquaint 172 ance must cease.â\\x80\\x99 She was getting frightenâ\\x80\\x99d. It was the short cut through the wood, two hundred yards from the public road. She said to herself she had not thought to meet Mons Marc ; but had she rather not hoped it when she went in front of Trevogue to go to the old pound, a long way round ? â\\x80\\x98Will you allow me, Mons Juste, to pass?â\\x80\\x99 He stood between her and the gate of the fir plantation that led out into the road. â\\x80\\x98 My heart kneels for pity, adorable one ; may I kiss your hand before we part. I am ever at your service.â\\x80\\x99 She was rather frightened at his fierce pas 172 sionate bearing, so she said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 I have some business Mons Juste for my uncle, please let me pass ? â\\x80\\x99 He bowed ; he may not have done it ; allowed her to pass or been moved by her entreaties ; but his quick ear heard a horse trotting down the hill, so he moved aside, but as she passed he took her hand and kissed the dimpled knuckles, half covered with the lace ruff.WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 51 Miss Fanny caught her hand away, and seemed to lose her presence of mind. With a sort of hurry scream she ran towards the gate. A thick choking voice,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Miss Fanny Uglow, is this fellow pestering you ? If he is Iâ\\x80\\x99ll break every bone in his body.â\\x80\\x99 A young, scowling, red face peered over the gate of the plantation, leaning from his horse, with one hand on the gate and a formidable hunting crop in his hand. It was Mr Johnnie Pencoose. Miss Fanny recovered herself ; in fact, she felt much safer now and could be brave ; at the same time she was not a bit grateful to Mr Johnnie Pencoose for coming upon her talking to the Frenchman, so she said, proud,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Thank you, Mr Pencoose, when I require your help Iâ\\x80\\x99ll ask for it, and I think you are rather impertinent. Mons Juste, at all events is a friend of your sisterâ\\x80\\x99s, as she introduced me.â\\x80\\x99 Mr Johnnie Pencoose muttered a passionate oath. The Frenchman laughed.52 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP â\\x80\\x98 Pardon the young barbarian, Miss Fanny, John Bullâ\\x80\\x99s bull dog puppy.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98By Jove! you white-livered scoundrel, you frog-eating Frenchman, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll teach you to call me names ! â\\x80\\x99 The Frenchmanâ\\x80\\x99s eye gleamed, and his hand went to his knife. â\\x80\\x98 Yes, you butcher-cook, you coward ! â\\x80\\x99 roared with much noise Mr Johnnie Pencoose. Miss Fanny passed the horse and rider, into the middle of the road. â\\x80\\x98Yes, stay there, Fanny, or better run home, while I settle him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Johnnie, donâ\\x80\\x99t, donâ\\x80\\x99t ! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll never forgive you ! It is disgraceful! Think of me! Do not quarrel on my account ! â\\x80\\x99 She thought it would be murder, and Miss Fannyâ\\x80\\x99s pride had flown away with the two angry men facing each other. â\\x80\\x98 Do not be alarmed, Miss Fanny ; I shall not quarrel with the young fool,â\\x80\\x99 said Mons Marc, as he waved his hat in the air. But the contempt was too much for Mr Johnnie Pencoose; so he raised his whip and cut the Frenchman across the shoulder.WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 53 In one second the Frenchman was on the gate, a-level with Mr Johnnie, with his knife in the air, and it was in the fleshy part of his arm before he swerved his horse. Howling with rage and pain, Mr Johnnie had him by the throat. In a minute the Frenchman was on the ground, the Englishman off his horse on top of him. Mr Johnnie had got the knife; in one moment more he would have stabbed the Frenchman to the heart. But a cleverer fencer than either had hold of Mr Johnnieâ\\x80\\x99s wrist, uplifted with the knife. It was the old Lord Respry separate the two men, the French and the English. Mr Johnnie never could tell much what happened, as he got faint from loss of blood. But he heard, just as he was going off, the the old Lord say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Baron , this is unpardonable, fighting with my neighbours ! If anything like this happens again you must leave Trevogue.â\\x80\\x99 And then he heard them jabber in French, and Mr Johnnie had swooned away.54 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP Miss Fanny ran nearly all the way home. She saw Lord Respry separate her fighting lovers, and was thankful he did not see her ; and so ran home. She was only stopped close to Tredinnick by her uncle shouting,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Fanner! Fanner, my lamb! have ye seeâ\\x80\\x99d â\\x80\\x99em? FI ave ye seeâ\\x80\\x99dâ\\x80\\x99em ? you be running so quick ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Seen what, Uncle Anthony?â\\x80\\x99 she panted. She had seen enough, surely, for one arter- noon. Then remembering,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 No, Uncle Anthony; nothing of the sheep. I did not get so far as the pound. I want to get back to Aunt Jinnifer; I promised to tie down the jams this evening.â\\x80\\x99 But Miss Fanny could not make up her mind to say anything about the adventure to her aunt, Missus Bullen, â\\x80\\x98 about these tiresome fighting men.â\\x80\\x99 She wondered if Mr Johnnie Pencoose was much hurt. He was a great, rough fellow ; and, after all, why should he interfere ? She always showed she hated him, and he knew it was no good. She wished he would get married, or go away, or something.MMk : Billy Pearce was there and heard every word.VITH OLD VOGUE FO. â\\x80¢:*r the Frenchman, . i : did it was coward]v â\\x80\\x98 use a . \\' never speak to him mam. evenings after-Miss ; anny â\\x80\\x99/as c arden gathering gooseberries when e ? 1 ar Teazer after a bit, ^ she e ; : gs to public-â\\x80\\x99oose, Miss I my, I: johnnie Pencoose has been havmg . says he will be tfie deal ; ] /a â\\x80¢ an yet.

It was cowardly to use a knife. She would never speak to him again. A few evenings after Miss Fanny was out in the garden gathering gooseberries, when out came Mar Teazer after a bit, and she began,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Fine riggs to public-â\\x80\\x99oose, Miss Fanny. Young Mr Johnnie Pencoose has been having rows, as he says he will be the death of that fine Frenchman yet. And the Frenchman say â\\x80\\x9c he will creep and creep till he get his heartâ\\x80\\x99s blood ! â\\x80\\x9d But, of course, he is too fine that Frenchman to frequent the public-â\\x80\\x99oose; but Dick Sweeney do answer that he said it. My dear life ! I say â\\x80\\x99twill be murder. Mr Johnnie have all but murdered he ; and the French 172 man stabbed he ; he is slinged to the arm ! Billy Pearce was there, and heard every word.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, Mar Teazer, donâ\\x80\\x99t tell me about public-house gossip. I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to hear anything of it. It is most disgraceful of Mr Johnnie Pencoose. Such an example ! What would his mother, Madame Pencoose, say?â\\x80\\x9958 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP And yet all this gossip was uncomfortable for Miss Fanny. â\\x80\\x98 Well, my dear Miss Fanny, I only tell ye, mind ye, becas I are certain sure you be the in- nercent means of the whole bisness. They are all crazed and mazed about you, my beautyâ\\x80\\x94 the propperest beauty as ever was seen in this parish! No one ever come a-courting I, but it must be fine to be courted.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Come, Maria Teazer, please leave those tiresome men alone. I do not want to hear anything about them. What does Bill Pearce say about the lost flock of sheep? Has he heard anything of them ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, nor never will, Miss, till somebody â\\x80\\x99suit Johnny Hooper, the wise man of Ladock. Maister will never hear tell of them if he donâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, Mar Teazer, how foolish you are!â\\x80\\x99 laughed Miss Fanny. â\\x80\\x98 Fancy consulting a wizard to know where the lost flock of sheep is ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am no more foolish than was King Saul.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, never mind King Saul,â\\x80\\x99 said MissWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 59 Fanny, impatient-ways. â\\x80\\x98 The world is older now. I am sure we have a-picked enough.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Mar Teazer, â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99twill make a brave pie.â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER IV. While Miss Fanny was so took up in thoughts of her sweethearts, poor Maister Bullen could not sleep oâ\\x80\\x99 nights, nor teal his eye all night, or if he did, he would dream and â\\x80\\x98 cry aloud in his dreams,â\\x80\\x99 as pious Bunyan says. How wisht and spirited dismal it do sound. â\\x80\\x98 And me thinks I crieth, and none to answer in my dreams.â\\x80\\x99 So Maister call out, â\\x80\\x98 They be a- coming, they be a-coming ! They be a-al a- flocking down right agen me ! The devil doth drive them ! â\\x80\\x99 So crazed and mazed was he in his sleep, and he was wisht and gloom-mer waking. At last Missus Bullen was fairly worrâ\\x80\\x99d out. She were differ from Maister ; she were as one oâ\\x80\\x99 Pharoahâ\\x80\\x99s lean kine, as a-swallerâ\\x80\\x99d up everything, seeming the more she swallerâ\\x80\\x99d the 60WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 61 thinner she wor. But she were a kind Missus, tu â\\x80\\x94 a proper steer-a-course woman. Some callâ\\x80\\x99d her near, and miser ; she ruled her life on these lines. â\\x80\\x98 Waste not, want not.â\\x80\\x99 She no wasted herself, nor let anybody else waste. She loved work, and she could not abide the lazy, and the slattern had a poor time with she; but for all that she had a tinder heart for the afflicted in sickness and the aged, and many was the poor sols as could sit a bit and bide a bit by her chimbly corner to warm theirselves, poor sols, with a drop oâ\\x80\\x99 hotted cider and a crib (crusties as you do call â\\x80\\x99em up country). Says Missus,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Co ! co ! Anthony, man, have yer mind at peace, and send up to Johnny Hooper, the wise man of Ladock, and he will tell ye where the flock oâ\\x80\\x99 sheep be tu, so yer mind will be to rest and aisey, so yer can â\\x80\\x99tend to bisness agen.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Come, now, Jinnifer, donâ\\x80\\x99t ye be so fulish as to think I are going to â\\x80\\x99suit Johnny Hooper. How do he know more nor I do about the lost sheep?â\\x80\\x99 says Maister, obstinate like ; but Missus, as the ways of women, did neâ\\x80\\x99r give up or give62 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP in easy. As I did tell ye, it were known to I, but most did say â\\x80\\x99twerenâ\\x80\\x99t so, but I never noised it abroad that Missus was Capâ\\x80\\x99en of Maister; lor, quite Capâ\\x80\\x99en she wore though he be the biggest Cornish man alive. So she say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t believe in Johnny Hooper? What next, I wonders ! Why, even the parson, Dr Tregonpol, go to consult Johnny Hooper when his property is missing.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Parson Tregonpol go to consult Johnny Hooper! Oh, no, no, Jinnifer, not parson; not he ! â\\x80\\x99 says Maister Bullen, â\\x80\\x98 as who should know the parsonâ\\x80\\x99s ways and mind better than his churchwarden.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, if not Parson Tregonpol, his house 172 keeperâ\\x80\\x94Mrs Brokenshear. Sheâ\\x80\\x99suited Johnny Hooper when the parsonâ\\x80\\x99s tayspoons was stolen. She have entertained I with that story often, Mrs Brokenshear. It was come about like thisâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x99Twas Mael-mas, the green-goose time. She send up a nice harish goose to Mr John Hooper â\\x80\\x99long with the message,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Parson Tregonpolâ\\x80\\x99s tayspoons is stolen.â\\x80\\x9dWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 63 â\\x80\\x98Johnny Hooper made answer,â\\x80\\x94 * â\\x80\\x9c The man who stole the parsonâ\\x80\\x99s tayspoons come Christmas Eve his head shall veer round the wrong way, and back is front to he for ever after if he donâ\\x80\\x99t take \\'ee back they tayspoons afore time mentioned.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 So, afore Christmas Eve, when Mrs Broken- shear gets up to open the Rectory front door, there was all the twelve tayspoons laid out neat on the front-door step. So Parson Tregonpol, coming home a few evenings after from a run with harriers, he a met Johnny Hooper the wizard or wise man of Ladock, in Ladock Wood. â\\x80\\x98Says Parson Tregonpol, taking off his hat perlite like, as his custom always is,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c So, Mr John Hooper, I do hear thee are consulted as a wise man.â\\x80\\x9d If so, Dr Tregonpol, â\\x80\\x99tis more than I ever heard tell you was.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Thee hast a shrewd wit, but thy impudence is greater,â\\x80\\x9d laughed Dr Tregonpol. â\\x80\\x9cGood- evening.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cGood-evening, Dr. Tregonpol, I stops a lect-shure jist in time.â\\x80\\x9d6 4 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP â\\x80\\x98 Now, Maister, you may be as lucky as parson over his tayspoons.â\\x80\\x99 So at last Missus wheedled over Maister, and he goes out to Bill Pearce, who was young un then, and he says to him,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Ride away to Ladock, to Mr John Hooperâ\\x80\\x99s, and take this ten-shillinâ\\x80\\x99 bit and say to him,â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c Maister Anthony Bullenâ\\x80\\x99s compli 172 ments of Tredinnick Farm to Mr John Hooper, and he have lost a flock oâ\\x80\\x99 sheep, and will ye please for to tell un where the sheep be tu ? â\\x80\\x99 Bill put on his best fustian coat and green glass buttons and a steeple hat, for a proper beau was Bill in those days, and he rode away on Vilet, the strawberry mare. I have oft and oft listed to that tale of Bill Pearceâ\\x80\\x99s and his ride out to Johnny Hooperâ\\x80\\x99s, and all that befel he, so Iâ\\x80\\x99ll give it in his own tongue, â\\x80\\x99xactly as he do speak it. It was high morning, the sixth of August 18IS, when Bill did ride forth from Tredinnick Farm, and â\\x80\\x99twas high by day before he got to Maister Hooperâ\\x80\\x99s house, the wise man of Ladock. Now Maister Hooper was one oâ\\x80\\x99 they mor-WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 65 tals as loves to live lonesome like ; no servant, no one to do for he. Yet they did go for to say he could call up a parcel of company to di- vart his self with, sich as hob-gob-lins familiar spirits. â\\x80\\x99Twas wisht things they said of he,â\\x80\\x94 he sleep all day, at night he went a-hunting ; and fine wicked sport, tuâ\\x80\\x94that was what some say. Others say, â\\x80\\x98 No sich thing, heâ\\x80\\x99s a-harm- less as anybody else.â\\x80\\x99 The tale was told of many a poor traveller as lost his way on the moors would hear a horn blow â\\x80\\x98sich an unearthly screech.â\\x80\\x99 They would say it made the heart thump up quick time, and then yer flesh would creep goosey-ways all over ; then he would listen and hear the baying of the yeth houndsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99tis a most ghastly hunt as ever was seen, and we do know who the hunts 172 men is as hunts the poor shadders out of this worldâ\\x80\\x94the moon would burst out and they would leap away down an old mine shaft. They did say Johnny Hooper rid well to the yeth hounds, shouting and tearing along by the side of the devil huntsman they rid neck-a-neck ; but Johnnyâ\\x80\\x99s horse always threwâ\\x80\\x99d he on the brink of the press-ee-piece of the old mine shaft,66 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP and old Johnny would get up and totter away home, his sport over for that there night. Still it was Mr Hooperâ\\x80\\x99s enemies who told these stories, for so powerful a wise man was sure to have plenty of enemies. â\\x80\\x99Tis a savage country out on the moors. â\\x80\\x99Twas a desolate dwelling the wizardâ\\x80\\x99s lone house on the old Cornish moors.

Now all these solemn tales Mar Teazer had told Bill the night before, as she said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 I reckon youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to go to â\\x80\\x99suit the wise man of Ladock to-morrow as ever is.â\\x80\\x99 So Bill Pearce had to take Dutch courage on board, and stop at every Kiddle-le-wink be 172 tween this and Ladock ; so with a Dutchmanâ\\x80\\x99s courage, Bill werenâ\\x80\\x99t afraid at all, â\\x80\\x99tall ; and when Bill came before the wizardâ\\x80\\x99s door, he knacked and knacked ever so loud, a-holloa- ing ever so loud, as if he were driving bullocks. At last Bill sees a yaller cotton night-cap, with a tassel tâ\\x80\\x99 the end of it, looking right at un, only a thin chin underneath, a-stretched out from the champer winder up steers ; a voice, all be-witched like, clear and high, cry out,â\\x80\\x94 1 Who be theer ? Who be theer ? â\\x80\\x99 Bill fell all of a trimble, â\\x80\\x99twas that misery voice. So Billâ\\x80\\x99s voice went high into the quavers as he said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Tis only Bill Pearce from Tredinnick.70 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP Mr Anthony Bullens, who sends his love to ye, Maister Johnny Hooper, and he â\\x80\\x99ave lost a flock oâ\\x80\\x99 sheep ; lost right away, and you is counted a wise man, will you let I know where the sheep be tu ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, Silly Billy, that ainâ\\x80\\x99t no news!

But you might have knacked big Bill down with a goose feather when it come upon he, that that ioth of July, as ever was, the flock of sheep was amissing ; so Bill shiver and shake as he says,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Now I knaw for sure thee is no saint, maister, so thee is acquaint with the other party, be sure ! â\\x80\\x99 Now Bill had fits of tirnour ; then he grewâ\\x80\\x99d perlite as he say then to all seasons â\\x80\\x99tis best to keep a civil tongue in yer head ; then he would say, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m a Dutchman if I donâ\\x80\\x99t say what I have a mind to say,â\\x80\\x99 so he called out,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98You proper auld scoundrel, tell I quick! where my maisterâ\\x80\\x99s sheep be tu !

He was proper dumber-founded, he say aloud,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 The cock-a-eye, and standeth on wires pattens, and nigh byâ\\x80\\x94Mar Teazer to life.â\\x80\\x99 The auld Johnny Hooper laughed and laughed ; diverted his self fine, and he say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Take this yere message home to yer maister, the Fat Bull of Bashan ; he wont like the looks of the black sheep as he will meet some day in a narrer place.â\\x80\\x99 He roared this out at poor Bill â\\x80\\x99nuff to make the bravest man turn chicken-hearted. Bill was fairly frightenâ\\x80\\x99d, so he put up his most wheedlesome voice, and he lipped out,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Good Maister Johnny Hooper, the friend D72 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP to the poor man, if, be sure, a terror to the rich, will ye plaise for to tell where the sheep be tu ? If yer will let us knaw, what somedever the folks do say agenâ\\x80\\x99 ye, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll count ye a true wise man.â\\x80\\x99 * Where the sheep be tu ? Time will make mention,â\\x80\\x99 says Maister Hooper, and he slams the champer winder tight home.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Lack-a-daisy ; me ! â\\x80\\x99 says Bill to his self ; â\\x80\\x98 I have heerd tell afore now he was a proper auld termagant, but saftly I has it, I did not mention the ten-shillinâ\\x80\\x99 bit, the prize to know the secret.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Maister Hooper! Maister Hooper,â\\x80\\x99 roars Billy. â\\x80\\x98Time will make mention, but money makes the most mention. And Maister Bullen have givâ\\x80\\x99d me here a ten-shillinâ\\x80\\x99 bit if ye will plaise for to tell where the sheep be ?â\\x80\\x99 No answer. The winder home closed as if no mortal lived inside. Bill ca-aland ca-alled ever so, and threwâ\\x80\\x99d up gravel, and Viâ\\x80\\x99let, whether it were the familiar sperets all about, began to neigh and cut pretty capers, as Bill said,WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 73 â\\x80\\x98 Thereâ\\x80\\x99s much more nor a horse can see nor we, after a good feed oâ\\x80\\x99 corn ; â\\x80\\x99 but there was many a mile twixt she and her manger. So Bill could no sit she ; she jumped sky high ; with her buck jumps she sent Bill flying over her head. He jump up, and he catches she round the neck and whisper, coaxing her,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 I see him, old girl. I see him, old girl. Quiet now.â\\x80\\x99 She was all in a lather with fright, a-snorting the life out of her ; but when Bill whispered, â\\x80\\x98 I see him, old girl,â\\x80\\x99 she quieted down a bit. After all this dover, Bill, as near bewitched as Viâ\\x80\\x99let, he sat down on an old moor-stone (granite) to cool hisself, with the bridle hitched under his arm. He gave forth one more bellow, â\\x80\\x98 Maister Hooper! what shall I do by the ten shillinâ\\x80\\x99 bit ? What shall I do by it ? â\\x80\\x99 At last, as Bill was going to ride away, the champer winder banged open, and a wisht voice ca-alled, clear and high,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Did anybody speak ? Who be theer ? Who be theer ? â\\x80\\x99 All dazed, mazed, and dement was the voice, so Billy tells the whole story over agen.74 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP Says Johnny Hooper,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Did yer mention a ten shillinâ\\x80\\x99 bit, my good lad?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Iss, iss, sure, Maister, here it be, only tell yer humble servant where the flock oâ\\x80\\x99 sheep be tu ? â\\x80\\x99 Says Johnny Wiseman,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Put the ten shillinâ\\x80\\x99 bit on top of the garden postee.â\\x80\\x99 So Bill puts it on the top of the garden postee, and he could just reach it from Vilet. Then Bill sees the ten shillinâ\\x80\\x99 bit twinkle and a-twinkle, glimmer like a live thing, and then go right out, and he never seeâ\\x80\\x99d that there ten shillinâ\\x80\\x99 bit agen, never no more ! Now mark me, never no more! Then Johnny Hooper was moved to roar like a lion from forth â\\x80\\x99neath the yellow night-cap ; â\\x80\\x99twas awful like, the tassel, though high by day,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Tell yer Maister, he of Bashan, to get up afore the sun on the morning of the fifthtinth of August, and tell un to walk up his town place (farmyard) and up Crooked Lane, and he will see his sheep coming home right agen him, drove home by a black sheep.â\\x80\\x99 Bill says,â\\x80\\x94â\\x96\\xa0 â\\x80\\x9c Viâ\\x80\\x99let she were more plagued-like than the Christian.â\\x80\\x99WITH O LB Vi . .koe, Maister : \\' .

Long life to â\\x80\\x99ee, maister,â\\x80\\x99 jeered Bill, and he turned Viâ\\x80\\x99let and rode home over the moors. But he suffer for those jeers, and was plagued prettily. All the ways home he heard a screechy, pea-cock-etty voice up in the sky, mocking-like,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Go home, silly Billy ! Go home, silly Billy ! â\\x80\\x99 He could see nathingâ\\x80\\x94nathing but an auld gull overhead, larger than lifer ; and the gull flied on overhead till yer come to Fair Cross, screeching to the sound,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Go home, silly Billy ! Go home, silly Billy ! â\\x80\\x99 So poor Bill was daft and mazed and crazed with the screeching and the flopping wings overhead ; and as for the poor dumb creetur, Viâ\\x80\\x99let, she were more plagued-like than the Christian. I may say, it damped she all over ; and Bill tried to say his grace â\\x80\\x99fore and after meals backwards and forwards ! He wished he could have called up a longer prayer, the ten78 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP commandments ; but he was in that bother he disrem-em-berâ\\x80\\x99d them all-together. When the auld gull seeâ\\x80\\x99d the cross by the wayside, he droppâ\\x80\\x99d torment, and he circled higher and higher in the blue sky till he werenâ\\x80\\x99t no bigger than a linnet. Missus and Maister sit up late for Bill Pearce that night ; and â\\x80\\x99twas ten gone past afore Bill come to Tredennick ; and then he would never have come and rendered it, but for Woolly Woollaton, for he had been piskay laden ; that was sure. Woolly had to convoy un, and prop he up to tell his tale, right agen the parlour- door to answer questions. When he seeâ\\x80\\x99d the Missus by side oâ\\x80\\x99 Maister, that seemâ\\x80\\x99d like to sober un a bit, and he say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Missus, I have been fine and pestered and torment ! with the sperets of the air, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll search no wise man out ever agen. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll leave- the evil ones to their selves ; you only come half-crazed out of sich en 172 counters ! The wicked speret of the wisht, auld Johnny Wiseman, come down flopping on my poor head; he â\\x80\\x99sumed the shape of a gull ! â\\x80\\x99WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 79 Says Missus, tart-like,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Please to mind yerself, Bill Pearce. I should think you was gullâ\\x80\\x99d.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98How many kiddle-â\\x80\\x99e-winks ? â\\x80\\x99 said Maister. â\\x80\\x98 How many did you stop at ? Keeping the good strawberry mare out this time oâ\\x80\\x99 night ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I could no help it, Maister ; us could no find the ge-atâ\\x80\\x94neither she nor me ! We rid rounder and rounder the Barn Meadow ; and, for the life of I, the piskays blind I so as us could not see the ge-at,â\\x80\\x99 stammered poor Bill. Says Missus, sharp,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Oh, nonsense, Bill Pearce! â\\x80\\x99Tis the cider, not the piskays ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Now, Maister, look ye here! If it were the cider, how come it that Viâ\\x80\\x99let did not ride straight to ge-at ? She ainâ\\x80\\x99t took no cider; she were â\\x80\\x99wildered more nor I. Us go round and round in the middle of the Barn Meadow, as the merry-go-rounds to a show fair; and if the auld Woolly Wool-la-ton had not a-callâ\\x80\\x99d out and a-broke the spell, as he shout,â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c What be a-doing of, Bill Pearce ? A-riding that mare of Maisterâ\\x80\\x99s, a-circling her8o IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP round and round ? â\\x80\\x9d and he broke the spell, as we was plskay-laden, sure ; and us would have rid and rid the circle till sunrise, when the pis- kays go home.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Now,â\\x80\\x99 says Maister, â\\x80\\x98hold thee peace, Bill Pearce, and tell away a-me-di-jetly. What mes 172 sage from the wise man, Mr Johnny Hooper, about the flock oâ\\x80\\x99 sheep ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, Maister, sometime the auld termagant roared as if he was driving a team of yoked ox, and sometime he hist lipped like er anger goose, but the sense of it, Maister, was this here,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c On the morning of the fifthtinth of August you is to rise before the sun. You is to walk up throâ\\x80\\x99 the town place, and you is to walk up Crooked Lane, and at the rising of the sun you will see the flock coming home right agen you, drove home by a black sheep.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x99 Maister laughed. â\\x80\\x98 I reckon that do pourtray Mr Johnny Hooper. No blacker black sheep ever was. However, I ainâ\\x80\\x99t quite such a fool as to do what he tell me.â\\x80\\x99 But as I did it whisper, though I should notWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 81 like to go for to noise it abroad, Missus was Capâ\\x80\\x99en of Maister, as it seems the more manlier the more they give up to wermen. â\\x80\\x99Tis only yer whip-sparrows as are a-fear of a laugh, as are proper wives tyrants, keep the purse, and end miser-like. So Mr Anthony made a show to differ, but the end was the same. â\\x80\\x98 Obsarve yer own mind, Jinnifer, observe yer own mind.â\\x80\\x99 Whisht ! she did, tu ! So she say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Come Anthony, man, we have gone to lay out a ten shillinâ\\x80\\x99 bit, and horse and man all day ; we must bide by what the wise man say.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x99Tis childish, Jinnifer, proper childish. Iâ\\x80\\x99m shamâ\\x80\\x99d to think I sent up to Ladock ; and I have laughed at my men. â\\x80\\x99Tis worse sooper-tish-un ; we ought to know better.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, Maister, â\\x80\\x99twill be waste now, if you leave it bide, and waste is more to be shamâ\\x80\\x99d on than fulishness or sooper-tish-un,â\\x80\\x99 says Missus, convincing like. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Taint no great hardship to rise at sunrise in August month ; so you may as well wend your way82 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP up Crooked Lane for an airing before break 172 fast. Shall ye go, Anthony ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Time will make mention,â\\x80\\x9d as the old fule said,â\\x80\\x99 says Maister.CHAPTER V. The next morning Miss Fanny was a-sitting out under the lime-tree in the front garden, with Missus a-shelling peas. Miss Fanny, having sighed many times, â\\x80\\x99nuff to blow the peas out their pods, Missus say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Fannee, dear life, donâ\\x80\\x99t go for to sigh so, â\\x80\\x99tis calculated you lose a drop of blood out of your heart every time ye sigh. What have ye got to sigh about, child ? â\\x80\\x99 Miss Fanny did not answer to once, but, after a bit, she said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Aunt Jinnifer, you are handsome now, you must have been still handsomer when a girl. Did you have manyâ\\x80\\x94many sweet 172 hearts ? â\\x80\\x99 Missus look up keen. 838 4 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP â\\x80\\x98 Oh, â\\x80\\x99tis come to that, is it, child. What age are you, Fannee ? It donâ\\x80\\x99t seem so long since sister Uglow asked Anthony and I to stand gossips to your christening.â\\x80\\x99 Miss Fanny,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 I was eighteen last May ; but do not let us talk of that. Would you, Aunt Jinnifer, mind telling me your experience as a girl withâ\\x80\\x94withâ\\x80\\x94lovers ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 As a guide-book, do you mean, Fannee ? But if I rake up the old sillinesses, â\\x80\\x99tis in vain, for the fashion changes with courting, so what will fit one generation wonâ\\x80\\x99t another.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, but, Aunt Jinnifer, would you only just tell me how many sweethearts you had, and how you liked them ? â\\x80\\x99 beseeched Miss Fanny. â\\x80\\x98Well, there was first when I was seventeen, my cousin, Captain Walter Wonce.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Captain Wonce!â\\x80\\x99 cried Miss Fanny, and she burst out laughing. Missus joined hearty tu as she took a hand 172 ful more peas out of the trug on the grass plat and shellâ\\x80\\x99d them into the bowl. â\\x80\\x98 Yes, Fannee, Captain Wonce was wishingWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 35 to make me his fourth ! He was my motherâ\\x80\\x99s cousin ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And I suppose he had a red tow wig then, Aunt Jinnifer, as now?â\\x80\\x99 laughed Miss Fanny. â\\x80\\x98Yes, thirty years have not changed that, nor put grey hairs into it, you may make sure ! he have changed little, though past eighty, as Anthony do say once a man get the dry shrivel he do become mummy-like, and changeth little.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, Aunt Jinnifer, he is the very ugliest little man I ever saw ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, he is bright of eye, which tells the quick wit, more pleasing in a man than good looks, and, Fannee, donâ\\x80\\x99t put too much store by looks, it soon goes, and we are as we were made ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh no, Aunt Jinnifer, not the tow wig ; but there, please go onâ\\x80\\x94how interesting!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Captain Wonce was then the first miner above ground, but he is richer now than he was then ; still he had a smart house down to Camborne, five serving men in red plush, a carriage and two post-boys to ride to London, and he was hand-and-glove with every gentle-86 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP man in the county, respected for his honesty, thoâ\\x80\\x99 he was shrewâ\\x80\\x99d of wit in bisness. Now, I have heard father tell the tale. There was a lot of London gentlemen come down to start a mine, and they wanted to have Captain Wonceâ\\x80\\x99s opinion in favour of the mine, so they asked un to make a report ; he said he would put no report in writing, but he would inspect it and would give a report in words to the committee. So the day come, and a fine dinner was spread, and after dinner the London gentlemen made fine speeches on the old Cor 172 nish mineral wealth. â\\x80\\x9cFish, Tin and Copperâ\\x80\\x9d was toasted as usual, and then they call on Captain Walter Wonce for his report on â\\x80\\x9c Wheal New London.â\\x80\\x9d Captain Walter Wonce rose solemn, his speech was ever terse-like, he say,â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c Where â\\x80\\x99tis ! There â\\x80\\x99tis ! â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x99 Miss Fanny laughed. â\\x80\\x98But, Aunt Jinnifer, do tell me more; how could he have proposed to you? Fie had had three wives, and you were only seventeen. Flow did he dare to propose ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The head that can schemey best in the whole country, did not go fumbling much inWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 87 courtship. I remember the day he came ; mother had put decanters and cake on the table, for he told father at Redruth Fair the day before he was going to make a call on mother. So I had on my best bib and tucker, though I did not know what was coming ; so I was in a twitter expecting to see the fine carriage and post-boys with two footmen standing be 172 hind. Father kept out of the way. I often thought after, father knew what he was a-com- ing about, as there was a twinkle to his eye ; but mother, she did not see anything. I callâ\\x80\\x99d to mother, and we went out to the porch. He had only come with Richard, his man, in his gig after all ; but mother welcomâ\\x80\\x99d him. After a bit she said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cJinnifer and I was a-hoping, Cousin Walter Wonce, you was a-coming in your fine equipment, post-boys and serving men.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9cWould it ha pleased Miss Jinnifer, there, more, if I had come in state ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 And he looked at me out of the corner of his eye as he cracked a nut with his sharp teeth. He said he always used Adamâ\\x80\\x99s nut 172 crackers and Eveâ\\x80\\x99s sugar-tongs. He never88 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP could put his fingers into the bows of a sugar- tongs. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9cSure it would have plaised us both,â\\x80\\x9d said mother. â\\x80\\x9c â\\x80\\x98 Would you like an equipment of your own, Miss Jinnifer, and ride to London?â\\x80\\x9d says Captain Wonce, sly-like. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Mighty ! â\\x80\\x9d says I. â\\x80\\x98 Says he,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Tis to be had in three letters.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Is it a riddle ? â\\x80\\x9d says I. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c No,â\\x80\\x99 says he ; â\\x80\\x98 I never spake in riddles, and I canâ\\x80\\x99t beat about the bush, thoâ\\x80\\x99 you may flush a shy bird a bit too soon, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t beat about the bush. I risk that.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then he cracked away a few more filberts, and drank a glass of sherry wine. â\\x80\\x98 We was standing up, mother and I, looking at him, thinking he was going to say something important, but never guessed what. When he had finished he looked at mother. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Cousin Tabitha Runnalls, I like your darter, Jinnifer. She is young, but she looks straight-minded, as she is outward made. She ainâ\\x80\\x99t no giggler, and she ainâ\\x80\\x99t no lisper ; sichWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 89 gals I canâ\\x80\\x99t abide ; so I offer her my hand ; â\\x80\\x9d and he thumped it on the table, making the decanters jump together. â\\x80\\x98 Mother was taken aback, so she muttered,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cVery handsome of you, Captain Wonce, very handsome; but Jinnifer must speak for herself.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cWhat does the gal say?â\\x80\\x9d says Captain Wonce, looking at me, a bit paler than was his wont. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c I will not beat about the bush either, sir. My answer is in two lettersâ\\x80\\x94No. All the same, I thank you for the honour.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Good Aunt Jinnifer, tell me about the others, please.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then two or three came about. One was a Quaker; his name was James Pye, a che-mist. They used to call him Jay Pye. But he was a very formal young man, and there was beating about the bush with Friend Jay Pye.â\\x80\\x99 (A jay is called a jay pie). â\\x80\\x98 Then I met your Uncle Anthony, and when first I saw him I never thought I should have him. However, I did, and got the best man this side of London.â\\x80\\x99 E90 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP â\\x80\\x98 But, Aunt Jinnifer, did you ever like any 172 oneâ\\x80\\x94that no one else liked ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, dear. They ainâ\\x80\\x99t often pleasant people. The worldâ\\x80\\x99s sampling may be wrong, but it is often true samples, after all.â\\x80\\x99 Then they were silent ever so long, aunt and niece ; and Miss Fanny looked as fresh as the daisies on the lawn, with her white drawn hat, her blue gown, and pretty wave hair, and her shapely neck. The bees flew about over the high box-edging ; â\\x80\\x99twas a full beauty summer day. Through the arch of the old stone gateway you could see the public road, and across to the orchard. Someone passed and lifted his hat with much flourish,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Aunt Jinnifer,â\\x80\\x99 says Miss Fanny, â\\x80\\x98that is, Mons Marc Justeâ\\x80\\x94theâ\\x80\\x94theâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 She could not say the word â\\x80\\x98cook,â\\x80\\x99 it seemâ\\x80\\x99d so ridiculous with such a fine gentleman. â\\x80\\x98 You know he is living at Trevogue, a French refugee.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh Fannee, my dear ! you have not, dear life, taken up with that frog-eating Frenchman? How did you come to know him ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember, Aunt Jinnifer, whenWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 91 I went by coach to Falmouth with Sally Pencoose, he rode by the coach, and we said, for all he looked a highway man. And Sally introduce me, and you know how rude Johnnie Pencoose was to him ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes, I remember, Miss Sally Pencoose is wild, and for all they hold themselves higher than we, they do not keep themselves up with those they should be stiff with ; I never like your going with Miss Sally over much.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I like Sallv the best of them all, Madame is silly and vain, and Jinny is too flighty, the Squire is very dull, and his son is rough, and more stupid than allâ\\x80\\x94a very bad temper.â\\x80\\x99 1 He is only a bad temper if he is roused. Your uncle always says he has a lot of solid sense. â\\x80\\x98 Too solid ever to be any good to himself or anyone else ; it will never flow out, he is as heavy as lead.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, Fannee, there is worse going! How 172 ever, we will drop him, for here is Mar Teazer come for to carry away the pea shreds to the pigâ\\x80\\x99s bucket. Now, Fannee, my dear girl,92 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP promise me not to meet that Frenchman with 172 out my knowledge, or your uncleâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to speak to him again.â\\x80\\x99 Then Miss Fanny up and told her aunt all about the fight between Mons Marc Juste and Mr Johnnie Pencoose.CHAPTER VI. Now, Maister Anthony Bullen went early to rest on the night of the fourtinth of August 1818, not but what he often rose with the sun, still â\\x80\\x99twas harvest time that year and working late you ainâ\\x80\\x99t so early, and he had said to Missus at supper,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99Tis a sight as brings forcible-like the Old Testament, the reaping of corn and the women a-binding sheaves after the men ; and the gleaning, the women donâ\\x80\\x99t seem so handy as when I were young. Then there was Aunt Kattern Broad, there was Betsey Reel, Peggy Dawe ; dear ! how active and smart they were. Half-a-manâ\\x80\\x99s work they could do easy, and fourpence to sixpence a day wage, hardy and cheerful they was. Barley-bread built up their constitutions, gave â\\x80\\x99em health, strength, grit and courage, seeming 9394 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP meâ\\x80\\x94to me I never see such roody counten 172 ances now as then. I remind when I was a boy, the old parson, before Dr Tregonpol, Dr Sladdacott, D.D. He was a book-worm (wrote a Latin history of Cornish church land). Well, he was a crippler with rheu 172 matics, so he used to be carried out into the harvest field, where the most men oâ\\x80\\x99 the parish did congregate, and he would have all his ancient books to read, and a big stick with a fine knob to it ; and he would be a-reading, and the men would go work 172 ing on, and forget parson was nigh by, and perhaps a thoughtless one would use swear language, up went the parsonâ\\x80\\x99s stick in a whirl round his head, and, with a true mark, he heaved right at the swearerâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder, aâ\\x80\\x99maist knocked him down. After that, all day they would only chirp like chicken ; no swear heard in that field. When I was a little chap I often fetched his stick back for un, and he used to say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Anthony, my little man, â\\x80\\x99tis better I should strike that man than he should go on and provoke the Almighty to strike him dead.â\\x80\\x9dWITH OLD VOGUE FOI.K. 95 â\\x80\\x98 Now, I do say, that was a forcible lesson not to be forgot ; now, some do say, you canâ\\x80\\x99t make the men â\\x80\\x99tend to ye without swearing loud at â\\x80\\x99em ; now, thinking of Dr Sladdacott, I have never done it. I have got on as well as any manâ\\x80\\x94cheerfuller service no man ever had, better ; I may say hearty service.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99Tis an interesting tale,â\\x80\\x99 says Missus ; â\\x80\\x98 but if Dr Sladdercott had lived to these here days he would have been had up for â\\x80\\x99salt and battery. â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Donâ\\x80\\x99t think they would be so cowardly as not to take the parsonâ\\x80\\x99s drubbing in a proper spirit when they had done wrong.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, Anthony! You are simple, old- fashioned.\\' â\\x80\\x98 Glad I be, if â\\x80\\x99tis manlier ! â\\x80\\x99 Then Maister went to bed, and he often used to look out for a sign, a simple sign, to make up his mind by ; so, as he turned down the long stone passage in the twi 172 light, he says to hisself,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98As I go up steers, if I see the doves out on the dove-cot roof, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go up Crooked96 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP Lane by sunrise as ever is. If I donâ\\x80\\x99t see â\\x80\\x99em, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x99 Now from the long steercase window you could see over the back kitchen yard, into the farmyard, and as the Maister looked out to view, he saw the doves come home for night and lit on the dove-cot wall, real by name callâ\\x80\\x99d the â\\x80\\x98 Culver House,â\\x80\\x99 the most ancientest thing, Dr Tregonpole say, in all Tredinnick was that Culver House. â\\x80\\x99Twas a great, round tower, with pigeon-holes in side like a well, to get into ; and you could not get in or out but by fetching a long ladder. When you got a-top the wall, you pulled up the ladder and drop it down inside, so you see â\\x80\\x99twas built so it werenâ\\x80\\x99t easy to rob the Culver House. One day Bill Pearce was missing ever so long. They hunt for un ; at last Missus say, I told Bill Pearce to bring in some young squabs for a squab pie, so they went to the Culver House, shout round the tower, no ladder to be seen ; at last they heard a voice inside the tower, moaning,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Lack-a-daisy me, I is most done for, as IWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 97 was a-placing the ladder inside I pitchee away on my poor head.â\\x80\\x99 So they went and got an 172 other ladder and got un out, and he werenâ\\x80\\x99t no more of a poor Isaac than he was before, for pictching away on his head. Isaacs, as we do call they, who are not â\\x80\\x99zactly fitty, or as some do say, half-baked, â\\x80\\x98 put in with the bread and taken out with the cakes â\\x80\\x99 ; so when the morn 172 ing of the fiftinth of August come, Maister waked with the lark. He goes creepy down the back steers, so he shaâ\\x80\\x99nâ\\x80\\x99t wake Miss Fanny and the maids ; he ainâ\\x80\\x99t feared to wake Bill Pearce as he do pass his door, for Bill do sleep like the seven sleepers. You might drash un, and you might drag un, but no mortal could wake Bill before his hour (which were five oâ\\x80\\x99clock rig-gular), for Bill sleep heavy-like. So all in the fresh morning air, Maister Anthony Bullen walks up his town place, he whistle for Ship in the barn, Ship run on a bit in front of he, and he look up, with aâ\\x80\\x99most human gaze, as if he could say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99Tis critic time, Maister.â\\x80\\x99 They go up Crooked Lane together, and9 8 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP Maister sees the great red sun rise out of the blue morning summer sea, like a fine mangold wurzel cut in half. Maister looked over the ge-at at the splendour. He heard moo-sick, beau-ti-ful moo-sick, the bleating, bla-ting of a flock oâ\\x80\\x99 sheep. And, Oh, be joyful ! he sees all they blessed sheep a - flocking doon right agen him. And he looked, and he gazed stark. What was that a - driving the flock home? His heart felt like a cold pertater in his mouth, for there was a monstri-ous black sheep a- driving the flock home. Maister looked at that black sheep till he was aâ\\x80\\x99most ready to drop. Maister Bullen, the strongest Cornishman as ever pullâ\\x80\\x99d off his coat to wrastle, had no more heart left in un, than a sparrowâ\\x80\\x94a chick sparrow. Maister often said, I wish there had a- been a eye witness more nor me, to have seeâ\\x80\\x99d that black sheep ; but the only other witness was the poor dumb one. Poor Ship, when he saw the sheep he guv a bark forâ\\x96\\xa0 . . â\\x96\\xa0 >1I :~y > O V ? , ; v-///-\\' Mais? â\\x96\\xa0 ? red ar rise out of th- f â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80¢ nni sea, like a fine â\\x96\\xa0â\\x96\\xa0 4 ,- n half.

Poor Shipâ\\x80\\x94 his first and last fitâ\\x80\\x94poor Ship, Maister grieve prettily for that dog, it prettily grieved he. He says after,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 What was it killâ\\x80\\x99d my trusty Ship, my poor dog? â\\x80\\x99Twas either the mys-te-ri-ous black sheep or joy ; the flock had come home, â\\x80\\x99twas one or the tâ\\x80\\x99other that broke his poor heart?â\\x80\\x99 Now the mon-stri-ous black sheep bolts round double quick, and took the hedge at a leap, and Maister saw him go across country like a di vil or a deer, right over the hedges and ditches, right over the moors, up to Laddock.â\\x80\\x99 And Maister say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Now, what was that black sheep ? Was that the divil or Johnny Wiseman ? For see that black sheep I sartainly didâ\\x80\\x94and I may say â\\x80\\x99twas no ordinary mortal of a black sheep. What was it ? â\\x80\\x99 But Missus Bullen would say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Hish ! Hush tu ye! Anthony, man, co ! As102 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP. we a-got all they blessed sheep back home that was lostâ\\x80\\x94and yer did not waste the ten shilling bit either, we must not enquire too much as to the means.â\\x80\\x99 Maister then say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 True, true, Jinnifer, thee at least has spoken well. Thee at least is a wise woman.â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER VII. Now, Maister was so proud and pleased he got the flock oâ\\x80\\x99 sheep home, that he say to Miss Fanny,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Fanner, my lamb. We will have a trait to cele-brate this home come of the flock. When the neck is cut we will have a souper, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have the barn cleared out, and ye shall have a dance if ye have a mind.â\\x80\\x99 Miss Fanny was prettily pleased, and she said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 A dance ! Oh, Uncle Anthony, what a lark ; v I will write the invites at once.â\\x80\\x99 Then Missus and Miss Fanny was much sur 172 prised as the Maister said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Well, Fanner, do ; and ye shall write one for me ; â\\x80\\x99tis this :â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Mr Anthony Bullenâ\\x80\\x99s compliments, and as 103104 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP he is going to give a trait on the,24th of August, he would be honoured by the company of Mr Marc Juste.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x99 Missus looked at Miss Fanny ; but she was playing with the new puppy to be reared in the place of Ship, so she did not look up. Missus said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 How did ye come to know him, Maister ? â\\x80\\x99 1 Well, â\\x80\\x99tis a longish story ; but you know the strawberry mare, Viâ\\x80\\x99let, have taken to bolt and shy ever sin Bill Pearce and she got piskay laden, as he do say, or maybe she were frightenâ\\x80\\x99d by her visit to Johnny Hooperâ\\x80\\x99s. Well, I was a-riding she along, and there was a man sitting on the bank with a rumberella a- taking pick-shores of the auld cottages, and so Viâ\\x80\\x99let shied so quick, took me unprepared ways, and I was in the ditch. The gentleman (for he is that) was very sorry he a-had a-been so occupied he did not see me to lower the rumberella. I said â\\x80\\x9cIt were only a tumble,â\\x80\\x9d and he catched Viâ\\x80\\x99let for me. I liked his pick- shore, and he said he would walk over with it as a present. Then we conversed ; he said he was partly French. I asked un whether heWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 105 had ever seen Bonny, and he said, â\\x80\\x9c Scores of of times, and Josephine too.â\\x80\\x9d He says he is a greater general than Wellington, and if heâ\\x80\\x99d only been an admiral like Nelson he would have scrunched England up. I say, they can laugh who win. No manâ\\x80\\x99s life is long enough to be a general and an admiral tooâ\\x80\\x94they both want the best years of short life for â\\x80\\x99prentice-shipâ\\x80\\x94so we got on brave, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have another dialogue with he, if I can. â\\x80\\x9cAs iron sharpeneth iron,â\\x80\\x9d so is French and English. â\\x80\\x98 I find he is house-steward to Trevogue, but he talked too high for that, so I did not make him out. However, I told him who I was. He said, being so big, he guessed who I were! So, now, Fanner, I wish to invite he, now we are going to give a trait.â\\x80\\x99 Miss Fannyâ\\x80\\x99s heart beat fast, if one could judge by the rose petals that flushed her cheek, and then turnâ\\x80\\x99d lilly white. So Maister turns to me. 1 Now, clerk, you must beat up the â\\x80\\x99Quire to come and tunee up a bit.â\\x80\\x99 So great preparations for a fine trait wereio6 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP to be made. Miss Fanny wrote her in 172 vites. â\\x80\\x98 I suppose, Aunt Jin-ni-fer, we must invite Madame Pencoose ? not that she will come.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 We must pass the compliment, Fannee. Miss Sally and Miss Jinny will come, and, of course, Johnnie we have not seen for a long time ; his arm is still stiff. I wonder Maister have not heard about it. If he knew of that fight they had, he would not be asking of them together.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, donâ\\x80\\x99t tell uncle, please, Aunt Jin- nifer ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, I promised not, and Johnnie is going off on his larks with that boat of his soon. I wonders if Madame Pencoose will come, just to show her smuggled silks, satins and laces. Of course Johnnie Pencoose did not say it when he relate the tale of his ma, in purple velvet, being nigh swept into the mill dam ; but I doubt not â\\x80\\x99twas smuggled, turban and all ! â\\x80\\x99Tis the fashion to smuggle ; but I always hold a Justice of the Peace should not break the law of the land, or wink at his family doing so ; nor parsonsâ\\x80¢ V 4 CORA\\'ISH T 71 to be made.

But Dr Tregonpol have always been sturdy against smuggling.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 He has not got any wife or daughter to dress in silks and lace,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Fanny, laughing. â\\x80\\x98 Well, he is very partial to snuff, and I am sure he would not take a pinch, if he were dying for it, if he thought it were smuggled.â\\x80\\x99 Maister come in at this, and he laughed. â\\x80\\x98Well, Jinnifer, how is it that the parson likes taking a pinch from Squire Pencooseâ\\x80\\x99s snuff-box? He must know â\\x80\\x99tis too good not to be smuggled ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Mr Churchwarden ! â\\x80\\x99 laughed Miss Fanny, â\\x80\\x98 donâ\\x80\\x99t tell tales.â\\x80\\x99 Well, the arter-noon came for crying the neck, which is an insti-too-tion peculiar to Cornwall ; no one do know â\\x80\\x99zactly what it means. I do hold it mean the neck of the harvest is broken ! But our school-maister to Vogue, who is oâ\\x80\\x99er learned, he do say, â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99Tis a pagan custom, and the offering is to the goddess Serious.â\\x80\\x99 But I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe there ever were such a goddess, or what have us gotno IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP to do with she ? Sure, our Cornish saints must have swept pagan ways and customs out of Cornwall. Some do go still farther and say, â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Tis a offering to Old Nick!â\\x80\\x99 Now, there is some sense in that. Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go for to tell ye â\\x80\\x99zactly how â\\x80\\x99tis done. First, Miss Fanny had made a lovely neck of corn, with flowers and ribbains, very smart, and plenty harvest flower in it. Then Maister step forward and took the scythe from one of the men, coat off in proper style, the pick-shore of a handsome farmer, as the likes we shall never see again ; he turned, and the last bit of standing corn he mowed down. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s cutting the â\\x80\\x98 neck.â\\x80\\x99 There was a good party in the field. Then Bill Pearce took the neck from Miss Fanny, with an obesiance as Bill knew how to make. And he climbed up the top of a mowie near by (Our country mowieâ\\x80\\x99s we rear out in the fields as it might be catching weather. The mowie is shaped like a giant decanter, its cap was the stopper) so Bill, with one arm clutched round the cap of the mowie, withno IN A CORNISH TOW.\\' . to do -m â\\x80\\x98.ht ?

I have. I have.â\\x80\\x99 Then Woolly Woollaton, who had a good pair of lungs of his own, shouted,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 What â\\x80\\x99ave ye ? What â\\x80\\x99ave ye ? What â\\x80\\x99ave ye.â\\x80\\x99 Bill answered. â\\x80\\x98 A neck. A neck. A neck.â\\x80\\x99 Then the whole field shouts, â\\x80\\x98 Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah,â\\x80\\x99 three times, and long down the valley, over the fields and over the oak copses, down to the sea to Port Lemon, all the men that was working down the valley for other farmers, shouted back, â\\x80\\x98Hurrah.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Maister Bullen to Tredinnick have called (or cried) his neck,â\\x80\\x99 they say to one another. Well then all went into the house to have souper, and â\\x80\\x98 a proper trait â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x99twas, the men in the kitchen, the gentry in the parlour. Miss Sally Pencoose and Miss Jinny, also Mr Johnnie Pencoose, he had his arm still in a sling, and he had paled a bit from the effects, and he certainly did look fine and handsome. He was quieter, and Miss Fannyii4 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP was pleasanter to him. She thought as how twas her doing he got the nasty stab. If she had not been there it would not have been mischief. So souper was right merry, and Mons Marc Juste had not come. Then they went away merry to the barn, and here â\\x80\\x99twas Mr Johnnie Pencoose lost â\\x80\\x99vantage, for he could not dance the leastest bit. He could ride across country, he could shoot, he could handle a boat-sail, anything, anywhere, but he could not dance, so as he was out of it, and could not do it, he effected to dispise dancing. Miss Fanny was a-dancing with his cousin, a young lieutenant in the navy, when arrived on horseback Mons Marc. A mighty fine gentleman, his presence and his bearing was sich, that every body made way for him, though â\\x80\\x99twas crowded round the door by the gazers. He might have been a French prince he was that splendid. Maister went to meet him. Maister Bullen had hearty, straight, simple manners, as be 172 come he well ; but the Frenchman was at home in the Courts of Europe, and heWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. brought all his courtliness into the homely Cornish barn. We country men could see it, much more the ladies. At first he only danced with Miss Sally and Miss Jinny, who, to my mind, looked bedecked without much taste. The church quire was there, two fiddles, one bass viol, three flutes and a cornet. They made a fine crack with the country dances. In the middle arrived the club band, and they was jealous the church quire were performing away. They said, â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Twas lowering their selves, a church quire, to play dance music.â\\x80\\x99 So the club band rushed up a side passage, and the big drum stuck half-way, so they could not get in or out, and they did not want to smash the big drum, so they was in a fix, wrastling with the big drum, and they could not move it. Then Miss Fanny danced with the French 172 man, all crowded to look at them, and you could see Miss Fanny enjoyed herself fine, he was such a good dancer. But Mr Johnnie Pencoose he glowered more and more. Then the Frenchman danced a dance by116 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP himself. Some said â\\x80\\x99twas a French horn 172 pipe, or others said it had a much grander name. So, when the gentry went away for more refreshments, Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom, who was there, had just come off a man-oâ\\x80\\x99- war on leave who hated the very name of French. He had been a prisoner oâ\\x80\\x99 war in France, he said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 That werenâ\\x80\\x99t no hornpipe at all, at all.â\\x80\\x99 Then they called on Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom, to dance a hornpipe, which he did, and a fine clever one, but stiffer than the French 172 manâ\\x80\\x99s dance. Then the gentry returnâ\\x80\\x99d laughing, and Miss Fanny on the Frenchmanâ\\x80\\x99s arm, and off dancing again. Maister begun to think that Miss Fanny had danced enough with the Frenchman ; so as she stopped a bit in the whirl-a-wigg, he says,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Fanner! be ye furtigued ? My lamb! be ye furtigued ? â\\x80\\x99 For the first time in her life she answered her uncle cross. â\\x80\\x98No, uncle; donâ\\x80\\x99t trouble about me. I could dance for ever without being tired.â\\x80\\x99WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 117 â\\x80\\x98 For ever is a long day, Fanner. It ainâ\\x80\\x99t given to dance our lives away ! So just go and see if yer Aunt Jin-ni-fer have the punch ready. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll look in and taste fust. You knowâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cTwo sweet, Two sour, Four strong, Six weak.â\\x80\\x9d thatâ\\x80\\x99s way to make punch.â\\x80\\x99 But when Maister came by the big hunting bowl Missus had made the punch in, Miss Fanny had not been there at all. So Maister fumed. Missus say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, nonsense, Maister. She is only resting a bit in the summer-house.â\\x80\\x99 But Miss Fanny, with rare beauty, spirits and pranks, was like a ewe lamb to Maister, the apple of his eye, and his heart felt sore that he had done wrong to invite that Frenchman. It got mutterâ\\x80\\x99d about after the dance that Mr Johnnie Pencoose would kill that French-118 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP man some day, and all for the love of Miss Fanny. One day Mar Teazer came out into the orchard, and there was at one end a look 172 out summer-house, built with stones and sea- shells, and glass at one end. You looked down the valley right out to sea. Miss Fanny used to sit and read there. When Mar Teazer found her, she say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Madame Pencoose have come wishing to see Missus, or you, Miss. Missus have gone out in the gig with Maister.â\\x80\\x99 Miss Fanny rose slowly and went to see Madame Pencoose. She was very fine ; she was always showy. She made a sweep curtsâ\\x80\\x99y to Miss Fanny. Still, Miss Fannyâ\\x80\\x99s grave and stately curtsâ\\x80\\x99y beat her hollow in â\\x80\\x99suming pride that apes humbleness ; the low curtsâ\\x80\\x99y, the rising, proud heart doth show. â\\x80\\x98 I wish, my good girlâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! pray, do not say goodâ\\x80\\x94anything but that!â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Fanny. â\\x80\\x98 I call\\'d you good, as I know you are good- naturâ\\x80\\x99d,â\\x80\\x99 replied Madame Pencoose.It is better to be plain and straightforward in words,â\\x80\\x9d said .Madame Pencoose.WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 121 â\\x80\\x98 I am sorry you are very much at fault. I have not the least good nature about me.â\\x80\\x99 Madame Pencoose looked foolish as Miss Fanny disclaimed â\\x80\\x98good nature.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is better to be plain and straight forward in words,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame Pencoose. â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Fanny; â\\x80\\x98if language is not used in that instance to conceal your thoughts.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then, to be plain. Of course, you know my son, Mr Johnnnieâ\\x80\\x99 (Madame Pencoose, too late, wished she had not had him chris 172 tened Johnnie! Now she wanted to be proud and stiff) â\\x80\\x98 Pencoose is â\\x80\\x94 is â\\x80\\x94 somewhat in love â\\x80\\x94 with youâ\\x80\\x94Miss Uglowâ\\x80\\x94has he told you so ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Your son is a very gifted individual; so no doubt I should treasure the very poetical words with which he would express his love or admiration, you may think, so pro 172 verbially blind is a motherâ\\x80\\x99s admiration for her son ; but, in truth, it would not bear repeating, any conversation of Mr Johnnie Pencooseâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x99122 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP Madame Pencoose gave up fencing ; so she said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 I wish you to know that it would never be with our consent (my husband, Squire Pencoose, and myself) that our son shouldâ\\x80\\x94 shouldâ\\x80\\x94marry you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You wish me to say I do not aspire to the honour, but, on the contrary, I could not sink so low ; and if the whole family of Pencoose fell on bended knee, and entreated me to form an alliance with such a noble house, I could not do it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You are a disagreeable, haughty girl,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame Pencoose, â\\x80\\x98 and you have not a penny to bless yourself with.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I warned you I was not good-naturâ\\x80\\x99d, and whether the penny you speak of belongs to me or not, it cannot be of the slightest import 172 ance to you after my assurance.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You seem to be a girl not lacking thatâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cassurance,â\\x80\\x9d Good-evening, Miss Uglow.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Good-evening, Mrs Pencoose.â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER VIII. Now, as Maister Bullen had got his flock oâ\\x80\\x99 sheep back in a manner marvel to all Vogue parish, and many parishes round, Johnny Hooper was counted more of a wise man than ever, so he was â\\x80\\x99suited more than ever. There was some who made fun, and said they did not belave in him a bit. For he was credit with some cruel things ; some said â\\x80\\x99twas spite. Johnny Wiseman was well enough if you did not spite him ; if you did, he would spite ye worse back. There was Jan Reel, the son of old Jan Reel, as seeâ\\x80\\x99d the old windlass well and the â\\x80\\x98 Cat-oâ\\x80\\x99-Bell â\\x80\\x99 filled in by Garge and Meary Gait. Jan Reel, this one had a sick cow, tu. They seemed to be onlucky, father and son ; their cattle was always sick and dying. Some said â\\x80\\x99twas their own faults, they was lazy to â\\x80\\x99tend the cattle proper, as 123124 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP wants care ; with care, they reward a man as childers ; they must be reared well to reward. So Jan Reelâ\\x80\\x99s cows began to die, and, after a bit, he began to say, â\\x80\\x98 I be bewitched ; some 172 body have wished me ill. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll find the witch. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go to Johnny Hooperâ\\x80\\x99s, and hear what he have to say.â\\x80\\x99 So he walks over the moors to Johnny Hooperâ\\x80\\x99s. Now, Jan Reel was ever near, and miser-like, so he took nothing in his hand but a crab that had been give to he, and cost him nothing. Johnny Hooper could not abide the mean and stingy, so Jan Reel, if he had been wise, would have taken a duck to make duckee stew, as there was plenty running about in his farm yard. Well, Mr Johnny Hooper was short with the old skin-a-flint, so he say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Jan Reel, yer cattle be ill wishtd, and so will ye, tu, if ye donâ\\x80\\x99t mind. I see what is a- coming on ye. There will be ricks, bonfires â\\x80\\x94ricks make good bonfires. Ah ! see how they blaze in friend Jan Reelâ\\x80\\x99s yard ; that is what I see a-coming on ye. Bonfires ! Theyâ\\x80\\x99ll warm ye, though ye canâ\\x80\\x99t warm no one elseâ\\x80\\x99s hand.â\\x80\\x99Betty Neptune./ \\\\%â\\x96\\xa0 ^ Betti Ni \\\\WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 127 Jan Reel said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Lors, that is worse and worse. Iâ\\x80\\x99m a poor man, and then â\\x80\\x99twill be ruin, Maister Hooper.â\\x80\\x99 Jan Reel were always a plaintive speaker, now he fairly whinâ\\x80\\x99d. Then says Johnny Hooper,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Go home over the moors, and the first auld woman you sees alone, no body by (mind ye, a-al alone, nobody nigh by), sheâ\\x80\\x99ll be the witch has have ill-wishted your cows. You must scratch her with a bunch of brimble, or what you can find. Now I donâ\\x80\\x99t tell ye to hurt her, but, being an old witch, you must draw her blood, and when ye have drawn the witchâ\\x80\\x99s blood, you can sleep comfortable in your bed, as snoog and waarm as bon 172 fires can make ye.â\\x80\\x99 This rough, ignorant old chap goes home over the moors to the top of Mariassic Town. There was a poor old woman, callâ\\x80\\x99d Betty Neptune ; she carried on her shoulders a panier of fish for sale, but now she had sold all her fish, so stayed to pick a few sticks to boil her crock oâ\\x80\\x99 taties and pilchards agen her son Bonny, or Bonnypeart Neptune come in128 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP with his boat. Bonnypeart was a strange, wildish chap ; he was not cliver, but he was strong, and a good son to his mother. Jan Reel walks up step-ee-toe behind Betty Neptune, and rubs a bit of prickly fuzz in her face ; she screech, and banged him with the fish panier. So Jan Reel got two blackee eyes, and the worst of the encounter with Betty Neptune, and she went away home to tell her big son Bonnypeart. He said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 This very night Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be off to Vogue parish, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll wake up that Jan Reel.â\\x80\\x99 And he did, and he set all the ricks ablaze, and then, when Jan Reel came out, he drubbed him fine, as he said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Take that for my mither. Ah, ye shall not treat her rough agen, not if Bonnypeart Neptune know it.â\\x80\\x99 The people round about took agen Johnny Hooper, and said he was â\\x80\\x98citing people to do mischief to one another, and they said Johnny Hooper must mind his self what he was about ; or they would see to it.â\\x80\\x99 And some gentlemen farmers say they wouldWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 129 â\\x80\\x98stop Mr John Hooperâ\\x80\\x99s pranks!â\\x80\\x99 they would have â\\x80\\x98 no more of his pranks ; â\\x80\\x99 so the crafty ones, these gentlemen farmers, said they would unmask Johnny Hooper, and show the foolish people he was no wise man at all, but only a very or-din-nary auld mortal of an im 172 poster, they would test he before the public, and â\\x80\\x94 and they digged a pit-fall for Johnny Wiseman. They was fine and cunning, as you shall presently see. Some farmer had been and trappâ\\x80\\x99d an auld fox ; so the crafty ones, as was a-plotting Mr Johnny Hooperâ\\x80\\x99s downfall, gets hold of the fox â\\x80\\x94 in secret, as â\\x80\\x99tis not many as would like to own as how they had trappâ\\x80\\x99d a fox in the country as is hunted by the best hunt in all England, â\\x80\\x98 The Barrow to the Fore Hunt.â\\x80\\x99 The two-crafty ones, by name, was Mr Tregeagle, the steward to Sir Kit-Kattle, and the other was Mr Trounce, the publican or landlord of Barley Sheaf Inn, to Stickzer Church Town. Mr Tregeagle rode over with the old dead fox under his coat. â\\x80\\x99Twas a mercy for un he did not meet long with the hounds that afternoon, for sure they would130 IN A CORNISH TO WNSHIP have torn he to pieces on the scent of the old fox. When he come in to the inn yard he shout for Mr Trounce, and he do tell the landlord the secret behind the pump, and he showed the old fox, and he said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Do ye think, Mr Trounce, unbeknownest to yer missus and darters, ye could make a pie crustee, and put this here old fox into a pie ? â\\x80\\x99 Says Mr Trounce,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 He have an air with him, that old fox ! He wont be the sweetest cooking ; but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do it. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do it, if I gets up in the middle of the night to â\\x80\\x99eat the oven ! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll cook un in a pie. Yes, thoâ\\x80\\x99 it be a nose-teazing thing to doâ\\x80\\x94and no nose-gayâ\\x80\\x94but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do it.â\\x80\\x99 The next day but one was the court rent day of Sir Kit-Kattleâ\\x80\\x99s, and it was held in the Barley Sheaf Inn. So the company â\\x80\\x99sembled down steers in the sanded parlour of the Barley Sheaf. After a bit the room was choke full, and much buzz over cattle and crops. Mr Trounce opened the door and hollered,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Gentlemun ! Dinner is prounced ! Foller I up steers to the dine parlour ! â\\x80\\x99WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. Mr Tregeagle, as the steward of Sir Kit- Kattle, sits to the bottom of the table, and the pie was brought in all of a smoke! Now, Mr Trounce had baked that pie so un 172 common well, there was only an air of innions about it, so nobody â\\x80\\x99spected what was in that pie ! â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x99Twas a brave pie ! â\\x80\\x99 as Mr Trounce whisper to Mr Tregeagle. â\\x80\\x98 It might have been a lambees tail pie ! It looked innocent enough ! \\' Mr Tregeagle stands up, and he taps the crust with the carvers, and he cleared his pipes to make a speeeh, as some parsons do afore they gives out their textes. Some thing is coming ! as with his eye he sweeps the â\\x80\\x99sembled company, so all eyes are fixed on he with stark stare ; for they all see â\\x80\\x99tis â\\x80\\x99portant what is welling up on Mr Tregeagleâ\\x80\\x99s tongue for speech ; for why should he go for to look so solemn, and balance the carving- knife as if he was a-judging weight, if not so ? Then, having gathered all eyes on himself, he do turn quick sharp on Mr John Hooper, and they follows the lead, and all eyes stare at Mr John Hooper, who have his elbows well G132 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP plant on the table, with knife and fork in hand, ready to fall tu. Mr Tregeagle says,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Gentlemun, and Mr John Hooper in â\\x80\\x99tickler we do all know, up and down throâ\\x80\\x99 Cornwall, the proper powerful wise man. Now, thereâ\\x80\\x99s two meanings to that word, one the common witchcraft meaning, the tâ\\x80\\x99other a son of Solomon. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t go so far as to say Mr John Hooper ainâ\\x80\\x99t a son of Solo 172 mon ; but I do say the folks as consult he in the witch line ainâ\\x80\\x99t, to my mind, sons of Solomon ; but there is some here as do give credit to Mr John Hooper, and that he can see throâ\\x80\\x99 a deal board, two inch thick, the lanscrape beyond, as if that board were only a milky strainer. (Laughter.) â\\x80\\x98It is pleasant, gentlemun, all round. So now, Mr Hooper, in a pleasant way, if you would be pleased to obligee I and company by a-telling me what is in this here pie? As you are counted a wise man, ye can for sure know what this here pie is made of?

Now all was silent, solemn, awaiting, awaiting for the wizardâ\\x80\\x99s answer. Then says Johnny Hooper, says he,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 The old, old fox caught at last.\\' The company did burst their side with laughter when Mr Tregeagle said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Yes, sure, the old fox trappâ\\x80\\x99d and put in a pie.â\\x80\\x99 There was roars of laughter till something less savour come in, and they fell tu like good Cornish trenchermen, as they were. After harvest was well in, and no moon about, â\\x80\\x99twas suspicious time to rin a cargo or two, and the fishermen to Polvogue was good hands at smuggling, every man, woman and child had a hand in it ; and how to dodge the preventive officer and his men was all their bringing up, and the revenue cutter, and as us lanâ\\x80\\x99smen, high up in the parish, we all had a venture, and some136 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP was part owners (or honours as we call^ them). Mr Johnnie Pencoose his self was pretty daring, he had a boat, a cutter riggâ\\x80\\x99d, called the â\\x80\\x98Sea Pink.â\\x80\\x99 She was painted â\\x80\\x98pink,â\\x80\\x99 light, for reasons best known to Mr Johnnie. There was not one born in Vogue that did not know all about the voyages of the â\\x80\\x98 Sea Pink.â\\x80\\x99 She was like a good story - book, for the ventures she went through, and how she rinned, and how she scaped. â\\x80\\x98The â\\x80\\x9cSea Pinkâ\\x80\\x9d is lying off,â\\x80\\x99 or â\\x80\\x98the â\\x80\\x9cSea Pinkâ\\x80\\x9d is in bay, 1 or â\\x80\\x98 she have shown a clear pair of heels to the revenue cutterâ\\x80\\x99s men.â\\x80\\x99 This was all the talks during the season she was afloat. When Madame Pencoose returned to Trenisky, after her call on Miss Fanny, she could not leave well alone, as Miss Fanny had declared nothing would make her wed so low, but Madame Pencoose must up, and tell her son she had interfered. Mr Johnnie was like a mad man, mad with his mother, mad with all, and he says,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98You have ruined me. I donâ\\x80\\x99t care what becomes of me. I\\'ll go to the bad ; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll goWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 137 off in the â\\x80\\x9cSea Pinkâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94no I won\\'t, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do something they shall transport me for, or Iâ\\x80\\x99ll get hanged. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be the death of that FVench- man,â\\x80\\x99 so he raved out. â\\x80\\x99Twas a time they had. The old Squire said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Let the boy bide, and if he have a mind to marry Miss Uglow, let un.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Squire,â\\x80\\x99 says Madame, â\\x80\\x98 sheâ\\x80\\x99s only the daughter of a mine captain, and her uncle is Mr Bullen of Tredinnick; it canâ\\x80\\x99t be.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Why not ? â\\x80\\x99 and for the first time he threw the trade Madame was reared on in her face. â\\x80\\x98 A mine captainâ\\x80\\x99s daughter is as good as a shoemakerâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Or the son of a bal-girl,â\\x80\\x99 said Madame Pencoose leaving the room. The â\\x80\\x98 Sea Pink â\\x80\\x99 was being fitted out for a long voyage, and they said Mr Johnnie Pencoose is off to South America, as Miss Fanny Uglow will not have him. But he called at Tredinnick one afternoon. As luck would have it Mons Marc Juste callâ\\x80\\x99d at the same time, and Miss Sally138 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP Pencoose had come before, and had been a-nutting with Miss Fanny. She had told Miss Sally she had better not come to Tredinnick as Miss Fanny said she did not think her parents liked her coming. But Miss Sally had actual shed tears, and said â\\x80\\x98 she would cling to her friend throâ\\x80\\x99 thick and thin.â\\x80\\x99 If the men who saw Miss Fanny were in love with her the women were more so ; and it takes a fine disposition to rule the hearts of women, and Miss Fanny was of noble heart. The two pretty young ladies are resting on the garden seat, with their long crook sticks by their side, laughing and counting their nuts, Mons Marc on one knee picking up nuts that had fallen. He had been most entertaining, and Miss Fanny was beginning again to think she liked him. Certainly he was a clever man, and the best of company ; and he talked of things that seemed like fairy land, of gay soldiers and beautiful women. â\\x80\\x99Twas spi-cey talk ; even Missus Bullen allow, â\\x80\\x99twas in-ter-es-ting, mighty so. When Mr Johnnie Pencoose ran up theWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 139 stone steps and opened the small garden door with the deep arch and creepers hang 172 ing overhead, the pretty picture inside on the lawn made him glower and curse and swear in his heart, fine ; he was that savage, he would have killâ\\x80\\x99d Mons Marc on the spot. And he said, â\\x80\\x98 I would like to kill him, though I know she wonâ\\x80\\x99t have me either way.â\\x80\\x99 His heart was sore, full of passion ; but Miss Fanny thought â\\x80\\x98 how tiresome of that ill- tempered Johnnie Pencoose to come just now, when it was so pleasant, and we were having an agreeable timeâ\\x80\\x94reallyâ\\x80\\x94I wish he would keep away ; go off in his â\\x80\\x9c Sea Pink,â\\x80\\x9d and never see him again.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How con-trai-er-ry the world of men and women is,â\\x80\\x99 and yet if ever she breaks down and fall in love with him she will have no better time of it than most wives, she had better keep clear and keep her light heart ; sweet dear, with her laughing ways. So Mr Johnnie begun rough to his sister, as if it was her fault all the con-trai-er-ri-ness of life.140 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP â\\x80\\x98 Sally ! Madame and the old gentleman are in a rage at home ; when you drove the pony out you left the gate open, and all the bullocks and pigs are on the front lawn, and one bullock canterâ\\x80\\x99d throâ\\x80\\x99 the new garden frames, and is now kicking about in the forcing pit. You will get it when you get home; they both say you shaâ\\x80\\x99nâ\\x80\\x99t go to uncleâ\\x80\\x99s in London for the Christmas, you will have to stay at home.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe you, Johnnie. I never left the gate open, and how spiteful of them if I did, to say I should not go to London ; â\\x80\\x99 and Miss Sally, who was rather a cry baby, begun to sob. It always cut Miss Fanny to the heart to see anybody cry, and she never seemâ\\x80\\x99d to get used to it, though her friend must have done it often. Miss Fanny started up, and said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98How dare you, Johnnie, make her cry, it is most likely stories, those are the sort of tricks you like to play your mother and sisters, but it is no fun, the roughest horse play. Come, Sally, donâ\\x80\\x99t cry, I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe him, they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t stop your going to London. TheyWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 141 never said it. I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe him,â\\x80\\x99 and her dark blue eyes looked angrily at Mr Johnnie Pencoose. â\\x80\\x98 I daresay you donâ\\x80\\x99t believe me, you never do; but Iâ\\x80\\x99m not the liâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 Mons Marc finished the word with the French and a shrug. Mr Johnnie Pencoose could not contain himself, and grasped his riding whip again as if he would thrash him, and there was a fine bit of playing â\\x80\\x94 acting, only they were not acting, it was all real, at least with Mr Johnnie Pencoose who was too passion 172 ate to see the consequences. Miss Fanny tried her best, but what she said only made it worse, so she took Miss Sally by the arm and said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Dear, we must leave these angery gentlemen.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, how rude Johnnie is, he will never learn manners ; and we were all so happy. Did you ever hear any one talk like Mons Marc, and what a gay and beautiful world he has lived in. Oh, what heavenly place Paris must be. Fancy, if one could get142 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP the chance of getting out of this horrid old Vogue Parish ; if one could only live in Paris ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know, dear,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Fanny ; â\\x80\\x98 you were happy enough nutting just now ; you said it was fun.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, I am so sick of Trenisky and all. I hate this dull place,â\\x80\\x99 cried Miss Sally. Meantime, the two men became more sensible as they became more furious, the sense of cool determined vengeance. They walked down the lane, and no doubt they made some arrangement then to meet elsewhere, and for deadly purpose. A few days after the â\\x80\\x98 Sea Pink â\\x80\\x99 was ready. No one knew whether she was after smuggling or not ; they said she was going to Spain first. Mr Johnnie Pencoose took leave of Maister Bullen, as if he was never coming back again, and the two had a long dis 172 course in the middle of a harrish (stubble) field, it is wise to talk secrets in the middle of a ten-acre field, you can see all round you that no eavesdroppers are nigh by.WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. H3 Poor Mr Johnnie Pencoose did not seem his rollicking self at all when he said good-bye to Missus, and Miss Fanny was callâ\\x80\\x99d down by Maister ; but she set her face as a flint and as cool and handsome as you could see. â\\x80\\x98 How she hates me,â\\x80\\x99 he said, with as deep a groan as any man gave to him 172 self.CHAPTER IX. Now comes a strange tale, and I must give it, as far as I are able, in the word of Lord Respry, as he told the Maister long after, when things got cleared up a bit :â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 I was in my library when my man came to ask for an interview for â\\x80\\x9c Mons Marc,â\\x80\\x9d or, as he was known to me, as young Baron Laraile. I rose to meet him, as he was my equal in birth, though he had been in disguise as the cook in my establishment. I had given him the refuge of my house at the request of a beautiful French lady (round her exquisite grace gathers the romance of my life), so I could but grant her request to give a home to her friend. â\\x80\\x98 It was disagreeable enough to have a 144WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 145 hot-tempered young Frenchman in a very anomalous position in my house ; but it could not be helped, and I had to make the best of it. He began by quarrelling with the son of an old squireen, one of my neighbours, and that was very unpleasant. I cautioned him well over this. â\\x80\\x98 This morning he came into the library with his brows knit, and a handful of letters in his hand. â\\x80\\x98 I was told Baron Laraile was poor ; but he seemed to get money sent him. He bought himself a fine hack, and he was always in the tip-toe of fashion. I warned him the people would talk, it did not suit his cookâ\\x80\\x99s character at all ; but he only laughed. He was a very pleasant fellow, though I often wished him well out of the house. All my English servants hated him. My French valet more than all despised him ; but of course I always cut him short if he began to talk of Baron Laraile. He seemed to delight in calling him â\\x80\\x9c Mons Cook.â\\x80\\x9d The only person in the house who seemed on friendly terms with him was146 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP Sweeny, the real cook ; but I always thought Sweeny a first-rate cook, but a consummate rascal. â\\x80\\x98The Baron began in French,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c I wish, my lord, to go to London, if convenient to you ; but I cannot go with 172 out disguise. I hear, my lord, you are leaving. If you would confer one more favour on me, and allow me to travel as your valet, I should be intensely obliged, and will give you a thousand thanks. From London I hope to go to Germany, where I may settle something, and be able to re 172 turn to my home in the Pyrenees.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c I am glad to hear it, Baron,â\\x80\\x9d I said, greatly relieved at the speedy prospect of getting rid of him, â\\x80\\x9c and I have no objec 172 tion to your travelling as my second valet. Of course I must take Antoine.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 He frowned at this I thought afterwards. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c I am only going as far as Exeter, and then I have to meet an agent between Wey 172 mouth and Exeter.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 Baron Laraileâ\\x80\\x99s face brightened as he said,â\\x80\\x94WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 147 â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98My Lord, the very thing ; I can cross from Weymouth, most likely?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cVery well; what is it to-dayâ\\x80\\x94Tuesday? We will leave on Thursday.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 We bowed and parted. â\\x80\\x98 As we got out of Cornwall we had to face a tremendous snowstorm. I never re 172 member such a storm so early in Novem 172 ber. When we got to Plymouth they said it was impossible for my carriage to get on to Exeter ; it was doubtful if the coach would run. However, I laughed ; with four horses and my post-boys, why should we not do it ? At last we reached Exeter and the very comfortable hotel. I said I would wait a day ; and if my agent did not come on to Exeter, I would not take the carriage. The snow had drifted, so that I thought it was doubtful if we could drive. The Baron proposed our riding to a certain little inn I had spoken of ; and the agent would not be far off, and could well ride there ; and he, Baron Laraile, would push on to Weymouth. â\\x80\\x98 So we three were to ride the next day.148 IN A CORNISH TO WNSHIP The next morning the boots came to in 172 form me my valet Antoine was very ill. Of course I sent for a doctor ; the doctor shook his head, and talked of a â\\x80\\x9c severe chill.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Very severe,â\\x80\\x9d I answered, â\\x80\\x9c seeing he seems quite insensible. I cannot think what can be the matter with him ; he is hardy little French fellow as ever was.â\\x80\\x9d The doctor smiled at my being puzzled, and repeated, â\\x80\\x9c a severe chill.â\\x80\\x9d Then I con 172 sulted the Baron, who seemed full of con 172 cern that poor Antoine was so ill. He thought it would be better for me to remain till Antoine got better and recovered. I never liked to be baulked in anything I have undertaken, and I had promised Lady Respry to meet her at my daughterâ\\x80\\x99s in Wales, so I said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cWell, Baron, do as you like; I shall ride, as I said, to meet my agent.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 He said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Then, my Lord, allow me to go with you ; and when you return to Exeter, I will wish adieu, and go on to Weymouth.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 And so we started. It was a beautifulWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 149 morning as we trotted out of Exeter and left the old walled city and its cathedral behind us. At first it was well enough riding; it was not freezing, and we were on the old coach road that had been cleared of snow ; however, as the day went on, it became overcast and bitterly cold, and we became very silent as riding became more difficult. At last I said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Baron, if we could only read that sign 172 post on the hedge, we should know where we were.â\\x80\\x9d 1 He answered,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c I will do it, my lord ; and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll climb up the hedge, clear it, and strike a light. I have a Spanish allumette.\" â\\x80\\x98We spoke in French, as the Baronâ\\x80\\x99s English was not good. â\\x80¢ I held his horse. He climbed the high hedge with some difficulty ; as the snow had drifted on to it he could get no footing ; but, having reached the top, he climbed up the sign-post, knocked off the snow with his sleeve, and lit the coil or tinder. It struck me, as his dark face was illuminated over150 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP his many brown cloth riding-capes, that the Baronâ\\x80\\x99s was a very evil face, and he looked like a murderous brigand ; and my misgivings about him seemed to take form and shape then and there. â\\x80\\x98 I felt for my saddle or horse pistols, they were not in their leather case. I had always kept them in their cases going any journey, as my father and grandfather had done before, although, of course, it was far safer travelling, in fact one hardly heard of such a thing as highway robbery. I put my hand on the Baronâ\\x80\\x99s saddle. Under a thick greatcoat hung the leather cases, my pistols inside. I quickly transferred them to their own cases. They were loaded I knew, and I had a tin box of caps in my pocket. I had just time to buckle it down as I lent over the horse so as to look undisturbed, when the Baron spelt out, for my translation, the sign-postâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98S-O-R-R-L-E-Y G-R-E-E N.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cAh,â\\x80\\x9d I said with a start, â\\x80\\x9cwe are onlyV * â\\x80¢ â\\x80¢. :â\\x80¢ v-V K* A MURDEROUS RIGAN)ISO /-V A CORNISH TOWN SHU\\' his many brown cloth riding-cap â\\x96\\xa0 . t the Baronâ\\x80\\x99s was a very evil face, and I; )k like murderous brigand, and my n savings him seemed to take form and Ã\\x9b then and there. â\\x80\\x98I teit for my saddle or horse -els they were not in their leather case. had always kept them in their cases , H: dng any journey, as my father and gra.d ,.JH had done before, aiti.ough, of cours; far safer travelling, in fact one hardâ\\x80\\x99 of such a thing as highway robb Ijl put my hand on the Baronâ\\x80\\x99s saddle, a thick greatcoat hung ,the leath . my pistols inside.

Ah, my friend is getting dangerous. A sharp whistle. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c What is that for ? â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Only to wake up the ostler,â\\x80\\x9d I replied. â\\x80\\x98In a few minutes we were in the inn porch, and with the landlord bustled out my old, white-haired agent. I took out my pistols and put them in the deep pockets of my riding coat, and yet it seemed foolish in a little Devonshire inn to be so cautious. We dined together in the little inn parlour, and never seemed a more harmless trio, and, perhaps, I had been rather foolish to suspect him, and, perhaps, it was nothing but the old caution coming up, as with the English army in Spain I had learnt to be somewhat on154 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP the alert. I never knew the Baron could be so pleasant, and he talked his broken English well to please my agent, Mr Sam- bells. At last the Baron rose, wishing us farewell, as, before we were at breakfast, he said he should be on his road to Weymouth. He thanked me profusely for my kindest hospitality and protection. I felt certain now I had wronged him, so I held out my hand, but which he did not seem to see, as he turned to bow to Mr Sambells. â\\x80\\x98 Sambells and myself remained talking some time on business. He had sold a small property for me in the neighbourhood. As we finished Sambells said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c I have, my Lord, the money in gold and notes, as you wished, two thousand three hundred pounds. It is a large sum in cash ; but as you wrote wishing me to meet you here I have done so.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Quite right,â\\x80\\x9d I answered, it was as I desired. I had certain reasons for requiring a sum of money in Wales, where I was going after Exeter. Mr Sambells then askedWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 155 me if I would keep the money, or if he should, till the morning, â\\x80\\x9casâ\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cit is safe enough in this little quiet inn, well known to me.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 I remembered my pistols in my coat pockets, and how I had locked the door, and had the key in my pocketâ\\x80\\x94so my pistols were safe enough, and I told Sambells I would â\\x80\\x9c take the money.â\\x80\\x9d When Sambells handed it over and went off, I remained, as I thought, a half hour ; it was past twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock, the lights, such as they were, were left burning, and I thought some one must be about when I got to my room door, and put the key in it, it would not turn. â\\x80\\x9cHere is a go! Surely some one has been tampering with the lock.â\\x80\\x9d I turned the handle, the door was unlocked. Of course I looked sharply round the room ; it was all right. My pistols were safe in my coat pockets, and I examined them well all right ! I drew the charge, and reloaded ; the room was undisturbed, except some blundering chamber maid had brought in a huge wooden tub half-filled with cold water. â\\x80\\x98 I always had a cold bath summer and156 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP winter, so I suppose Sambells had kindly seen to this ; he knew my habit. I canâ\\x80\\x99t lock the door, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll put the tub against it ; it will be something to do to move that, and my pistols at hand. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll give any thief a warm reception. I placed the money and my watch under the pillow, and put the loaded pistols on a chair close to the bed. Pulling up the blind there would be a glimmer of light in the little room. I fell asleepâ\\x80\\x94at first so tired that I felt indifferent to money or anything else, not so young as I was, worn out with my long rideâ\\x80\\x94a dreamless sleep. Wish! Wash!! what was that? In another minute, before I was awake enough to think, a cold muzzle just on my temple, and a hand under my pillow slowly grasping the watch and money. I lay quite quiet ; it would be death if I moved. My life was of more value than the two thousand or so, and my watch ; I did not move, I felt both my pistols were removed. Lying quiet, as he left the room, I could swear to his height and the collars of his riding-cloak ; it was Baron Laraile. In one instant the scoundrelWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 157 had managed to lock the door. A bell ! No ; the rope had been cut. I kicked and shouted, no answer. I opened the window and shouted â\\x80\\x9cMurderâ\\x80\\x9d as loud as I could. After a time a window was let down across the snowy green, and a shout,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Be ye drunk there or ye sober-wise ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Certainly not drunk. I will give you a sovereign if you get up and call up the people here ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cYou are a gentleman, I sâ\\x80\\x99pose, and as good as your word ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9cYes, come along, you know Mr Sambells, he is my agent.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Then you must be Mr Respry, commonly called Lord ; but I call no man Lord,â\\x80\\x9d shouted back the stout Devonian Puritan. â\\x80\\x98 Of course the Baron was missing, and the stables were empty. My horse and the two or three wretched nags that belonged to the place gone. They strayed home in the day 172 light. Twenty miles out my horse was found shot dead. He must have then got off with the other horse. â\\x80\\x98 A horse may be a vain thing to save a153 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP. man, but two can do it. When I got back to Exeter it was too late. The curious thing was, he was afterwards traced to Weymouth, but, more remarkable still, he got off in Mr Johnnie Pencooseâ\\x80\\x99s yacht, the â\\x80\\x9c Sea Pink.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x99The Sea Pink.) \\' } â\\x96\\xa0 â\\x96\\xa0 * _ . .-. â\\x80¢ .-â\\x96\\xa0 V.: WÃ¿i\".VÂ£--â\\x80\\x99 f 1 \\' \\' â\\x96\\xa0. f The Sea PinkCHAPTER X.

The beautiful â\\x80\\x98 Sea Pink â\\x80\\x99 seemed to have flown right away out of our oceans altogether ; and she was not a-rinning a cargo either. And Squire Pencoose never heard tell of his son. The poor old Squire got very wisht in temper at the loss of his plauge-ee young son, as he said â\\x80\\x9c â\\x80\\x99twas too quiet by half.â\\x80\\x9d And the Squire fell foul of Madame, and said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 If you had not â\\x80\\x99posed the match he would have been with us to this day.â\\x80\\x99 Madame said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Squire, you donâ\\x80\\x99t know anything about it. That proud young chit would not have him.â\\x80\\x99 161162 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe ye ! And he wrapped up in she, worshipping the very ground she trod on ! True love must tell. My poor boy ! â\\x80\\x99 He was getting quite totelish with the loss of his son. And the old gentleman would ride over and talk a good deal with Miss Fanny, bringing her flowers, etc. And Miss Fanny felt for him, and she allowed him to go on talking about his son. He was a proper hero in his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. No one could shoot, hunt or fish like â\\x80\\x98our young fellow Johnnie.â\\x80\\x99 Madame Pencoose took it to heart quite as much Mr Johnnieâ\\x80\\x99s never writing a line to say where he was ; and unknown to his father she advertised a lot :â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Would â\\x80\\x9cSea Pinkâ\\x80\\x9d return to the house of his family.â\\x80\\x99 Miss Fanny herself began to get rather moody - hearted. She had a great shock when her uncle told her Lord Respryâ\\x80\\x99s tale. And Lord Respry had set to work toWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. make inquiries about him, and to try and trace him out, Mons Marc. â\\x80\\x98Fancy,â\\x80\\x99 she said to Miss Jinny, for Miss Sally was wintering to London Town, â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Fancy his being a common thief! To rob and nearly murder Lord Respry, who had shown him so much kindness and hos 172 pitality. And Lord Respry says he must have tampered with his letters to have known he was going to fetch a large sum of money. At all events, he nearly murdered poor Antoine, as he drugged his coffee, no doubt. What a villain and a scoundrel ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, Missus,â\\x80\\x99 says Maister one day, â\\x80\\x98 I have news for ye ! Your cousin, Captain Walter Wonce, is to be High Sheriff next year. Heâ\\x80\\x99s one of the richest men in all Cornwall. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s a letter to invite we to Wheal Fortune Castle ; down near Hay le, ainâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I believe â\\x80\\x99tis a fine place ; but he did and do call it his little breakfast cruets, his pepper castors ; and a salt-cellar in the middle is his style of ar-ti-teck-shore. What do you say, Fannee, my child, for a change,IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP to get the wild roses back into your cheeks, child ?â\\x80\\x99 said Missus, with anxious look at Miss Fanny. â\\x80\\x98 I am not invited,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Fanny. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take care of the house. Do go, Aunt Jin- nifer.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, Fanny; you are asked particularly.â\\x80\\x99 Now, I should like to tell ye about Captain Walter Wonce. How did he make his money ? First they did say he come into notice as a lad of fourteen by the wonderful power he had with the divining-rod. Now, I have never seen a divining-rod, but I have heard â\\x80\\x99tis a hazel-nut in bud, a forkee hazel-nut, and anyone who has the power can hold it in the hollow of his hand without touching it with his fingers. He holds it downwards, and races along ; a pretty race it takes you ! Run you must, and canâ\\x80\\x99t stay yerself. An open shaft and ye will be in it afore you could say â\\x80\\x98 Carn Brea.â\\x80\\x99 Then they tell, before the power comes, you have to shut yourself up in the dark, and take no food ; and after a bit starving and in the dark you canâ\\x80\\x99t sleep, youWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. become fully charged. Then you are let out. You have cut the hazel rod first ; all these days it has been with you. Then this part I have seen â\\x80\\x94 a youth tearing along like a mad boy, all the mine captains a-rushing after him, the boy, with the rod in his hand. Then it begin to shake and jump, and you stand still, and with the rod in your hand, and you are fully charged with whatever it may be. You canâ\\x80\\x99t nowise pass that spot. Lower away ! cut a shaft ; there is mineral there. Now, some do say â\\x80\\x99tis such a mystery they donâ\\x80\\x99t like a-talking of it. Others do say â\\x80\\x99tis nothing but natural, and â\\x80\\x99tis â\\x80\\x98 a power in its infancy.â\\x80\\x99 However, they say it was a sight to see â\\x80\\x99em start. Little Watty Wonce, as he was a-callâ\\x80\\x99d then, let out of the dark cell with no victuals, and some say I tell ye wrong. He first raced to cut his stick, a good forkee hazel-nut, the forks cut off into a wand. Then he would place it in the palm of his hand, and off he would tear, the mine gentry after un, all in black broad-cloth, respectable coats to do business in, but not166 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP to tear across the moors on a hot summer day. â\\x80\\x99Twas a sight to see â\\x80\\x99em start !â\\x80\\x94Watty Wonceâ\\x80\\x99s long hair a-flowing. Perhaps he got the current charge in his hairâ\\x80\\x94it used to stand aâ\\x80\\x99most on endâ\\x80\\x94and that, maybe, when he droppâ\\x80\\x99d the power, he shaved off, and wore a wig. Then, I say, Watty Wonce would come to a dead lock, and the hazel-nut wand or rod would jump and shake in his hand. There was mineral there. I have heard tell little Watty Wonce was dead beat after that, and had proper head 172 aches. Well, that was the beginning of his fortune. After that he was a skemey one, he was, and he used his brains to some purpose. He was, as you may say, â\\x80\\x98 a proper Carnish car-rack-tur,â\\x80\\x99 and no mistake. He used to tell a pretty sight of jokes against himself. â\\x80\\x99Twas all in a dazzling inn to London townâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99twas not callâ\\x80\\x99d â\\x80\\x98 Royal,â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Red Lion,â\\x80\\x99 or â\\x80\\x98 Saladin Head,â\\x80\\x99 but only after the street nigh by was it a-named. â\\x80\\x99Twas bright with glass and glitter, fit for the Lord Mayor to dine to table every day. In come Captain Wonce, our High Sheriff, and sat he downWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 167 to table. They had just gone and put the brath into big silver urn-like thing. Says Captain Wonce to the waiter,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Waiter, I have got a passel oâ\\x80\\x99 silver in my house down by Camborne they do call â\\x80\\x98 Wheal Fortune Cassel â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94a pretty breakfast cruetâ\\x80\\x99s of a cassel it be tooâ\\x80\\x94but that ainâ\\x80\\x99t here or there. But what I say is, I have never seeâ\\x80\\x99d an urn to hold bra-aths in like this here.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yessirâ\\x80\\x94no, sirâ\\x80\\x94indeed, sir ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Now, what do ye, go for to ca-al this here urn to hold bra-aths in ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yessirâ\\x80\\x94please, sirâ\\x80\\x94to hold bra-aths, sir !

We never had a centre piece as a centurion ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x99Tisnâ\\x80\\x99t a sintre piece, man! â\\x80\\x99Tis a urn they put bra-aths in, but I expects a London man would ca-al it so-o-p ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, sir ! for soup !â\\x80\\x94a silver turin ! â\\x80\\x98 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the article. And mind me it be zolid silver, good. None of yer gim-cracks for me!â\\x80\\x99 said Captain Wonce. Then, coming back to the inn, he says to his self, â\\x80\\x98I wonder what cousin Jinnifer Bullen would think of sich a fine urn to hold bra-aths in ! I have not seeâ\\x80\\x99d she or Anthony for many a day past. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll write to â\\x80\\x99em, and invite â\\x80\\x99em to Wheal Fortun Cassel. And their niece, tu, as I hears, is growed a fine gal.â\\x80\\x99WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. So it come to pass some time after Maister and Missus and Miss Fanny start away in the Coburg to Wheal Fortun Cassel. The High Sheriff did it in proper style. He was standing with his four serving men in red plush on the steps, and he on the topmost step, as seemed to me suitable he had climbed the ladder to fortune. He say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Wilcome! wilcome, cousin Jinnifer, yer goodman and niece, Miss Fanny. I am proud to see ye ! â\\x80\\x99 Shrew man as he was, a fine brave girl as Miss Fanny delight he, and he werenâ\\x80\\x99t above showing proud of sich a beauty. And he showed up all, and hand â\\x80\\x99em all about. Maister says,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x99Tis a rare sight; but they boiling steam houses for plants is tâ\\x80\\x99 much for me. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll walk â\\x80\\x99ee around by yer ricks and meadows to the back, and see yer Jarsey heifers, if I may.â\\x80\\x99 But Missus, she say, â\\x80\\x98 my,â\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98 My life, Fannee, look here!â\\x80\\x99 hundreds and hundreds of times. And he, Captain Wonce, prettily delighti7o IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP in Miss Fanny, and cracked away his jokes fine, and she laughed right gay as she had not done for a long-full time. He cut her flowers, and he said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ll keep the rest; for to-morrow night Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to give a ba-al.â\\x80\\x99 Now, even to Vogue Parish, where we lived long and hearty, â\\x80\\x99tis gloom time some 172 times, and some are called away ; and about this time we lost our old Rector, Dr Tregon- pol, and I may say the parish was widowed with the loss of he. And the boys and maids fatherless. Fifty and two year he had been Rector ; and he was a past master in learning before he come, for Vogue was a College living, and learned and steady men always filled it. Then come Dr Gwinear to the parish, and his sister, Miss Kattern - Ann Gwinear, both proper Cornish gentry, though they had lived to Oxford a longish bit. Miss Kattern-Ann was as learned every bit as her brother, Dr Peter Luke Gwinear, D. D. The Vogue people soon highly respected Miss Kattern-WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 171 Ann; but she was certainly â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x99centrix,â\\x80\\x99 as they say. She took things up with a flourish. All the parish must gan her gait then. Sometimes â\\x80\\x99twas one thing, sometimes â\\x80\\x99twas another â\\x80\\x94 the sick and the old, the cottage â\\x80\\x99orspital â\\x80\\x94 she set going ; then â\\x80\\x99twas the babies as she knew nothing about â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 a crÃªsk,\\' as she say. She was all for thrift, and to be clean and tidy. Of course the ontidy ones did not like it, and the tidy ones could do without it. â\\x80\\x98 So there â\\x80\\x99twas.â\\x80\\x99 She would come in and sweep the cottages out herself, if a person was sick cover â\\x80\\x99em up with sheets ; and the dust she kicked up ! and the pitchers she broke ! and the children she frightenâ\\x80\\x99d ! They used to say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98There is Miss Kattern-Ann, like a cat in a garret ! â\\x80\\x99 The parish was tidied up fine ! Fancy a village wash-house over the stream, and the â\\x80\\x99pliances, hot and cold, manglingâ\\x80\\x94 so the husbands should not have the washing about ! Miss Kattern-Ann say to her brother,â\\x80\\x94â\\x80¢172 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP â\\x80\\x98 Peter-Luke, I leave the godliness to you in the parish ; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll look after the cleanli 172 ness.â\\x80\\x99 So they was called by those names in the parish â\\x80\\x94 Miss Cleanliness and Dr Godliness. I donâ\\x80\\x99t hold by calling names, but it seemed suitable to they two. In looks they was quite a pair â\\x80\\x94 thin and tall, and most clever look 172 ing ; but Dr Gwinear was the mildest and the humblest. He would say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 My dear, dear Kattern - Ann, the people will not be ruled in this way.â\\x80\\x99 But she never hearkenâ\\x80\\x99d. She say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Peter-Luke, they must ! it is high time some one took them in hand ! â\\x80\\x99 But Dr Gwinear was great for schools ; he built the schools, and in his time the church was restored. They are going on at that. So little is left of the old Vogue church, with what they call restoring. Ye have heard me speak of Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom. He had left the navy and had gone off in the â\\x80\\x98 Sea Pinkâ\\x80\\x99 with Mr Johnnie Pen- coose. It was nigh upon two years sinceWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. *73 the â\\x80\\x98Sea Pinkâ\\x80\\x99 had left. One day, the carrierâ\\x80\\x99s cart, that goes to Mariassic stoppâ\\x80\\x99d and let he down, Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom; and pretty astonished we were! He had lost the use of one leg, and he was blind of one eye. No more hornpipes for poor Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom. â\\x80\\x98We asked how he come to be such a cripple.â\\x80\\x99 He say, Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98It is too long a tale to tell ye standinâ\\x80\\x99 here, right to the middle of the road, and, moreoâ\\x80\\x99r, I shall not tell ye much till I have spake my message to Squire Pencoose. â\\x80\\x98 Where is the â\\x80\\x9c Sea Pink ; â\\x80\\x9d youâ\\x80\\x99ll tell us that much; and where is Mr Johnny Pen 172 coose ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98The â\\x80\\x9cSea Pinkâ\\x80\\x9d I should haâ\\x80\\x99 think is in Greek waters by now. Mr Johnnie Pen 172 coose, if he is alive, he is in a French prison.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What for?â\\x80\\x99 they all cried out; â\\x80\\x98What for ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 For jist sticking to his own and behav 172 ing as a true Briton and hero,â\\x80\\x99 was all Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom could say, and that arter-174 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP noon the neighbours lent him a donkey and cart, and he went off to tell his tale to Trenisky. It seems â\\x80\\x99twas time when the â\\x80\\x98 Sea Pink â\\x80\\x99 started. She ran up to Plymouth, and her honour, Mr Johnnie Pencoose, joined her there ; then they went up channel, after bit they ran into Weymouth. Mr Johnnie landed, and one evening he came off with Mons Marc in the â\\x80\\x98 Dhingy,â\\x80\\x99 and they sailed away that evening, and they ran down to Bordeaux. There we landed Mons Marc. Mr Johnnie never spoke to him all the voy 172 age. After Bordeaux we went on Bayonne ; went up the river and lay alongside the quay, but a good bit from the wharfs and the rest of the shippenâ\\x80\\x99. One morning he had up the capâ\\x80\\x99er, Capâ\\x80\\x99en Jimmoo Pomeroy, and they landed together. In the evening Capâ\\x80\\x99en Jimmoo come back and told a wisht poor tale that Mr Johnnie Pencoose had fought a duel with Mons Marc ; had brought him away from England on purpose to fight him, and it had ended bad for Mr Johnnie. He was run through the body, alive and noWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 175 more. Captain Jimmoo said he had got the doctor for him, but he could not understand the surgeon. However, he took the bullet out of his side, but he would not allow him to be moved, so Captain Jimmoo had only come to fetch brandy and things ; he would return in a few evenings ; we never saw Captain Jimmoo again. Two days after, the mate got an English letter. It told him to take the â\\x80\\x98 Sea Pink â\\x80\\x99 down the river and remain in the outer har 172 bour, and the letter was signed for J. Pencoose. Down went the â\\x80\\x98 Sea Pink,â\\x80\\x99 and in the evening she lay off the light-house. A gig came alongside with five or six men. Tu few minutes they were on the deck, the tallest, Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom would swear â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x99twas the rascal Marc?â\\x80\\x99 He went up to mate and shot him deadâ\\x80\\x94the rest of the crew he shot down ; but the cook or steward and Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom, they jumped overboard and made for shoreâ\\x80\\x94they fired at them from the yachtâ\\x80\\x94he felt he was hit on the head. The steward, Tim Timmings, was not hurt. They crawled away and hid themselves, and176 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP they saw the â\\x80\\x98 Sea Pink â\\x80\\x99 sail away. The next day they was took up and put in a French barn they called a prison ; all about there Wellington had been with the English army not so many years ago, and so all about they hated the English, and would clap one into prison for nothing at all. Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom relate his escape. They was put into a sort of barn prison till the Mari (as they do call, he say, a Mayor to France), till he was satisfied they were not spies, come to plan another invasion of the English, but â\\x80\\x99twas all excuse only spite against the English. The old barn building that they locked them up in, with Timothy Tim- mingâ\\x80\\x99s, who was a Mariassic man we all knew about he, in Vogue Parish. They were put into a big room, very high up, at the top of the building. On one side there was. a door bolted strong, that led down a long flight of stone steps into the street, or rather open market-place. There was a very small window, with iron bars. No man could get in or out, but Tim, who had a very narrer head, could push it through and hold con-WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 177 verse with the market women. Market days â\\x80\\x99twas high entertainment, like fair stannings about. Rumberellas and fruit women, fine and gay stalls, with every colour hankerchees and beads and images ; he say more gay than any show down to Truro Whitsun 172 tide. The French women do screech when angry, like parrots ; when they laugh tu, they are shrill ; they all twitters like sparrows. So Tim would shout down, with his head through the bars, some one or two French words. They would laugh back and call â\\x80\\x98Singeâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Singeâ\\x80\\x99; but Tim never could make out what that meant. But there was one dark woman who Tim said must be part Spanish, and as we had sent Wellington and our army to Spain, they was friendly to us. She used to shout up â\\x80\\x98 Bo-no ! John-nÃ©.â\\x80\\x99 Tim took a great fancy to she, but â\\x80\\x99twas funny love-making. She did run up the steps once or twice, and left us something on the ledge of the window, which she could reach from the steps, but the sentry would be round, so she had to be quick about it.â\\x80\\x99178 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP We ask the jailer about her. Was she single or married ? With signs and a few words Tim knew that she had three husbands. He held up three fingers. Tim paled away a bit at this, but he showed coin. She was rich. Then he hobbled about to show the husbands were rich, but could only hobble. They called her Madame â\\x80\\x98 Epper- see-nee.â\\x80\\x99 Now, on the other side of the room was a door that opened into a verandah, but â\\x80\\x99twas a long way from the ground. There was two sentries on. One walked under the verandah, except at high water, when he was off duty, and no occasion for him to be on, as it would be more than difficult for any one to escape at high water. He would have to run the risk of passing the other sentry who did patrol to the left, the harbour side ; but that sentry used to go through a stone gateway into the street. He was told off to the street when â\\x80\\x99twas low water and the other sentry on. We used to call one sentry Mons â\\x80\\x98 Char-lot,â\\x80\\x99 as he was fond of cats (and here Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom would inform we â\\x80\\x98Charâ\\x80\\x99 was French forWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 179 cat), and all the chars would come round about the sentry, rub up against him, and sit on the wall and mew. The other we called Mons Gingerbread, he looked a proper lolly-pop gingerbread soldier. Time went on. They say, when informa 172 tion came about us, we should have our liberty ; but nothing come. We used to talk how to escape, but we could see nothing for it if we attempted it but a bullet through our head. At last the jailor say a ransome would do it, pay the Mari a sum of money. On market days Timâ\\x80\\x99s yellow curls were thrust out through the bars, and he would laugh and kiss his hand to Madame â\\x80\\x98 Epper-see- nee,â\\x80\\x99 who laughed back, â\\x80\\x98 Bo-no â\\x80\\x99 JohnnÃ©e. They say love laughs at locksmithâ\\x80\\x99s, â\\x80\\x99twas true here ; perhaps â\\x80\\x99twas stronger for the bars. One day Tim says to me,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom, what is stronger than water ? â\\x80\\x99 1 Brandy,â\\x80\\x99 says I. â\\x80\\x98 No â\\x80\\x99tis not,â\\x80\\x99 says Tim. â\\x80\\x98Yes â\\x80\\x99tis,â\\x80\\x99 says I.i8o IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP â\\x80\\x98 Well â\\x80\\x99tisnâ\\x80\\x99t what I mean. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s stronger than fire or water ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Canâ\\x80\\x99t say,â\\x80\\x99 says I, â\\x80\\x98unless â\\x80\\x99tis courage as would brave all.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No â\\x80\\x99tisnâ\\x80\\x99t courage, â\\x80\\x99tis love, true love.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That ainâ\\x80\\x99t my line,â\\x80\\x99 says I. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Tis mine,â\\x80\\x99 says Tim. â\\x80\\x98I do watch my true love flutter and twitter here and there to every stall she buying and selling. I do love her pretty ways, as a bird moth sucking honey to summer flowers, so she do whizz and buzz and flutter.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98That is the power oâ\\x80\\x99 fancy,â\\x80\\x99 says I. â\\x80\\x98 Now to me she be nothing but a dark-skinned fidget, and her voice is pitched high, like a gale oâ\\x80\\x99 wind in the rigging ; â\\x80\\x99twould always make me think of boister weather, but then sheâ\\x80\\x99s kind tu. She have brought we that eggy meat swimming in oil.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x99Tis proper French to call it a hom-low-let. â\\x80\\x98 I be going to marry she, and she is going to pay the ransome, and we are going before the Mari to be married, and the priest will tie it after double knot.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Timothy Timmings,â\\x80\\x99 said I, â\\x80\\x98you wereWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 181 always a confiding cha-rack-ter. Somehow, if you go trusting others you never know half the time if you are wronged or not, but I would rather be hanged, drawn and quartered before Iâ\\x80\\x99d marry a French or Spanish woman.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98After to-morrow,â\\x80\\x99 said Tim, with a light heart, 1 1 shall renounce my religion and my country and become a citizen of France. Vive la France ! but I do not care to leave you here, thatâ\\x80\\x99s the worst thing about it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Never mind me, I will face it out some how.â\\x80\\x99 So the next day a lot of cocked - hatted gentry came and let Tim free to go to his wedding, God bless him. Tim was gone, yellow hair, blue eyes, a face that cheerâ\\x80\\x99d even a prison, hope he will be happy with his Epper-see-nee in her little shop, her soap and her candles, and her smart smelling herrins, and all her twitterings ways, I sigh. Then I turned tuâ\\x80\\x94to think a bit. Hope on, hope ever is a passport to freedom. One day, looking over the harbour from the verandah, I saw a sail come up the river that made my heart beat high. I knew the102 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP cut of her jib. I had seen her lie along the quay to Mariassic. I never forget a sail more nor do I a face, â\\x80\\x99twas a bit of home. She came from the Port oâ\\x80\\x99 Fowey, say I. It made my heart dance so with hope. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be walking her deck to-morrow night, or I shall be lying at the bottom of Bayonne Harbour. The next day I saw she had anchored in the middle of the harbour, and she was loading with Spanish oranges, nuts, and all the bottle sweets made at Buyone, as the French call it. Towards evening she had a scrap of Blue Peter ; that bit of blue bunting gave me courage to be once more under the rag, but how many hours to dark and high water ? Dark, â\\x80\\x99twill never come. How light it is. The tide will never turn. Sick at heart I went in and out on the stone landing of the high verandah to survey. The sentry, Mons Char-lot, would be off duty, and Mons Gingerbread would be the one I should have to deal with. There were two yards to run down by the side of the wall. I should not be seen, the sentry walked the other side, I could easyWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. swing myself off the verandah on to the steps. I should not be seen until I was half-way down to the water, but there was a low wall, about four feet, running across, the darkest night I should be seen by the sentry against the sky getting over the wall, I should not have much chance with his musket. Tramp, tramp, he goes, it seemed like a-walking on oneâ\\x80\\x99s heart with every tramp. The sentry march between me and freedom, with his musket clutched in his arms. A rig-gu-lar cock sparrer of a Frenchman, was Mons Gingerbread. I went inside and took my jacket off to tie to the verandah rail to let myself down by. In my thoughts I went further afield. Who knows I may be helped. Poor mortal as I was, just a-wishing for home and freedom before my time come. It seemed an answer, and yet I did not know it at the time, as is often the case. The key turned in the street door, and the jailor looked in with my supper, and an old priestee with him as had come before, to convart one perhaps, but he didnâ\\x80\\x99t know any English at all to speak of, and I didnâ\\x80\\x99t184 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP know any French, but heâ\\x80\\x99d jabber in his way. He used to stay about twenty minutes, and then the jailor would come back. I saw my way now. I was glad I had torn up my jacket ready. The old priestee took off his big hat, like a rumberella, and put it on the bench ; he undid his greatcoat and pulled out of his breast pocket a big sarsage. He hand it to me, and he say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Eat-ee well, good-ee night,â\\x80\\x99 I took it and buttoned it up in my waist 172 coat. A sarsage might be something between me and death-hunger. In one minute I had whipped out my jacket over his head, tied and gagged him, in another second got his coat off, strapped his ankles together and laid him gently in the corner ; he never struggled a bit. Like a child I said, â\\x80\\x98Good-ee night, sleep-ee well,\\' for he was a good old priestee. I caught up his hat. I had his greatcoat over the verandah. The drop was not so bad as I thought. All right. I put on the great 172 coat and the hat. Now take your timeWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 185 Tom Johns Tom, I said. Time and courage does it ; but donâ\\x80\\x99t hurry whatsâ\\x80\\x99ver. So I stepped out into the middle of the yard, got on to the wall, over it, half the battle was won. But the sentry sees me. Whether he did not like to see a priest climbing over the wall or not, he challenge. It would not do not to stop, he might fire. I muttered like a priest I thought, and pointed to a little boat as if I was going out in it. I hoped he would think to visit some sick person. I was being fetched ; it was getting pretty dusky. Just then a figure in my prison verandah waved his hands, the priest had worked himself free. The sentry looked up and laughed, thanks to our often chaffing him, he only saw the prisoner was safe in the verandah, and he let me pass. I was down the next yard in a trice, stuffed away the priesteeâ\\x80\\x99s hat and cloak under a boat, and plunged into the river, swam off to the English schooner. As I swam round her I could see on her stern, in large white letters, the â\\x80\\x98 Pandora, Fowey.â\\x80\\x99 John Pomeroy, Captain Jimmooâ\\x80\\x99s brother. K186 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP I sang out â\\x80\\x98 Hoy, one of Fowey.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Aye, aye. I was soon aboard. John had come more than for anything else to trace his brother Jimmoo more than for trade. It was over two years since the â\\x80\\x98 Sea Pink â\\x80\\x99 had been taken by that pirate Frenchman. John Pomeroy had just found out his brother was a prisoner at Toulon, and Mr Johnnie Pencoose with him. The way I limpy now was that drop from the verandah injured my leg, though I did not feel it at the time, and I lost my eye when the ruffians fired at us in the water when we escaped from the â\\x80\\x98 Sea Pink.â\\x80\\x99 Capen John Pom 172 eroy thought he would get home, and I should inform the Squire about his son as money might be wanted. We were all inter-es-ted in Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tomâ\\x80\\x99s adventure, and we hoped Squire Pencoose would see his son back, but we never thought to see the â\\x80\\x98 Sea Pink â\\x80\\x99 again. Next we heard Madame Pencoose and Miss Jinny and Sally were going to France to search for their brother. Miss Sally came to say good-bye to Miss Fanny, they had longWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 187 talks, and I had been just callâ\\x80\\x99d down by Missus Bullen to shake a swaâ\\x80\\x99m of bees, but I over hear Miss Sally say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Poor Johnnie, to think he has been a prisoner two years and a quarter, and ill from his wound great part of the time. I canâ\\x80\\x99t make out why he did not write ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Because he would never learn to write, and Captain Jimmoo Pomeroy canâ\\x80\\x99t write either.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But what did they put him in prison for ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Because Johnnie is so well known as a great smuggler; he smuggled a lot of English laces into France.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Johnnie is well known as a smuggler as would dare anything,â\\x80\\x99 said Miss Sally Pencoose ! . â\\x80\\x98 Mr Johnnie Pencoose ought to be ashamed of himself, I have no pity for him, he de 172 serves a French prison for smuggling.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Fanny, how hard hearted you are. I shall take him your love. I know you have been a little bit sorry for him, and have missed him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Nonsense, Sally. I have not been in the least sorry for him, and I certainly have not missed him.â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER XI.

He had a grand sounding name, â\\x80\\x99twas â\\x80\\x98Clarence Buckingham Chesterfield Howard Warwick.â\\x80\\x99 Some â\\x80\\x99quistive people said to him, â\\x80\\x98If I may make so bold, Dr Clarence Buckingham Ches 172 terfield Howard Warwick, how did ye come by they names ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am sole survivor of a long line of kings and princes, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m heir of all.â\\x80\\x99 Then he would bow and wave his hand, and say,â\\x80\\x94 * I have finished my au - di - ence.

Dr Herby, as we will call him short, though â\\x80\\x99twas not right, as Missus Bullen said, because he was mad, he should be callâ\\x80\\x99d out of his name. Poor old gentleman, I said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Yes, sure, Missus, and any one can see he have lived in higher movements.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99said Mrs Bullen, â\\x80\\x98I always take care to call him by all his names, which pleases him mighty, and â\\x80\\x99tis something to give the afflicted pleasure, and so cheap too ! â\\x80\\x99 Dr Herby was an uncommon figure of a man, six feet three, and as thin as a whip 172 ping post ; he wore a faded claret-coloured coat down to his ankles, in summer and winter he was in that overcoat ; he had a very stiff frill to his shirt, which was always as white as a whiting-pollocker fin, a sugar- loaf hat, with dents over it, but no prince ever lifted his hat with a finer sweep of his arm and a prettier bend of his body. â\\x80\\x99Twere very prettily done sure enough. The history how he come to Mariassic wasIN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP odd. One summerâ\\x80\\x99s night a fine carriageâ\\x80\\x94 a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s travelling carriageâ\\x80\\x94drove into the town, and put down Dr Herby at the Sloop Inn, and a box or trunk or two, that looked as if he had been a travellâ\\x80\\x99d gentle 172 man. His coat was new, and his hat, and he had a few pounds in his pocket, but he did not seem to have the wit to go into the Sloop, or knock they up, so all night he roved about the quays and cliffs till some one took him in. Some was very kind to him ; but no one could find out where he came from, or by what orders he was left that night at Mariassic. Of course the boys mocked and jeered, but Bonnypeart Neptune befriend he, and beat the boys if he saw he was being made a games ; he was too mild a gentleman for Mariassic boys. He picked up a few pence by his herb medicines, but he never liked taking money, so they gave him to eat and drink instead. Bill Pearce was took ill ; he catched a chill, and it played upon his pipe, which was bad for poor Bill, as he loved to roar and shout in common talk through his pipes.WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. >93 One day Mar Teezer said to Missus,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Missus, I think as how we must call in Dr Herby for Bill, to cure the craze on his pipes.â\\x80\\x99 Says Missus,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Dr Herby have done some cliver things, but I should not like to trust he over much in a bad illness. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think Bill Pearce is in jeopardy, so you can con 172 sult Dr Herby if you like ; his cough might give to simples, such as mugwort tea, peppermint, treacle posset, and the like.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Why, Missus, we have givâ\\x80\\x99d Bill nigh upon a horse pail full of mugwort and berga 172 mot tay, and the cough have not delayed the leastist a bit,â\\x80\\x99 so says Mar Teazer, â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ll waylaid Dr Herby, and he will give I a remeddy as will work a cure, if it ainâ\\x80\\x99t change of moon. Heâ\\x80\\x99s to be trusted. â\\x80\\x99Tis always the growing of the moon he is wuss. Woolly Woollatron du say â\\x80\\x99tis well on the wane jist now, so Dr Herby will subscribe for Bill with all his wits ; no fear when I do lay the case plain before un. So Iâ\\x80\\x99ll way-194 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP laid Dr Herby before he go home to his tea in Tres-es-pan Long Lane.â\\x80\\x99 The sun was getting low to the westward as Maria Teazer rounded into Tres-es-pan Long Lane. â\\x80\\x99Twas a beautiful broad lane, and a green ride on each side, a deep ditch, and high hedges ; and that lane was the most famous herbal lane all about, there was no such another in Cornwall. Herbs congregate there as would cure any disease, if you knew how to use â\\x80\\x99em a-right. From this broad lane you had a wide view of the county up to the Cheese Wring, and down to St. Annâ\\x80\\x99s Beacon, fifty miles more, and sideways from the Lizard to the Start. In the middle of this lane, with his stick a-gru-ing about in the long ditch grass for some herb as worked magic was Dr Herby. As Mar Teazer come along the grassy side- path, though she had her pattens on, she could not be heard. Dr Herby was talking to his self, as his way was. â\\x80\\x98 Ah, rare viper-growing plant, where art thou ; the slug that loves thee heaves itsWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 195 glossy sides. Thou must be near, oh, magic- working weed.â\\x80\\x99 Dr Herby talked as doth a sermon in flower language. Mar Teazer coughed. â\\x80\\x98 Ah-hem ! Plaise, Doctor, our Bill to Tre- dinnick has growed fine and bad, latter weeks he is crazed on his pipes is Bill.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Bill! Bill! No, woman! A Billâ\\x80\\x94a dis 172 grace to humanity in a thousand waysâ\\x80\\x94thou canst repay me, but never by base coin.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99Tis a live Bill I am talking of, not of figgers upon papur, sir.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 A live Bill is he ; he will soon be a dead one. Know, woman, I had a patient I knew must be blooded to save his life. I â\\x80\\x94 I should have bled him in the arm. Iâ\\x80\\x94I made a slight mistake between the arm, andâ\\x80\\x94and the throat,â\\x80\\x99 said Dr Herby with a soft sigh. â\\x80\\x98 You did not cut his throat, did you, sir?â\\x80\\x99 said Mar Teazer, all aghast. â\\x80\\x98 What- evir,â\\x80\\x99 she say to herself ; â\\x80\\x98 whatevir Woolly Woollaton do say. It must beâ\\x80\\x94be the grow 172 ing of the moon !

It took me sometime to sew it up again. It was a delicate, difficult operation; he grew better, but he never required my services again. Iâ\\x80\\x94I was not called in for consultation.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, sir, but us would rather try simples for Bilâ\\x80\\x94Wil-ly-am Pearce, simples, sir, would agree best along with he.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 Simples ? in that lieth wisdom. What are the symptoms of the simple ? â\\x80\\x99 A gleam came into his eye, as a spark of fun, but it became grey-ash in a minute, his poor wandering mind. With his long white fingers and restless hand, Dr Herby was placing in his ritticule some power-giving weeds. When he lifted up his voice with a shout, â\\x80\\x98 Called in for consultation,â\\x80\\x99 and leapt into the ditch, and tuggâ\\x80\\x99d and draggâ\\x80\\x99d at a milky dice-sal. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99Tis the growing of the moon,â\\x80\\x99 moaned Mar Teazer on the bank. â\\x80\\x98Shall I catch hold of his coat tails, or leave him bide. Pâ\\x80\\x99raps a jerk suddint to his coat tails would make his wits fly upwards. Nimble DrWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 197 Herby was by this time through the ditch, and half way up the hedge on tâ\\x80\\x99other side of the deep ditch, talking or tongue-ing away to his self, and tugging at the herbs about. Mar Teazer thought â\\x80\\x98Tâ\\x80\\x99will be over my pattens the swa-ampee ground. I shall be proper staggâ\\x80\\x99d if I du slipper away in there. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing for it but to go in after he, if he will only then give his mind to a remeddy.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I wants, sir, a remeddy for Wil-ly-am Pearceâ\\x80\\x99s cough.â\\x80\\x99 She reached up, and tuggâ\\x80\\x99d at Dr Herbyâ\\x80\\x99s coat tails. Now Mar Teazer was strong of arm, and Dr Herby was reedy - like and shaky, and she overbalanced the poor old gentleman, and he cap-a-size. He come dy 172 ing back on her, right into the muddy ditch. He come up with an outside coat of mud. It shook he much, but he never thought any one would harm him, and he never blamed any one, but sat dripping on the bank forlorn, and said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x94I am oblee-gi-ed to you, good woman. Iâ\\x80\\x94I lost my balance ; I am light of head. Unfortunately my head soon goes. I am1 9 8 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP obleegi-ed greatly oblie-gied,â\\x80\\x99 as his teeth began to chatter. Mar Teazer sponged his hat and coat for him, as he sat on the bank by the roadside in Tres-es-pan Long Lane. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, sir, donâ\\x80\\x99t mintion itâ\\x80\\x94a remeddy for the cough, sir ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Take this,â\\x80\\x99 holding out the milky dice-sal, â\\x80\\x98 put it into a bag, wear it round your neck for six months, the cough will leave you.â\\x80\\x99 Then he said, affecting solemn, â\\x80\\x98Woman it is the best known remedy,â\\x80\\x99 said Dr Herby with a grand air. â\\x80\\x98 Round my neck, sir, or Bilâ\\x80\\x94Wil-ly-ams ? â\\x80\\x99 said Mar Teazer. â\\x80\\x98It is of no consequence, none whatever. It will work its cure either way.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Thank you, sir, and Missusâ\\x80\\x94Missus Bullen of Tredinnick would be glad if you call into lunch when you was a-passing, sir.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah, thanks, Madame Tredinnick, my good friend. My respectful compliments. You know my name. Dr Clarence Buckingham Chesterfield Howard Warwick, his compli 172 ments to Madame Tredinnick.â\\x80\\x99WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 199 He rose and bowed a â\\x80\\x98 Prince Regentâ\\x80\\x99s bow,â\\x80\\x99 as Miss Fanny said, a grand prescence, though bespattered with mud, and, worse still, with his poor wits fled. â\\x80\\x98 Thereâ\\x80\\x99s the moon, but whether â\\x80\\x99tis the growing or â\\x80\\x99tis on the wane I canâ\\x80\\x99t say. He seemed sensible when he got shook up a bit. Poor Dr Herby! I did not mean to topple he over, but he is a real gentleman, no mistake. He had sense â\\x80\\x99nuff to know I did not mean it, and how sorry I were he would not ac-cuse ! He was only very much oblee-gi-ed to I ; thatâ\\x80\\x99s being a proper gentleman, that is! â\\x80\\x99Tis long past milking hour. I always like to watch that Susannah ; she donâ\\x80\\x99t know how tu ! one leastest bit ; not she,â\\x80\\x99 mutters Mar Teazer, the ways homeward. That evening Mar Teazar says to Bill Pearce,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Which ever shall it be, Bill; here is the bag made, and I have put in the milky dice-sal, sewed well up, and a bit of rib-bain. Shall ye wear it or me ? â\\x80\\x99IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP â\\x80\\x98 What call should I a-wear it ? If thee has faith in the remeddy, thee can wear it,â\\x80\\x99 wheazed and groaned Bill in the warm chimbly corner. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, come ! What for to go and spake like that? If no good rise it canâ\\x80\\x99t do harm, and â\\x80\\x99tis not all doctorsâ\\x80\\x99 stuff as can be held that blameless,â\\x80\\x99 said Mar Teazer. Bill, sitting on the kitchen settle close to a roar fire, said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 How old do you think I be, Mar ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 As old as yourn littler finger, and a littler older than your teeth,â\\x80\\x99 said sprightly Mar T eazer. â\\x80\\x98 I be one score and seven years old ; how old be ye, Mar ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, my birth-a-day is gone pastâ\\x80\\x94thereâ\\x80\\x99s no count kept now-a-days, â\\x80\\x99tis past, gone past â\\x80\\x94was you thinking of a prisint, Bill ? â\\x80\\x99 Bill says with a yawn, for he was sleepy ways,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 The prisint I was a-think of was mee-self ? â\\x80\\x99 1 Lor, I never, now ! â\\x80\\x99 was the coy answer. â\\x80\\x98 What do ye make of it ? â\\x80\\x99 says Bill, with a wonder stare to Mar.WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 201 â\\x80\\x98 Make of it !

Now, Miss Fanny had become a great favourite with Captain Wonce, and she had a gay time to Wheal Fortune Cassel. She was often down there, she would come back that gay and light-hearted, and tell her father and we all what she had seen and done ; which, to my mind, is half the battle ; young people enter into the fray of pleasure, and then recite it all to we old ones by the fireside or on the bench on the grass plat. Captain Wonce gave Miss Fanny a nice horse to ride, and equipt it proper, so she was as well mount as Miss Sally or Miss Jinny; and then Cap 172 tain Wonce said to Mrs Bullen,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Here now, cousin Jinnifer, I shall give Fanny a free gift on her wedding-day of ten thousand pounds ; and I let this be known. 203 l204 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to make her a catch for an adventurer, but she will have her dower.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Thank you, cousin Walter; but I donâ\\x80\\x99t think Fanny will marry. When a girl keeps on saying, â\\x80\\x9c No,â\\x80\\x9d it grows to a habit ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, it didnâ\\x80\\x99t with you, cousin Jinnifer.â\\x80\\x99 Missus colour up, but she laugh. â\\x80\\x98Do you take notice how gay Fanny is?â\\x80\\x99 said Captain Wonce. â\\x80\\x98 Yes, she seems very happy,â\\x80\\x99 said Missus ; â\\x80\\x98 she has got over that fancy for that rascal Baron Laraile. Fancy, Lord Respry was telling Maister he have found it all out. This Baron was the foster-brother of the real one â\\x80\\x94of low birth, but brought up together in Paris and everywhere, and he murdered his brother, the real Lord, or Baron Laraile, and that is the reason he bolted off to England ; and then, after he fought the duel with Mr Johnnie Pencoose, he found he could not live in France ; and, when Mr Johnnie was so badly wounded, he, with other lawless fellows, made a raid on the â\\x80\\x9c Sea Pink,â\\x80\\x9d murdered nearly all the crew, and went off somewhere, they think, to Mexico.â\\x80\\x99WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 205 â\\x80\\x98 The moral to all this isâ\\x80\\x94ah ! â\\x80\\x99 said Captain Wonce, â\\x80\\x98 donâ\\x80\\x99t take up quick with furriners ! I is somewhat slow to give myself away to an Englishman ; but I do take timeâ\\x80\\x94snail- pace time with a furriner.â\\x80\\x99 The lady who wrote to Lord Respry be 172 lieved he was her nephew, the real Baron Laraile. â\\x80\\x98 Well, his Lordship had a near squeak with the cold muzzle of the pistol on his temple. Such luck as the rascal got, to get clear off twice!â\\x80\\x99 said Captain Wonce. â\\x80\\x98 But, cousin Jinnifer, you have not seemed to understand why Fanny is so happy. I see it ; donâ\\x80\\x99t you ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said Missus. â\\x80\\x98Perhaps â\\x80\\x99tis change, her new life, and the pleasure she gets out of Wheal Fortune Cassel.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x99Tis because of Miss Sally Pencooseâ\\x80\\x99s letter that Mr Johnnie is found, and all right, and coming back.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t think so,â\\x80\\x99 said Missus. â\\x80\\x98 Fannee always said she hated him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Now, that is hopeful,â\\x80\\x99 said Captain Wonce, â\\x80\\x98 if she had said she liked him,206 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP â\\x80\\x99twould have been the moon indeed for Mr Johnnie to cry for.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Miss Fanny Uglow, dear Miss Fanny, my boy is home again, he is. My boy, such bursting joy,â\\x80\\x99 shout Squire Pencoose, on horseback, looking in through the big gates of the garden. Miss Fanny got up, she had been kneel 172 ing down planting seedlings after a June shower. She came towards the Squire with her white drawn hat, her fresh peach colour and her sweet eyes. Her heart went out to the old father for his love for his boy, though the boy was real such a tiresome, rough young man. After that Miss Fanny saw all the Pencoose family one by one, but not Mr Johnnie. Madame come in French silk, not smuggled this time. â\\x80\\x98 He have to send many ambasseedo-ers,â\\x80\\x99 said Mar Teazer. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99Tis said Miss Fanny will punish â\\x80\\x99em all for their high mighty- ness. They has to make a pilgrimage on their knees from Trenisky to Tredinnick.â\\x80\\x99WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 207 At last Miss Fanny met him at the hunt. The meet was at Trevogue. She bowed stiff to begin with, but he got off his horse and shook hands. She said very little, and was very grave. He looked very pale. Some said not his old self. â\\x80\\x98 I says improvement.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 they says, â\\x80\\x98hardly for a rollicking chap as Mr Johnnie Pencoose.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But why shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t he leave that behind and become more mannerly,â\\x80\\x99 says I. Now, coming home that day Miss Fannyâ\\x80\\x99s horse lamed himself as the bank slipped with her, and they rolled back together. She was glad of Mr Johnnieâ\\x80\\x99s help. â\\x80\\x98Hullo! who is gone into the ditch? Is it you, Sally ? â\\x80\\x99 Coming through the wood he had not seen who it was. â\\x80\\x98 Noâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x94isâ\\x80\\x94Fanny. Crusader has stuck fast, poor fellow, and I canâ\\x80\\x99t get offâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, wait a bit, Fanny.â\\x80\\x99 He nearly choked with the utter of his old playmateâ\\x80\\x99s name. Now, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t leave it to me, you will come to grief; he will roll over on208 IN a CORNISH TOWNSHIP you,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94with a good deal of temper as he was getting anxious how to get her off. â\\x80\\x98 Conâ\\x80\\x94 if you touch him Fanny, you will be crushed. Now, give me your hand. He pulled her off the saddle on to the thorn hedge and that was the way he won her, masterful. â\\x80\\x98 Give me your hand,â\\x80\\x99 and she gave it tu. His cap was off, and in his black hair threads of silver she noticed, not there before he left. He pulled her up among the thorns and brambles. â\\x80\\x98 Now, are you safe ? â\\x80\\x99 Their eyes met, she laughed and coloured. â\\x80\\x98Johnnie, you are as rough as ever.â\\x80\\x99 He gave one glance round the thicket ; no one there. He put his arm round her waist and kissed her. Only an old fox saw it, A fellow creature. We had two weddings that year of import. Gentle and simple. Mar Teazer and Bill Pearce were married first, between the cattle harvestâ\\x80\\x94as we do callWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 209 hay harvestâ\\x80\\x94and the harvest of corn as is sent for man. After the wedding, before dinner (as Missus was going to give at Tredinnick), we walked the whole parish, a goodly pair (party), to show ourselves proper to the whole Vogue Parish. Mar Teazer was off with her pattens, so she had not such a spring-heel tread. Susannah was bridesmaid, with her beau, Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom. His cripple-ship was growing over ; but he, of course, was still blind of one eye, and that, he say, â\\x80\\x98 was no green light in the starboard bow.â\\x80\\x99 He liked â\\x80\\x98 a roll in land once upon a time.â\\x80\\x99 But after we had nigh compassed the parish, he say, Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 The shelves be certain high out hereâ\\x80\\x94 too high for me to reach the victuals ! Let us rin into port, where the contents of the shelves be on Missus Bullenâ\\x80\\x99s kitchen table.â\\x80\\x99 So we face about right face, and turned into Tres-es-pan Long Lane; and, as luck would have it, we, walking in twoâ\\x80\\x99s and210 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP twoâ\\x80\\x99s, Mar Teazer and Bill Pearce giving the lead, with white gloves and favours as big as a cheese-plate, we met Dr Herby. â\\x80\\x98 Now, Bill, return thanks for that milky dice-sal remeddy. You have wored it six months, and your cough have aised off.â\\x80\\x99 Bill say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 You spake, Mar. For one day I said â\\x80\\x99nuff to parson,â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c For richer, for poorerâ\\x80\\x94I, thee and thou!â\\x80\\x9d You spake up, Mar.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Dr Herby stood wildered-like in the middle of Tres-es-pan Long Lane as the wedding party came up to him.

Who is the crier there now ? I must send Bill to tell him to cry it to once.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98A. Dabchick, I reckon. Father and son have been town criers for generation upon generation. Now,â\\x80\\x99 said Maister, â\\x80\\x98 I will tell ye how I come to know Dabchick is the name of Mariassic town criers, because of the miracle plays, as was performed to Mariassic, that is what the name of the town is taken from, Mariassic or miracle. When I was a little one, they had the miracle plays, and a Joshua Dabchick was always King Pharoah. There was gipsy blood in â\\x80\\x99em, and they wore black ringlets, which they kept very long for the plays, so as to look like a king of Egypt,214 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP and sharp, long noses. Then there was every generation a Warwatha, with yellow hair like a cloak, for King Pharoahâ\\x80\\x99s daughter. They kept characters to families. I can see â\\x80\\x99em now, Pharoahâ\\x80\\x99s daughter walking first with a little Moses in a rush basket, and her maids carry over her head a mighty ainshunt oiled-cloth rumberella. After they had marched the streets on to the quay it used to get a bit mixed, and she, Pharoahâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, walked hitch-arm with St George ; and they had a little bull calf for the dragon, with tin scales over him, but the dragon was always upsetting the play, and dragging â\\x80\\x99em where they did not want to go. I know when they begun to spake they always in 172 troduced themselves with,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Here comes I, St George the Bold.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 Then some one would roar close to the bull calf,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Here comes I, the Dragon bold, with my long teeth and scurvey jaw. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll crunch un in my maw.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cHere comes I, Miss Pharoah, his darter, that took a Hebrew babe from the wa-ater,â\\x80\\x9dWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 215 â\\x80\\x98 I used to like that play, â\\x80\\x99twas daylight, and gay was the dressing up of boats and men to Mariassic quay. Every â\\x80\\x9c Peter-tide â\\x80\\x9d was the time. But I remember one play I dreamed of for years and years after, â\\x80\\x99twas the awfullest play, â\\x80\\x99twas the Day of Judg 172 ment. I know my great aunt, Miss Nanny Nanscarron, she said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Twas well to take Anthony, chield, as â\\x80\\x99twould have an effect on he.

The room was a big one, there was only the light of farden rush-light, you know\\', Missus, as they put into a big cullender thing, so the rush-light made awful Oâ\\x80\\x99s of light on w\\'all and ceiling; and Aunt Nanny dragged my things any ways over my head.

If ever I feel inclined to laugh out of place at a solemn time, I had only to think of the Day of Judgment rendered to Mari 172 assic town.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Missus, getting up and walking across the lawn, â\\x80\\x98 I must send Bill to Mari 172 assic, and have yer watch seals and chain cried.â\\x80\\x99 So Miss Fanny and Mr Johnnie Pen-IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP coose was left to their courting the summer day. Mr Dabchick ring his bell, so Bill say, on the quay to Mariassic town, and he shout,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, yes ! oh, yes !â\\x80\\x94Lost, stolen, or stray- ayed a gold watch and chain, with a fine race of seals appendaged there on ! â\\x80\\x98 The property of Mr Anthony Bullen of Tredinnick Farm, in the parish of Vogue, in the county of Cornwall ! â\\x80\\x98 Whoever shall return the same afore-said watch and chain, and seals appendaged there on to the rightful honour shall be rewarded in a becoming manner ! Oh, yes ! oh, yes ! â\\x80\\x99 But never was any watch and seals heard of. After some time, Missus says to Mr Johnnie Pencoose,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 I wish you would do me a favour ; if you see Mr John Hooper out with the harriers, or anywhere, when you are up near Ladock, you would ask him â\\x80\\x9cwhere Maister watch and seals be tu ? â\\x80\\x9d and, please, donâ\\x80\\x99t tell Fannee or the Maister till you have enquired of Mr John Hooper.â\\x80\\x99WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 221 Mr Johnnie Pencoose promised, but of course, promises, like pie-crustes, are made to be broken, particularly in the case of lovers. So Miss Fanny laughed much, and she said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98I wish Aunt Jinnifer would not think so much of that dreadful old man. I must get Miss Kattern-Ann Gwinear to talk to her a little. She is a wise woman, if you like.â\\x80\\x99 However, Mr Johnnie Pencoose saw Mr Johnny Hooper close to Ladock wood, when he was out with the harriers. And you must know a few weeks before Missus Bullen had sent Mr Johnny Hooper a fillet of veal and a leg of pork to go with it. So when Mr Johnnie Pencoose say he had been asked by Mrs Bullen of Tredinnick if Mr Hooper could say where the watch and seals were, he had his answer quick, with,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Mrs Bullen is wilcome to know all I know. â\\x80\\x99Tis this,â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c The watch hangs â\\x80\\x99twixt earth and sky, and some day will be found ; M222 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP the chain and seals never will be foundâ\\x80\\x94so fate has sealed.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Dear, dear ! â\\x80\\x99 said Missus, â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99tainâ\\x80\\x99t much of an answer, and â\\x80\\x99twas a bravish fillet of veal too, and a tidy leg oâ\\x80\\x99 pork ! â\\x80\\x99 Years and years after Maister find the watch his-self, going throâ\\x80\\x99 an old gap in the hedge. â\\x80\\x99Twas hanging on a forky stick, just as it hitched out of Maisterâ\\x80\\x99s fob ; hanging â\\x80\\x99twixt earth and sky. They search, and search, and to this day they have never found the chain and seals â\\x80\\x94 and never will. Not long after Miss Fanny became Mrs Johnnie Pencoose, Captain Wonce died, and left Wheal Fortune Castle to Miss Fanny, with a good bit of moneyâ\\x80\\x94all his money, may say, but the present to Missus and Maister, and to the Minersâ\\x80\\x99 Hospital and Orphansâ\\x80\\x99 and Widowsâ\\x80\\x99 Home. So a year or two after, I must tell ye, there was a proper torment born in the parish. He have stoned my ducks, and he steal my apples, and I have to steal theWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 223 stick across his shoulders ! I often think it may be as how my fault he is such a torment to the parish, as I never left the north door openâ\\x80\\x99d when he was christenâ\\x80\\x99d. I mean â\\x80\\x98Wil-ly-am Teazer Pearce.â\\x80\\x99 I say he is a regular â\\x80\\x98 sprigginâ\\x80\\x99s cheild.â\\x80\\x99 (F\\'airy-sprite s child..) â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ll never believe he is all human.â\\x80\\x99 But Mar Teazer (by her husband Pearce) do say,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Ye shaâ\\x80\\x99nâ\\x80\\x99t call him a sprigginâ\\x80\\x99s cheild! He ainâ\\x80\\x99t more that than you be ; an old spriggins yourself!â\\x80\\x99 She get in a tan-trum over this torment if you call him names, Mar do. Miss Kattern-Ann even donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do by un. She have shut up the Sunday school over and over again, but â\\x80\\x99tis no good. All Vogue say he ought to be sent to say. A proper rogue of Vogue ! A long time after that Dr Gwinear was callâ\\x80\\x99d up to Oxford. They said he was to have for his learning a place of honour ; and Miss Kattern-Ann goes with him â\\x80\\x98 after re 172 forming the parish a bit,â\\x80\\x99 she say ! They wash and bake theirselves better !IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP Now Iâ\\x80\\x99m brushing up to a hunderd, I canâ\\x80\\x99t see to finish this history of Vogue Parish, so I tell it to my grit-granâ\\x80\\x99son, and he do put it down. So where â\\x80\\x99tis not quite country tongue, you know he have put in his own grammer! He is in my place in the parish, callâ\\x80\\x99d by another name ; no longer parish clerk, but sacristan !â\\x80\\x94a sur 172 plus choir! He do carry a big cross, where I did carry a stick to knack the boys heads. In some things we have gained, others we have lost. We have no learned fellows of Oxford now, but they talk a good bit, and the fashion is to despise those who went before. But I do say, where do all these young proud bigots come from ? â\\x80\\x98 Pâ\\x80\\x99raps they was born in Puffin Island!â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Seeming so ! â\\x80\\x99 they say. Still, we may be deceived in â\\x80\\x99em. And if anything will keep the strangers humble, â\\x80\\x99tis a Cornish parish now-a-days ; â\\x80\\x99tis down with everything !

Be content ; yer haveage is good as I show. Look back to your grit-grit-granâ\\x80\\x99father ! â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER XIV. Now â\\x80\\x99tis right, as Mr Johnny Hooper come on the boards of this here parish tale, that he should make his exit becoming to his wisht old character. But seeming to I, like all great men, he had a double character, there was two Johnny Hoopers! One, as I have heard tell of, and one as looks like he ; but it tai nâ\\x80\\x99t he at all, and what relayshuns they be to one another passes the wit of a full-brained man to tell ye. One picter is a plain, quiet, civil-tongued man, working with his hands that which is good, a blacksmith by trade, and â\\x80\\x98 no trader on otherâ\\x80\\x99s silly supersti-tious ignorance,â\\x80\\x99 remarks Miss Kattern-Ann. The other picter is a true crafty one, as played upon the pipes a super-natural gam- 226WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 227 mut; and the old Vogue folk danced to his piping, half in fear and half in fun. They who made the most fun of the old mortal, ended by being most timersome of being ill-wished by he. Miss Kattern-Ann do say to me. â\\x80\\x98 I sâ\\x80\\x99pose, Robert Rowe, you mean Mr Johnny Hooper had a dual existence?â\\x80\\x99 I say I sâ\\x80\\x99pose, Miss, it were a duel, which Johnny Hooper should get the upper hand of which, â\\x80\\x99tis Christian to hope, it were â\\x80\\x98 the best side up with care,â\\x80\\x99 when he leave this world. I only jist mention this double woof in Johnny Hooperâ\\x80\\x99s character, as ainâ\\x80\\x99t the same person at all. I have known a parcel of Johnny Hoopers, first and last, and they was no relayshuns to anybody else. So jist leave all the other Johnny Hoopers as ever is bide, and harken to this here old character, the last proper Cornish wizard, when he was took mortal bad he did warn all round him that the day of his funeral â\\x80\\x98 a timpest would come, as no man, woman, let alone chield, would stand against ; no, not even a parson could228 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP withstand that hurricaneâ\\x80\\x94not â\\x80\\x98 Heaven sent â\\x80\\x99 make sure ! â\\x80\\x98Of course,â\\x80\\x99 says Miss Kattern-Ann â\\x80\\x98Mr Johnny Hooper said, after me the Deluge?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, Miss, I never heard he went so far as to prophesy a Noahâ\\x80\\x99s Deluge; he only say a howling, bluster wind, blowing all points of the compass to once. So no parson clerk or people could stand against it.â\\x80\\x99 So this here wisht and doleful tale was told me by Barnabas Bright Buncombe. H ow he come by that name was so, he was born upon Saint Barnaby Brightâ\\x80\\x99s day. Saint Barnaby Bright, The longest day, and the shortest night. He had been to Amerikey and back. So when he come home he follow the fashion out there, and he drop the Bright entire, and called hisself â\\x80\\x98 Barnabas B. Buncombe.â\\x80\\x99 He was a tall talker before he went to Amerikey, and I may say he returned quite a perpendicular talker, and he was spar and rakish Yankee riggâ\\x80\\x99d, with his hat oneWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 229 side, and a nibbler of a grass week-a-days, and a flower Sundays of the season ; to my mind it did not become a clerk to bring a flower in his mouth out oâ\\x80\\x99 the vestry door, behind the parson, and as you may say only drop it with his Amensâ\\x80\\x94but that was the fashion of he ! Barnabas B. Buncombe, when he come from Amerikey, he put his-self up, and in, as parish clerk, as he said â\\x80\\x99twas hereditary clerkâ\\x80\\x99s reading desk with the Buncombes of Ladock, so he had been stalled near thirty year as clerk when Johnny Wiseman died ; and this tale he did tell as true. He was in the church with only the sexton, John Chappell, the young cu-rate come up the hill blowing as a porpoise on a summer day, and he say,â\\x80\\x94mincing,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! Mr Barnabas Buncombe, is it true that Mr Hooper foretold a storm at his funeral? It is blowing hard now. I could hardly stand against it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Tis a bit of a timpest, no mistake; but not much for sich as have weathered a tor 172 nado in the Black Sea.â\\x80\\x99IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP â\\x80\\x98 Have you been in a gale in the Black Sea, Mr Buncombe?â\\x80\\x99 says he. â\\x80\\x98 Can you, sir, point out on the globe, how to get to Amerikey and back without cir 172 cumnavigating the Black Sea ? â\\x80\\x99 But I had hardly done speaking when a wind came as if it would burst in all the church windows, and sich a howl and moan long with it, only we three in the church, and then a flash of dry lightningâ\\x80\\x94the worst that isâ\\x80\\x94without rain. It played blue and white flame over the young cu-rateâ\\x80\\x99s face, and turned John Chappellâ\\x80\\x99s ruddy countenance gashly blue. Outside the church the elements at war, groaning, creaking, panting ; the ivy, drashing and beating, torn off against the great church windows like the wings of a lost spirit. Never did I view a storm from so melancholy a place, the great double row of pillars, the black, big, oak roof, the shrieking, sighing, blowing all about the tower and the belfry, and we three awaiting, waiting for the funeral. â\\x80\\x98 They will never come ! â\\x80\\x99 says we. â\\x80\\x98 A good hour behind time.â\\x80\\x99WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 231 At last they are coming down the opposite hill. I got into my desk, and the cu-rate was peeping out oâ\\x80\\x99 the vestry door, and John Chappell begun to toll the bell. We seeâ\\x80\\x99d them coming down the hill, step by step ; at last they come to a hedge, and there they stay ever so long in the loo. John Chappell he begun to weary of dowling the bell. As he was an old man I had to encourage â\\x80\\x99un to do his duty ; so from the desk I made a speaking-trumpet of my two hands, and I shouts above the awful roaring bluster,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98Toll a bit longer, Jan!â\\x80\\x99 He could only just a-hear with my natural speaking-trumpet ; so up in the belfry old Jan nod his head. So, more to encourage â\\x80\\x99un agen, I shout, â\\x80\\x98Toll a bit longer, Jan!â\\x80\\x99 The curate he looked faint-ways. â\\x80\\x98 The tower will be crashing down ! â\\x80\\x99 says he, â\\x80\\x98and we shall be a-buried in the ruins of this here church.â\\x80\\x99 Says I,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Nobody canâ\\x80\\x99t say then the bell was not a-dowled for us ! â\\x80\\x99 Well, this went on for ever so long !232 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP At last they come to the gate. When they opened the great doors of the church, in rushed the whirlwind. â\\x80\\x99Twas getting dusk, but I could see and feel the spirits, a great army, all wild and tearing throâ\\x80\\x99 the church, they shriek and cry and moan, they rush up the tower, a pretty black lot, with black batsâ\\x80\\x99 wings, and horns ; but they kept to the north and west end, they knew their place even in church, and when we come to shut and open the door, it took a half-a- dozen strong men to do it, and â\\x80\\x99twas dark. By lantern light we buried him, before the storm lull off, so we could leave the church. Now, I, John Rowe, tell ye this tale as told to I by Barnabas B. Buncombe. It may be solemn romancing for a moral, for those who go meddling with the powers of dark 172 ness, that mortals do best to let bide. I should not have told ye such a wisht, melancholy bit ; but â\\x80\\x99tis grave and gay, black and white, the history of old Vogue folkâ\\x80\\x94sich is life ! But even ten year do make a difference, and witchcraft do only take hold of the very old or the veryWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 233 young now-a-days. Now, our oâ\\x80\\x99r learned school-maister, as come from Devonshire, he never seemed â\\x80\\x99xactly vitty to the Vogue folk ; first he was a school-maister, thinking mighty of his-self, and next he were a Devonshire man, for every born Cornish- man do know what we think of all who live the other side of the Tamar. As the saying go,â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Cornwall would be in England but for Devonshire.â\\x80\\x99 Still, there is another saying, â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Go to Devon for a wife, but stay in Cornwall for a husband !â\\x80\\x99 The school - maisterâ\\x80\\x99s name was called Bubble-bois. â\\x80\\x99Twas a name as suited him well ; for he was always a-boiling over as a tin saucepan on the hob. There was my grandchild, Rositta, as went to school. So says Mr Bubble-bois. â\\x80\\x98 Rositta, whatâ\\x80\\x99s hail ? â\\x80\\x99 Says she, sharp,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Fruzed rain.â\\x80\\x99 The cane came down on her shoulders ; so, we Rowes all had a gridge against Mr Bubble- bois for that treatment after a correct answer.234 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP So Rositta, though she were young, she were a proper growâ\\x80\\x99d woman for spite. So she get up early and she walk miles to consult a witch, Old Anice Dawe, as lived nigh upon Padstowe. She tell me she were not at all frightened walking all alone (for â\\x80\\x99tis no good for ye to go and see a witch with company). She were not frightened till a hare pops outâ\\x80\\x94 an uncommon legged hare trot down the lane in front of she. No wonder she turned cold as a stone ; for if anyone travel on the road close to a hare you donâ\\x80\\x99t forget it quick, such a forerunner. It ran round to the back of a cot, and she knew she had come to the place. When she knock, her gets a panting answer. â\\x80\\x98 If a frind, Anice Dawe do say welcome.â\\x80\\x99 Well, she give Rositta an old ham bone, and every night she was to say the Creed backwards, and hammer in a pin. When the ham bone was full of pins, so you could not put another, her enemy would drop off. Now this was un-be-known to I ; as Parish Clerk I would not have allowed no such thing. Mr Bubble-bois, however, he used to whackWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 235 the boys wellâ\\x80\\x94so out oâ\\x80\\x99 school some boys jeered at un, the other side of a hedge, and calls out,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Twill soon be a-al over wid ye Maister Bubble-bois ! Rositta Rowe have got a ham bone up the chimbly, and when thatâ\\x80\\x99s full of pins ye will drop off!â\\x80\\x99 So Mr Bubble-bois chase that boy, caught un, and made him explain. So he comes off to I, in a tower passion, to see Rositta and to punish her for the ham bone. I says,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9c No you wont, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tutor her myself, â\\x80\\x99tis a girlâ\\x80\\x99s prank ; more foolish spite than wicked.â\\x80\\x99 Says he,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98When she do come to school Iâ\\x80\\x99ll punish her.â\\x80\\x99 Says I,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98No you wonâ\\x80\\x99t, she is learnt out â\\x80\\x94 sheâ\\x80\\x99ll have no more schooling, shall Rositta ! â\\x80\\x99 Then he raved. After that he could not say too bad of we old Vogue folk. â\\x80\\x98 Ignorant, sooper-tish-us, foolish, and wicked we was.â\\x80\\x99236 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP He went to the top of Trelucky Hill and roared at we down in the church housen (village) for half the evening. And we tan-ti-lized back â\\x80\\x98 for him to hold peace, for a Devonshire dumpplen he was sure.â\\x80\\x99 That was the beginning of riggs in our otherwise quiet parishâ\\x80\\x94a timpest in a taypot â\\x80\\x94but it donâ\\x80\\x99t much matter how small the fight is to begin. Emperors do fight over as little. So we now become two parties in the parish, the Bubble - boisyers and the Clerkites. Madame Pencoose was that proud of the match Mr Johnnie Pencoose had made to marry Miss Fanny Uglow, the heiress of Captain Wonce, that she must always be talking of that â\\x80\\x98Sweet crea-char, my daughter-law,â\\x80\\x99 and that she had always set â\\x80\\x98 my heart on the match ever since she were tuckedâ\\x80\\x94to the same time as my Sally, who, with her looks and ways, you would have thought would have married an army officer, instead, â\\x80\\x99tis only a pholospher, Dr Cargreen â\\x80\\x94 double my sweet Sallyâ\\x80\\x99s age. We should have wished a more sparkling future for my sweet, sensitive Sally. My eldestWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 237 daughter Jinny, she has a presance, the Squire do admire her he doth say, â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99Tis her Ma in her prime,â\\x80\\x99 but still Sally, sweet, timid Sally, is a great comfort to me, and my prayer answered. I always prayed one of my daughters might be endued with sensi 172 bility, and in Sally my prayer was granted. As for my son Johnnie he early left my tender care. â\\x80\\x98 My dear lady,â\\x80\\x99 said the Squire, â\\x80\\x98 you could not manage him a bit, and he is already doing Fanny creditâ\\x80\\x94and yet, bless the dear boy, he was as full of mischief as an egg is full of meat. Dear, what a plague he was before, and after, he went to school ; but he never learned any book knowledge. The tales his cousins used to tell of him at school. He was always fighting boys years older than himself. He had not been six months to Barnstaple school when the biggest bully there knocked him down. They said, â\\x80\\x9cStand up to him little Johnnie Pencoose.â\\x80\\x9d Says little Johnnie, with a black eye, â\\x80\\x9cGive me a stool to stand on and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll stand up. But see fair play to put him between I and the N238 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP wall, and he is not to knock my stool over.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x99 The Squire used to laugh over his boyâ\\x80\\x99s pluck and his mischief. Doctor Jones, the headmaster to Barn 172 staple school become a lunatic whenever a blue-bottle fly buzzâ\\x80\\x99d near him. He had long hair down on his shouldersâ\\x80\\x94for all the world like a big bunch of farthing-dipsâ\\x80\\x94and when there was a blue-bottler buzzing the boys used to have to hunt and jump the forms and desks to flop at them. â\\x80\\x98 A buzz, sir. There he is, sir. I hear him, sir ! â\\x80\\x99 forty boys would shout at once. Doctor Jones was a savage for flogging ; but at the buzz of a blue bottle he was un nerved, and dash about the school-room, and his long hair was as the quills of a Red Indian, he would put his head into his desk and almost shut the cover on himself. The boys would like to have guillotined him with his own sharp desk cover. Johnnie said â\\x80\\x99twas a morning chase when the first buzz was heard. â\\x80\\x99Twas a bad time they had when no blue-bottles was about ; butWITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 239 Johnnie one day, after a martinâ\\x80\\x99s nest up on the roof of the school-house, finds in the cupola, where the bell was, a sight of blue-bottles. So he had a fine store by him, and he used to feed them to keep them lively in the winter with foiled treacle and beer on a laurel leaf ; and from his store he would fill a pill box, take it in his pocket to school and let â\\x80\\x99em out one by oneâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 Flying sport,â\\x80\\x99 as he said. When he left Barnstaple school he got his Ma to send him a fine saffron curranty cakeâ\\x80\\x94and he said, â\\x80\\x98 Mind plenty of currants.â\\x80\\x99 And he sent it to the school-maister with these lines writ by a school 172 fellow who could write, â\\x80\\x98With Mr Johnnie Pencooseâ\\x80\\x99s compliments. A cake for Doctor Jones of all the blue- bottlers he could find. Johnnie could sign his name in letters, so he signed,â\\x80\\x94 J. P,â\\x80\\x94O.Q.B.S. Which letters stood, as Johnnie says, forâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 On Quitting Barnstaple School.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94O.Q.B.S. Now, when the Squire told this here story of Mr Johnnie I was a-looking over the garden240 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP hedge, and he and Madame Pencoose had affably come to pass the compliment to me and family, to invite we to a dinner on the lawn, as a trait he was minded to give in honour of his sonâ\\x80\\x99s son - and - heir young Maister John coming into the parish of Vogue â\\x80\\x94 as he was three year old. And they was all coming up from Wheal Fortune Castle to Trenisky. So the whole parish had a trait ! Flags flying ! Bands playing ! Barons of beef and pies of all sorts ! That was the most to be lauded trait we ever had in the parish of Vogue ; all the parish was thereâ\\x80\\x94old people who had been bed-ridden for years as lively as crickets ! I, that are passed eighty, was a boy compared to them ! Long narrow tables with forms on each side to sit. Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom was a standing up to the table with one hand in his waistcoat pocket and the other holding a fork above his headâ\\x80\\x94 tongue-ing away with his eye shut ! The only eye that had weathered escapes. Susannah, Mrs Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom, she sat by his side, and kept a-pulling his coat tails to be seated as she said,â\\x80\\x94WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 241 â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ll get no vittles, if ye spend yerself in too much mouth speechâ\\x80\\x94even mountains of beef will melt away before the multitude as is hearty!â\\x80\\x99 So she say, â\\x80\\x98Co! co ! Tom Johnâ\\x80\\x99s Tom, ease ye off a bit, and mind yer vittles. But talk-ee he must, he would, he, no let about it.â\\x80\\x99 I was too much discoursing my own plate of vittles to mind much what he was talking about, but I heerd it was â\\x80\\x98 on the elder sons of history, from Cain downwards,â\\x80\\x99 well, even to Maister John Pencoose, aged three. Mar Teazer Pearce said,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 I never knew they was sich a parcel of wicked ones the elder sons.â\\x80\\x99 But before that day drew to an end Mar Teazer Pearce and I had a fine come outâ\\x80\\x94and of course â\\x80\\x99twas over her Sprigginâ\\x80\\x99s chield Wil-ly-am Teazer Pearce. However, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll first talk about the gentry. First, there was Miss Fanny, begging her pardon, Mrs Johnnie Pencoose, looking hand 172 somer than ever, and as happy as ever she was as chield and romping girl, school miss and fine young lady ! She laugh and talk with242 IN A CORNISH TOWNSHIP all, and her voice was like a carol full of lifeâ\\x80\\x94 and how proud she was of her boy heaved up before the Maister on the saddle, on the good strawberry mare, Viâ\\x80\\x99letâ\\x80\\x94and Missus, in a twitter, with her best bunnet strings tied above her head, out of the way, in serving the old people. Here I must tell ye the misadventure, all brought about by that Sprigginâ\\x80\\x99s chield ! No, you would not believe it, and he only turned five and a halfâ\\x80\\x94as Betsy Reel say, â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x99Twas more than wicked, â\\x80\\x99twere ridic-cu-lous sich an uncoo deed â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94as showâ\\x80\\x99d plain he werenâ\\x80\\x99t all mortal this Sprigginâ\\x80\\x99s chield. He had gone and cobbler-waxed the form ; so there we was, when we come to have a regard to move, seatedâ\\x80\\x94our best Sunday garmentsâ\\x80\\x94the men groan, and the women squeal. We says one to another,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 What ever shall us do, as we wants to leave the table and look at the country dance to the top of the lawnâ\\x80\\x94what ever shall us do by it ? â\\x80\\x99 Says Woolly Woollaton,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 How many be us, be in this here quan 172 dary ? â\\x80\\x99WITH OLD VOGUE FOLK. 243 â\\x80\\x98 Nigh upon a score,â\\x80\\x99 says I, â\\x80\\x98counting men and women.â\\x80\\x99 Says Woolly,â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98We must all march to once, and carry the form â\\x80\\x99long with us ; â\\x80\\x99 and so we did, and finely divarted the rest of the company. â\\x80\\x99Twas best to take it as a joke, but I do believe it would have been murder if I had seeâ\\x80\\x99d that Sprigginâ\\x80\\x99s chield Wil-ly-am Teazer Pearce. After it come out that the bass viol of the church quire, Mick Fuggler had come provided with a big bit of cobblerâ\\x80\\x99s wax to wax his viol strings, or big fiddle, as you like, and â\\x80\\x99twas a big bit of cobblerâ\\x80\\x99s wax, as, being a shoe 172 maker, he had no need to spare. And Woolly Woollaton says he seeâ\\x80\\x99d that Sprigginâ\\x80\\x99s chield a- busyâ\\x80\\x94whishâ\\x80\\x94washing, as ye do groom a horse, if he werenâ\\x80\\x99t a-waxing that form from end to endâ\\x80\\x94but moreâ\\x80\\x99s the pity he took no heed to him what he was a-doing. So if the auld wizards and witches are dying out of the land there is still greater torment a-springing up in the worldâ\\x80\\x94a generation of Sprigginâ\\x80\\x99s chields. THE END.',\n",

I suppose there has scarcely ever been any large house 172 hold, at any period of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s history, so fortunate as not to possess one mauvais sujetâ\\x80\\x94one Disgrace to the Family : there have been households, such as Jacobâ\\x80\\x99s of old, wherein there have been ten Disgraces to two Credits, but that was an exceptional case. I speak within bounds, therefore, when I make use of the words of Mr. Wadsworth Longfellowâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9c There is no flock, however watched and tended, But one Blade Sheep is there ; There is no fireside, howeâ\\x80\\x99er defended, But hath one vacant chair,â\\x80\\x9d about whose should-be occupant there is a silence in the domestic circle, and only an unpleasant whisper else 172 where. Like many other whispers, however, this circu 172 lates much more universally than any outspoken report.2 RICHARD ARBOUK ; OR, Tlie name which we become most familiar with when we have made the acquaintance of his brethren â\\x80\\x94 and often enough before we have made itâ\\x80\\x94is poor Dickâ\\x80\\x99s. The Disgrace to the Family is generally a Dick. God 172 fathers and godmothers in oneâ\\x80\\x99s baptism should look to this. Tom, too, is rather a dangerous sort of name to give a lad; but Alexander is safe enough; and as for Jamesâ\\x80\\x94I never even so much as heard of a James going wrong, except in the Stuart family. Nobody ever calls Dick, Eichardâ\\x80\\x94that is, â\\x80\\x9cnot since it happened, you knowâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94except his mother. â\\x80\\x9c My poor dear Eichard,â\\x80\\x9d she says, when she speaks of him at rare times to his earthly father, and at all times when she prays for him, as she does continuaEy, to his Father which is in Heaven. Dick has all the world against him except his mother and me. I always did like Dick, and always shall ; a weakness whichâ\\x80\\x94being a James myself, and out of the reach of any possible sympathy with the young repro 172 bateâ\\x80\\x94is not a little creditable. â\\x80\\x9c Well,â\\x80\\x9d say I, to the friends of the family, â\\x80\\x9c since you are always saying, â\\x80\\x98 1 Ie was bom bad, you see;â\\x80\\x99 and as I know that he had a bad name given to him at the baptismal font, would it not have been flying in the face of Predestination, if he had not â\\x80\\x98turned out badâ\\x80\\x99 also? Why, of course it would.â\\x80\\x9d Although people talk about â\\x80\\x9c It,â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9c That bad business,â\\x80\\x9d it must be confessed that the youth is not often made a castaway for his first fault. His usual course is to commit a long list of misdemeanours, culmi 172 nating in some offence, which, although serious, wouldTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 3 not of itself have placed him outside the pale of forgive 172 ness. I have known a young gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s character to be irreproachable up to the age of fourteen years, at which epoch he committed an atrocious and unextenua 172 ted child-murder ; but he was not a favourite of mine either before or after that event, and his Christian name (or what is accustomed to pass for such in Wales, his native country) was Cadwallader. He, however, be pleased to observe, was by no means a Black Sheep â\\x80\\x94 which may, after all, be merely a healthy variety of the speciesâ\\x80\\x94but one that had an evil disease in him, fatal to all his kindâ\\x80\\x94the Rot ; not in the foot, indeed, as in the quadrupedâ\\x80\\x99s case, but at his heart. The Black Sheep proper (which, however, is an adjec 172 tive but rarely applicable to him) is often only black outside ; of an external appearance obviously objection 172 able indeed, but, within, very tolerable mutton. I have in my time known not a few of these unfor 172 tunates, and my kindliness towards them, has led several (they being confiding creatures, who always wear their hearts upon their sleeves, of which circumstance the daws take great advantage) to reveal to me the history of their lives. Out of which several narratives I am about to compile the following biography, for the good of my species (as well as for other reasons which need not be here set down) ; just as the warning beacon-fire, lit upon some wave-fretted promontory on stormy nights, is not made up of a single tree, marked from the first for such a purpose by the cruel axe, but out of many. If, in one single bark, bearing full sail upon the fatal4 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, breakers, the careless steersman shall perceive its flame, and seize the flapping helm while there is time, thereby preserving ship and cargo, it will be well indeed : but if, evoked by this tiny danger-signal, one life-boat, that would else have lain securely in harbour, be induced to put out to the driving vessel, and give her aid, ere she become an utter wreck, it will be better still. A little help is often all she needs, although she looks in such a sad plight to us, on land. And for endeavour of this sort, be sure, whether it succeed or not, the rescuer may count for certain on one day getting salvage.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 5 CHAPTER THE FIRST. A FAMILY GROUP. Richard Arbour was the fifth child and the third son of parents who considered their quiver sufficiently stocked with that sort of missile before his advent, which, more 172 over, occurred somewhat unexpectedly. The wind of a not particularly joyful dawn blew free in the silken sail of his infancy, three weeks or so before that little shallop was expected upon the great ocean of life. The hypocrisy of â\\x80\\x9c Welcome, Little Stranger,â\\x80\\x9d would not perhaps have been inscribed upon his pincushion, no matter what notice of his arrival might have been vouchsafed before 172 hand, but, as it was, there were absolutely not enough pins ; there was a total insufficiency of flannel : and, as for his cradle, it was a something knocked up out of his eldest brotherâ\\x80\\x99s wheel-barrow (who never forgave that appropriation of his property), and looked, even when it was fitted up, and en grande tenue, a great deal more like an Indian â\\x80\\x9ctikiniganâ\\x80\\x9d than a Christian bassinette. His mother, poor thing, was glad perhaps to look upon his little mottled carcass ; but nobody who had met his papa at 2 A.M. on that gusty December morning at the(; EICHAED AKBOUE ; OE, doctorâ\\x80\\x99s door, with liis sillc umbrella blown inside out, and one shoe and one slipper on, would have dreamed of congratulating him. How differently does Paterfamilias treat the first and fifth of these post-nuptial incidents! In the former case â\\x80\\x9cour medical man,â\\x80\\x9d not yet become â\\x80\\x9cour family doctor,â\\x80\\x9d is warned to keep himself from distant journeys, in anticipation of the important event ; while that awful woman with the bundleâ\\x80\\x94for we never yet saw one of her class with box or bagâ\\x80\\x94is welcomed into the house, like the monster horse into Troy, bringing subjugation and desolation with her for weeks and weeks before it is absolutely necessary. Then the husbandâ\\x80\\x94not yet Head of the Familyâ\\x80\\x94banished once more into Bachelor- dom and a turn-up bedstead, starts up oâ\\x80\\x99 nights with night-cap behind ear, and thinks he is wanted to fetch Dr. Babbicombe a score of times before the real occasion, which commonly takes place when he is out of the way ; spending an hour, perhaps, with some friend of his youth, and a cigarâ\\x80\\x94an accident which afflicts the new- made father with the acutest pangs of conscience. But when such an affair has happened four times already, Paterfamilias takes it quieter a good deal; doesnâ\\x80\\x99t see any particular cause for hurry ; declines to devote his mansion to Lucina until the last extremity ; and (as we have seen) has eventually not even time to select his shoes of swiftness. Mr. Benjamin Arbour was a tender-hearted husband, too, and in his ardent anxiety, scarcely felt the cold at all until lie had reached home again, when getting intoTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. t a damp bed in the attic chamberâ\\x80\\x94for there was no fire for him to sit up by anywhere, except where his presence was forbiddenâ\\x80\\x94he became conscious that, as a gentleman subject to spitting of blood from the lungs, he had not been doing an entirely prudent thing. His teeth chat 172 tered so when Dr. Babbicombe came up to tell him the news, that that physician ascribed the phenomenon to marital anxiety, and at once hastened to allay it. â\\x80\\x9c Itâ\\x80\\x99s all right, Mr. Arbour,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed he, cheerfully ; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s all right, and it isnâ\\x80\\x99t twins.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Is it a hub-bub-bub-bub ?â\\x80\\x9d inquired the father, as though his teeth were castanets. â\\x80\\x9c Yes, itâ\\x80\\x99s a boy,â\\x80\\x9d replied the doctor, in a tone of commiseration. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s just like my luck,â\\x80\\x9d quoth the disgusted parent: â\\x80\\x9cthey cost just twice as much as girls, and I have to teach â\\x80\\x99em.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Benjamin Arbour might have spared himself this last reflection, for he was not fated to become tutor to his fifth offspring at all. The damp attic and the slippered foot together were too much for the poor gentleman, and he was carried off by consumption within a few weeks of the birth of his third boy. Our hero may therefore be said to have commenced his career in this world by committing parricide. That was the view his eldest brother and sisterâ\\x80\\x94Adolphus and Mariaâ\\x80\\x94always took of it. These were not nice young people. Adolphus liad an enormous mouth, without any lips, sandy hair, sandy whisk but that is anticipating mattersâ\\x80\\x94whity-brown complexion, and8 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, green eyes; or, at least, one of them was a good deal more green than hazel. Maria had black hair and a yellow skin, but she had one mind in common with her brother, and therefore it may be easily imagined that they were not very well provided in that respect. We are but too often apt to speak of personsâ\\x80\\x99 minds as being â\\x80\\x9c bad,â\\x80\\x9d when the more applicable term by far would be â\\x80\\x9cincomplete.â\\x80\\x9d Our young friends above alluded to possessed several mental gifts : the talents for getting and for keeping; determination, perseverance, and (in par 172 ticular) humility to their social superiors ; while their prudence was so remarkable, that although the bump of that organ must have been tremendous (if the science of phrenology is worth a momentâ\\x80\\x99s attention) on both their heads, they concealed all evidence of the matter from the outward world. Some other virtues howeverâ\\x80\\x94not without value in many eyesâ\\x80\\x94were, as it is written in the Modern Athens, quite â\\x80\\x9c amissing ;â\\x80\\x9d especially those connected with the affections, which were in their case confined to that powerful passion which some philoso 172 phers assert to be the motive cause of all good worksâ\\x80\\x94 namely, Self-love. It may, we are aware, be urged, that these matters should be artistically made to disclose themselves during the course of this history, but we think that in so doing we should treat our public very scurvily ; for would it be right to suffer these two persons, throughout I donâ\\x80\\x99t yet know how many chapters, to impose upon them, just as they tricked the world, until the very last, in actual life ? No. No Header, however Gentle, would endure, after so many weeks of prostrateTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 9 adoration of these idols, to he informed that their feet were, after all, hut of the commonest clay, and (by a too obvious corollary) that he himself had been but a benighted worshipper. Johnnie Arbour, the second hoy, with his apple- cheeks and beady eyes, was a good-natured lad enough â\\x80\\x94so long as you did not vex him. He would never covet nor desire another boyâ\\x80\\x99s toys, nor permit another boy to get beyond coveting his. Having considerable independence of character, and not being desirous of a playmateâ\\x80\\x94brother Dolly, perhaps having given him an unfavourable opinion of that sort of articleâ\\x80\\x94he had not been anxious for the new arrival; but since he had made his appearance, he was prepared to put up with him, as with the multiplication table, stale bread on Monday mornings, the transitory nature of lollipops, or any other necessary evil. But Margaret, â\\x80\\x9c rare pale Margaret,â\\x80\\x9d our Maggie, everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s Maggie (Ah, how Dickâ\\x80\\x99s manner used to change when he spoke to us of her and of his mother ! No angry scorn about him then, and with the voice that had grown hoarse with paying back scorn for scorn to half the world, become as soft and gentle as a womanâ\\x80\\x99s !) â\\x80\\x94Maggie, we say, hailed â\\x80\\x9cittle buddyâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x9d advent with rapture, holding it highest treat to stand afar off and see him in his tubâ\\x80\\x94poor papaâ\\x80\\x99s foot-bathâ\\x80\\x94or to be suffered to delicately dint his cheek with her tiny linger. Maggie was frail as a lily, and almost as white ; but if any mortal creature, from King Herod to a sausage-maker, had threatened to harm that baby, she10 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, would have drawn bodkin, and done battle to the death.

FATHERLESS. It lias been suggested to us that while mentioning some characteristics of the Arbour family, we have yet been guilty of a very serious omission. For all that has been told at present, they may have belonged to one of the vulgarest classes of society, and consequently have been altogether beneath humanâ\\x80\\x94that is to say, properly constituted humanâ\\x80\\x94interest. Let us hasten, therefore, to set this matter in its correct light while there is yet time. At the risk, and indeed the certainty, of cutting off electrical relations with a considerable number of readers, whose sensibilities we have no desire to shock, and whose well-cultivated hair we would on no account cause to stand 011 end by bringing them face to face with persons of â\\x80\\x9c small meansâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94at the risk, we repeat, of diminishing our audience by emptying the Dress-circle and the Stalls at the very outset, we confess, once for all, that the Arbours were not and never had been â\\x80\\x9c carriage people.â\\x80\\x9d But on the other hand, ladies and gentlemen of the Pit and Galleries, neither were they merely â\\x80\\x9cgenteelâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9crespectable.â\\x80\\x9d The Arbours were12 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, a round or two in the social ladder above you, 0 middle classes ! and therefore, as we conclude, not by any means unworthy of your interest and sympathy. Mr. Benjamin Arbour, now struggling hopelessly with consumption, was in the receipt of five hundred a year or so ; but that income, was alas ! so peculiarly his own that it ceased with his life. He filled also a per 172 haps responsible and certainly mysterious office com 172 mitted to him by the government of his native country. He was an Authorised Commissioner for witnessing the Deeds of Married Women. Whether the duties of this post are, in reality, so disgracefully inquisitorial as its name would imply, we do not know, but we may be certain that Mr. Arbour had his consortâ\\x80\\x99s full permis 172 sion to discharge them. He had had probably about as few secrets intrusted to him throughout his life as any 172 bodyâ\\x80\\x94for men, composed one half of quicksilver and the other half of the milk of human kindness, are known to be but indifferent repositories for such things _ â\\x80\\x94and he had certainly never had a single secret from his wife. They had been married nearly fifteen years, and nevertheless could scarcely be termed middle-aged people. It would be no exaggeration to say that until now, when he found himself dying, he had never once seriously regretted the having wedded Letitia Banks. The imprudent Boy and Girl, as they had been called, had been very happy together for those three lustrums, in spite of all good-natured prophecies to the contrary. Ingram Arbour, the merchantâ\\x80\\x94elder and only brother to Benjaminâ\\x80\\x94had even predicted their finalTHE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 13 settlement in the workhouse of their native district in Devonshire, and he was a man who had a reputation for judgment too. He also had been left a life-interest in a sum of money which secured him five hundred a year, and perhaps possessed it stillâ\\x80\\x94unless it had been advantageously disposed ofâ\\x80\\x94but that was a mere nothing in comparison with his present possessions. He had not found himself hampered with a wife and family in the second holidays after he had left school. He had not bought a cottage â\\x80\\x94the one redeeming cir 172 cumstance connected with which in his eyes, was, that it was on the bank of a river, which might perhaps afford accidental provision for surplus childrenâ\\x80\\x94nor buried himself in the country, like a talent laid up in a napkin, accumulating nothing but small-change. It was the contemplation of that small-change that chiefly troubled poor Benjamin now, and made him almost wish that he had remained a bachelor. He had faith in a good Providence, and did not doubt that a Raven of some sort would be sent to feed those hungry mouths ; but he would certainly have preferred to have felt him 172 self more deeply connected with the Eagle. That was the name of the Assurance Office from w T hich one thousand pounds would be due to the family after his death, besides which there were two thousand pounds of Leetyâ\\x80\\x99s own, and that was all. â\\x80\\x9c I wish, dearest,â\\x80\\x9d gasped he, as she was smoothing his pillow upon the very last day that she ever liad that loving office to perform for himâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c I do so wish that it was more.â\\x80\\x9d He spoke so low that even the ear14 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, of love failed to catch liis meaning ; but Leety heard the word â\\x80\\x9cwish,â\\x80\\x9d and all her faculties were at once devoted to find out what this desire of the dying man might he. â\\x80\\x9cDo you wish to see our children, Benjy dear?â\\x80\\x9d She had called him by that fond title ever since that walk upon the purple Devon moorland far away and long ago, where they two had plighted their troth. What a miracle of strength and beauty he liad then seemed to her, and now this ghastly shadow was all that remained of him, itself about to flit into the dark 172 ness of Death ! Yet, be sure, he was never so dear to. her before. Not if she could have lived her life again, at that moment, would she have spent it otherwise as regarded that departing clay. She would have chosen no other than he though this end had been foreshewn from the beginning. Not one of the wretched minutes which yet remained to her to watch that still loving face would she have bartered for centuries of Paradise. â\\x80\\x9c Do you wish to see our children, Benjy, dear ? â\\x80\\x9d He neither spoke nor stirred, but his eyes, which were yet clear and even brilliant, and that watched her every motion replied: â\\x80\\x9cYes, dearest.â\\x80\\x9d Adolphus and Maria, Johnnie and Maggie, were marched in thereforeâ\\x80\\x94the two latter hand in hand, for they were smitten with vague terror, understanding only that that Something was impending whose coming had kept the house so still for weeks. But the eyes said ; â\\x80\\x9c There is yet another, Leety ;â\\x80\\x9d and No. 5 was trans 172 ferred from the nursery to his motherâ\\x80\\x99s arms, who forTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 15 this once, however, regarded him not, nor sealed his infant eyelids with her lips. The two eldest children were tall enough to lean over the bedside and salute for the last time their fatherâ\\x80\\x99s forehead ; an operation which they performed in a very rapid and energetic manner, much as a superstitious dealer at whist hastens to tap the trump card as soon as it is turned up, for luck. Johnnie, with his ruddy apple-face turned to the colour of a lemon, climbed up the bed, and said, â\\x80\\x9c Good-bye, father,â\\x80\\x9d in compliance with his motherâ\\x80\\x99s whisper, duti 172 fully enough. But little Maggie lay by her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s side in an agony of grief, and covered his grisly chin with tears and kisses. There was no need for any farewell between those two, who had been acting, saying, thinking nothing but farewells since Dr. Babbicombe had said in his firm, kind voice : â\\x80\\x9c I can do nothing further, my good friend, now, but pray for yon but as Leety stooped down over him to put her babyâ\\x80\\x99s cheek to his mouth, that he too in after-years might know that his father had kissed him, her husband, reminded by that action perhaps of that which had been oppressing his mind before, murmured once again : â\\x80\\x9c I wish, Leety, I do so wish that it was more.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c What does he mean % What does your father mean ?â\\x80\\x9d cried she appealingly, for nothing was more dis 172 tant from her own thoughts than that which was agitat 172 ing his. On this, Maria whispered something to Adolphus,16 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, and straightway that young gentleman observed, in spite of her evident reluctance to have her remark repeated : â\\x80\\x9c Please mamma, Maria thinks papa is wishing that he could leave us some more money.â\\x80\\x9d This young lady of ten years old did indeed possess a great sagacity, and even, as we have seen, considerable modesty in the exhibition of it ; and yet there was some 172 thing uncomfortably just in the remark which nurse Rachel subsequently made in the servantsâ\\x80\\x99 hall, when describing the above scene in her masterâ\\x80\\x99s death- chamber : â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Twas an odd thing for such a mere child to have been thinking of money, at a time like that, too !â\\x80\\x9d The above wish was the last idea that Mr. Arbour lived to express, and in a few more minutes there was no protector left to poor Leety and her offspring, save Him who makes the Widow and the Fatherless his peculiar care. The bereft devoted woman would not easily have been persuaded, perhaps, to leave that precious clayâ\\x80\\x94 would have watched by the casket half the night, though her jewel lay in the place where thieves break not through nor stealâ\\x80\\x94but that a tiny cry arose from No. 5, reminding her that there was a duty and a joy in this world yet. For a week, there was a silence throughout the cottage by the river, only broken by sad sounds. The clock ticked on the stairs more solemnly, as though it were discoursing upon matters graver than Time ; the stairs creaked under muffled footsteps ; the servantsTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 17 conversed in muffled tones. Once only a laugh broke forth from the kitchen, arising from some inadvertent domestic, and immediately reproved by a â\\x80\\x9cFor shame, Jane, donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember what has happened !â\\x80\\x9d and succeeded by tears ; and once a .prolonged and hearty howl issued from Master Johnnie, who had been veiy foolishly forbidden by nurse Eachael to spin his hum 172 ming-top, in consideration of the domestic calamity which had befallen him. After that weary week, the early summer sun again shone into that reopened chamber, as full of light and warmth as ever, though it seemed not so to her who lay upon the widowed bed, and the memory of the dead man faded fast away from every heart save one, as the dark 172 ness dwindles before the dawn. Another life had begun to fill the place of that which had departed, and to the end that it should do so worthily, they carried it in gorgeous cap and flowing linen, to abjure the pomps and vanities of the world at the baptismal font. In a word, No. 5, who had as yet been only registered, was chris 172 tened, and was namedâ\\x80\\x94as Steele, and Savage, and half the scapegraces of the world had been named before him â\\x80\\x94Richard, the long for Dick.18 EICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, CHAPTEE THE THIED. UNCLE INGRAM. Mr. Ingram Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s estimation of his sentimental brotherâ\\x80\\x99s prudence and sagacity had not been, as we have seen, a high one; and he had expressed an un 172 pleasant foreboding concerning that family, between whom and the workhouse of their native parish only some three thousand pounds did now in reality inter 172 vene : hut the astute merchant had miscalculated matters in one very important particular. He had taken it for granted that Benjamin, who was his junior by many years, would outlive him. He had prophesied future misfortunes with all the unction of a Metternich, under the comfortable impression that the Deluge would take place after his own time. But Benjamin being dead, Uncle Ingram w T as become the natural guardian of his widow and children ; a position which his sturdy sense of right caused him to accept at once and unsoli 172 cited. This respectable Christian merchant, therefore, found himself in a worse predicament than any of those ancient Jews whose piety compelled them to marry their childless sisters-in-law. He had to maintain Mrs.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 19 Benjamin Arbour without marrying her, as well as her children, from No. 1 to No. 5 inclusive. Except, there 172 fore, for his great reputation for caution, he might just as well have married when his brother did, and have begotten half-a-dozen children of his own. This reflection was scarcely a soothing one, even if Mr. Ingram Arbour had been capable of being soothed by a reflectionâ\\x80\\x94which he was not. He was a man who did his duty, but without, by any means, denying him 172 self the pleasure of grumbling at it. He would give, and largely, to whomsoever he judged to have a just claim upon him, but he could not be said to be a cheer 172 ful giver. Benevolence was with him a mere business transaction, effected out of office-hours, and any act of it had no more accompaniment of delicacy or kindness from him, than if it had been the discounting of a bill. He took things, in general, and prided himself in doing so, for â\\x80\\x9cwhat they were worthâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94by which he meant rather what they would â\\x80\\x9cfetch,â\\x80\\x9d if exposed for sale. He was not, in short, quite the man to be selected to say grace before an indifferent dinner, and far less after one; and that he openly thanked God for having blessed him in the basket and in the store, was the more praiseworthy, since he had a secret conviction that his success had been entirely owing to his own sagacity. Such was the man who was seated in the little drawing-room of Bose Cottage on a certain July evening after Dickâ\\x80\\x99s christening; and we are intro 172 duced to him at a most favourable time, for he had20 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, just clined, and dined well, and had within him a bottle of poor Benjyâ\\x80\\x99s best port, which the widow had carefully- selected for him. She had done so with no intention beyond that of hospitality, but Uncle Ingram was far too clever to believe it. â\\x80\\x9c Mrs. B. is not such a fool as she looks,â\\x80\\x9d was the doubtful compliment he had con 172 ferred in his own mind upon that lady; although he did not spurn the supposed medium of conciliation by any means. On the contrary, he had set the last glass of it between the light and his own eyes in an admiring manner, with various guttural noises expressive of approval, and only qualified a satisfactory smack of the lips when it was done, by muttering an anxious hope that his deceased brother had paid for it. After which, he had risen from the table, pulled up his shirt- collar, cleared his throat, in preparation for the business statement he was come down from town to enter upon, corrugated his eyebrows, in order to forbid contradiction, and joined his expectant sister-in-law in the drawing 172 room. This was a bow-windowed apartment, with the three sashes at present thrown openâ\\x80\\x94for it was a somewhat oppressive, though lovely eveningâ\\x80\\x94and the pleasant breeze from the river brought through them the beat of oars, from the frequent pleasure boats coming from or returning to the neighbouring town, and even the splash of the fish, as they leaped out of the smooth but rapid current. A little island, fringed with willows, immedi 172 ately fronted the cottage, hiding from it the main channel, the noise of whose passing barges and bargees cameTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. â\\x80¢21 mellowed and expurgated by distance ; while in the near stream, a punt lay moored, filled with quiet anglers; and three milk-white swans now pruned their feathers, and now exhibited themselves with their heads under water, and their opposite extremities, like gigantic lily- buds perpendicularly in air. In the foreground, six clean stone steps led from the mid-window to a sloping lawn, terminating in a wooden terrace, on which were some half-dozen flower-baskets full of red geraniums, and a sun-dial, curiously carved. It was a charming scene, but one which did not jar the less on that account 011 him who now beheld it. He did not see it for the first time, it is true, since he had more than once visited the cottageâ\\x80\\x94under protest, and always with sundry expressions of contempt for that fairy bower â\\x80\\x94but its quiet beauty had never struck him so deeply before. â\\x80\\x9c What right,â\\x80\\x9d thought he, â\\x80\\x9c had that brother of mine, with his large family and small income, to have such a place as this ? How much better it is than that great dingy house of my own in Golden Square. Those Hower-baskets must have cost a pretty penny when they were new, I reckon. If I had the right of fishing in this water, Iâ\\x80\\x99d startle those poaching vagabonds out in that punt there, pretty quick. That island must be worth something when it isnâ\\x80\\x99t under water, which it is six months of the year or so, I believe ; but itâ\\x80\\x99s no good asking Mrs. B. whether osiers are up or not just now, I daresay. If that swan has cygnets born upon it, I should like to know who claims, the proprietor of the land, or22 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, the London Company? I daresay, Benjamin never tried that question.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBrother Ingram,â\\x80\\x9d observed a musical hut melan 172 choly voice, breaking in upon these romantic medita 172 tions, â\\x80\\x9c will you take a cup of tea now, or will you smoke a cigar? You must not mind me, you know: my dear Benjy often used to smoke here in evenings such as this.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSo much the worse for him, madam,â\\x80\\x9d returned Ingram Arbour; â\\x80\\x9c I daresay he hastened his end by that deleterious practice. I am sure he helped to ruin him 172 self by itâ\\x80\\x94to ruin himself, madam.â\\x80\\x9d By the repetition of the word â\\x80\\x9c ruin,â\\x80\\x9d and by conjur 172 ing up before his mindâ\\x80\\x99s eye a vision of poverty and destitution, Mr. Arbour contrived to convince himself that he was behaving with a sternness only proportionate to the circumstances of the case ; just as one might call up the atrocities of Delhi or Cawnpore, to justify oneâ\\x80\\x99s self for committing an unprovoked assault upon a Hindu crossing-sweeper. The idea of impecuniosity always stirred Mr. Ingram Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s bile, just as that of cruelty or oppression arouses the indignation of less commercial persons. â\\x80\\x9c Why, good HeÃ\\xa0vens, madam,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, worked up into a sort of temporary jaundice by these judicious reflections, â\\x80\\x9c that man ought to have died worth five-and- twenty thousand pounds, if he had not been an idiot. That is to say, I mean,â\\x80\\x9d added he, observing a faint flush to rise in his sister-in-lawâ\\x80\\x99s cheeks, â\\x80\\x9c if he had not been so unbusiness-like and careless. It was not my affairTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 23 of course, and I always make it a point not to meddle with other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s af Hi, you fellows in that punt,â\\x80\\x9d roared Mr. Ingram Arbour, interrupting himself with a jerk, and approaching the window, â\\x80\\x9c how do you dare to use a net in this water, you poaching scoundrels? Upon my sacred word of honour, Mrs. Arbour, they are using a net !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Hush, Brother Ingram,â\\x80\\x9d entreated his sister-in-law ; â\\x80\\x9c pray, be quiet ; itâ\\x80\\x99s only a landing-net ; it is only to pull the fish up after they have been hooked.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t care what sort of a net it is,â\\x80\\x9d stormed the stickler for the rights of property ; â\\x80\\x9c the law says â\\x80\\x98 a net,â\\x80\\x99 and they have no right to use a butterfly net there with 172 out your permission. What is the scoundrel saying, madamâ\\x80\\x94the poacher in the white straw hat ? What is he saying in reply to my question ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t hear quite distinctly,â\\x80\\x9d replied the widow, biting lier lips ; â\\x80\\x9c but it is something about the Emperor of Morocco, I am afraid, and their most respectful com 172 pliments.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Then they are absolutely laughing at me,â\\x80\\x9d quoth Ingram Arbour, â\\x80\\x9c are they ? They have chosen me, of all men to be the subject of their senseless ribaldry. Will you kindly favour me with the name of one of those individuals, madam ? Any one will do.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know the person in the straw-hat, Brother Ingram,â\\x80\\x9d replied his sister-in-law with hesitation ; â\\x80\\x9c they are doubtless towns-people, who have taken the boat for the evening.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c You know the fishermanâ\\x80\\x94the man who owns theRICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, boat,â\\x80\\x9d returned the other stubbornly. â\\x80\\x9cI must have that fishermanâ\\x80\\x99s name, if you please, and at once.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c It was not his fault, brother,â\\x80\\x9d urged the widow pleadingly ; â\\x80\\x9c lie could not prevent the persons who had employed him from being impertinent; he is a very wel 1-conducted â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c One moment, if you please,â\\x80\\x9d replied her brother-in- law, interrupting her curtly. â\\x80\\x9c Come here, Adolphus : I want to speak to you.â\\x80\\x9d The boy was ducking his brother and sisters with the garden-engine, but desisted from that occupation, and came obedient to his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s call, with downcast eyes. â\\x80\\x9cPlease, sir, it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t me began it,â\\x80\\x9d whined he, in a deprecating voice ; â\\x80\\x9cit was Johnnie and Maria, especially Johnnie.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a lie,â\\x80\\x9d returned Uncle Ingram with composure, â\\x80\\x9c for Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been watching you : and, mind you, never tell me a lie again. Who is that fisherman yonder, and where does he live ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c His name is John Wilson, and he lives in our cot 172 tage down the stream yonder.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c A very hard-working honest fellow, with a large family,â\\x80\\x9d added Mrs. Arbour. â\\x80\\x9cBut he ainâ\\x80\\x99t paid his rent, you know, mother,â\\x80\\x9d observed Adolphus, cunningly; â\\x80\\x9cbecause I heard you tell him yesterday that next month would do.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a sharp lad,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Uncle Ingram approvingly ; â\\x80\\x9c the proof of the pudding is in the eating, is it not, hoy ? You may go away now, for your motherTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 25 and I are going to have some talkâ\\x80\\x94that is to say, if it be agreeable to you, Letitia ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMy ears are at your service, brother, to receive whatever you may please to say ; but I have little to tell you, I fancy, which you do not already know.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I know a few things relating to practical matters;â\\x80\\x9d returned the other, with a little mollification of manner ; â\\x80\\x9c and I generally manage to obtain what information I am in want of;â\\x80\\x9d and he entered the name of John Wilson into his pocket-book, and shut the clasp with a snap. â\\x80\\x9c Now, then, to business, madam. One thousand insurance, and two thousand in the three per cents is, I believe, the total figure which represents your property â\\x80\\x94all in the world which you and your children have to look toâ\\x80\\x94with the exception of this cottage and garden, yonder island, and right of fishing (Iâ\\x80\\x99ll net them, the scoundrels, as sure as my name is Ingram Arbour), and the cottage of that man Wilson (Iâ\\x80\\x99ll cottage him, I reckon, in a manner that shall astonish him), with three or four hundred feet of osier-bank thereto appertaining.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c That, I believe, is all, brother.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Excuse me ; you do nâ\\x80\\x99t believe it ; youâ\\x80\\x99re sure of it. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing like positive certainty in matters of this kind. You are sure that this is all that lies between you and the Well, you may thank your stars that there was but one fool in my family ! If I died to-morrow, there would be something like ten times this beggarly pittance for my widow; that is to say, if I had been weak enough to leave one. Now, I dare say, you think me an unsympathising bear, madamâ\\x80\\x94a rude, mer-26 RICHARD arbour; or, cantile old hunks, without the least generous or charitable feelings about him. Now, donâ\\x80\\x99t say you donâ\\x80\\x99t, Letitia, because I know you do. I say you would much rather see me dead and well â\\x80\\x9c cut up,â\\x80\\x9d with my money neatly divided among my nephews and nieces, than sitting here, with my feet upon your sofa, giving you unpalatable advice; and you neednâ\\x80\\x99t say you donâ\\x80\\x99t, because such a remark would not impress me with an idea of your good sense or veracity. Well, notwithstanding all this, you will find me behave as handsomely, perhaps, in the main, and practically, madamâ\\x80\\x94\\'practicallyâ\\x80\\x94as any sen 172 timental benevolence-monger of your or any other womanâ\\x80\\x99s acquaintance. I am come down here expressly to accept the guardianship of yourself and your family.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cGod bless you, Brother Ingram,â\\x80\\x9d murmured the widow tremulously. â\\x80\\x9c My dearest Benjv always told me â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThen if he did madam,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the other, â\\x80\\x9c although I do not know what he told you in this particular instance, take my advice, and forget it from this moment, Benjamin was not the sort of man to make observations to be remembered. The chances are fifty to one that the. remark which you were about to repeat is destitute of practical truth.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c He always told me, I was going to say, brother, that you had a good heart at bottom, although you took a strange pleasure in concealing the fact from your fellow-creatures.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Then all I can say, madam, is,â\\x80\\x9d replied the un 172 abashed merchant, â\\x80\\x9c that such a statement of your lateTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 27 husband regarding me was a most unwarrantable imper 172 tinence. However, what I have got to say is this ; These children of yours must not be brought up in idle 172 ness. You must be content to live in a style quite different from that to which you have been hitherto accustomed. I daresay, you will think it very hard if I say, you must leave this cottage, this scene, these com 172 forts, and exchange them for indifferent quartersâ\\x80\\x94in the neighbourhood of Golden Square, for instance.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I am prepared for any sacrifice, Brother Ingram.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Sacrifice ! madamâ\\x80\\x94why the womanâ\\x80\\x99s mad \\'â\\x80\\x94I speak of a necessity. When starvation looks in at the window, and the sheriffâ\\x80\\x99s officer comes to the back-door, the debtor is not said to make a sacrifice, I reckon, although his goods are generally sold at one.â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Benjamin Arbour was not in sufficiently good spirits to appreciate this jeu dâ\\x80\\x99esp\\'il as it deserved, but her brother-in-law enjoyed it hugely. When dull men do make a joke, however feeble, they are not apt to let it escape in a hurry, but mouth it about as a child does a lollipop, until the observers are sometimes a little sick of the exhibition ; but, on the other hand, its effect is mollifying to the dull man. Mr. Ingram Arbour was positively charmed with this bon mot of his, which was not the firstâ\\x80\\x94by oneâ\\x80\\x94which he had indulged in for the last five-and-forty years. â\\x80\\x9cYou know goods are said to be sold at a tremen 172 dous sacrifice,â\\x80\\x9d observed he in explanation. Whereat Mrs. Benjamin, good lying woman, affected to see the matter in its proper humorous light, and23 KICHAED ARBOUR ; OR, laughed after a fashion that nature doubtless resented bitterly. â\\x80\\x9c What I was going to say,â\\x80\\x9d continued she, â\\x80\\x9c was, that I would leave the cottage to-morrow, if you thought it right or expedient that I should do so, Brother Ingram ; although, of course, the memories and associations that hang around this placeâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94-â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cWell, madam, for my part,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the mer 172 chant, â\\x80\\x9c I only believe in those sort of fixtures of which the house-agent can make some valuation. It may or may not be as you say ; but these sofas are better than horse-hair ones, and it is pleasanter to be your own mistress than at the mercy of some drunken lodging- liousekeeper anyway. Therefore, I say, stop at Rose Cottage if you will, madam, and keep your girls and younger boys about you. Nay, Letitia, I want no thanks ; and, indeed, you might have stopped here without my permission, as far as that goes, until your three thousand pounds had dwindled away to nothing. However, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see that that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t happen, if youâ\\x80\\x99ll only leave matters entirely in my hands. Adolphus shall re 172 turn to town with me, and begin work in my office at once ; and the other boys may follow him in timeâ\\x80\\x94if you are not too proud, that is, to permit the young gen 172 tlemen to engage in mercantile pursuits. You have a hundred a year of your own to spend, mind, and if your outgoings should come to double that sum, or even a little over, I will pay the surplus, Letitiaâ\\x80\\x94as your nearest relative and natural protector.â\\x80\\x94.out of my own pocket. Nay, madam, I am not a guardian angel, nor,THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 29 as I should imagine, anything like it, and I tell you honestly that I had much rather that every person should support his own wife and children, by personal exertions when alive, and by bequest after his death ; but, however others have neglected tlieir duty, madam, you will not find me shirk mine.â\\x80\\x9d It may be easily imagined that the widow gratefully accepted this proposition, and gladly intrusted to Mr. Ingram Arbour the treasurership of her little fortune and the control of her affairs. This matter finished, her brother-in-law was proceeding to give her his views concerning the management of her household, which, as emanating from a bachelor who liad been under the conduct of housekeepers for a quarter of a century, would doubtless have proved original and interesting in a high degree, when he became suddenly conscious that the attention of Mrs. Benjamin Arbourâ\\x80\\x94in spite of the engrossing nature of the topicâ\\x80\\x94had wandered some 172 where else. â\\x80\\x9c Doubtless, madam,â\\x80\\x9d he interposed, with an offended air, â\\x80\\x9c you know your own affairs best, and perhaps after all, I have been only officious in meddling with them ; but I do think some little outward respect, some sem 172 blance of attention, is due â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Dear good Brother Ingram,â\\x80\\x9d cried poor Mrs. Arbour, clasping her hands in terror, but still with an air of distracted preoccupation, â\\x80\\x9c I meant no disrespect to you, our benefactor, Heaven knows ; but I thought I heard my poor dear Dicky calling for his food.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c And is it possible,â\\x80\\x9d broke forth Mr. Ingram Arbour,30 EICHAED ARBOUR; OR, in a passion, â\\x80\\x9c that what I have to say, madam, upon any subject, can be of less consequence than your con 172 founded canary and his chickweed !â\\x80\\x9d \\' â\\x80\\x9c Canary, brother ! chickweed ! why itâ\\x80\\x99s my poor little Dick wanting his mamma. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you hear him setting up his tiny cry ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Since you call my attention to it madam,â\\x80\\x9d growled the affectionate uncle, â\\x80\\x9c I am sorry to say I do. But what on earth did you give it such a name as Dick for ? Luckily, we have got through all our more important business, or I do not doubt you would have left me for that little brat at any time ; as he grows older he must, however, be taught to wait for his betters.â\\x80\\x94By the by, Letitia,â\\x80\\x9d added Mr. Ingram, as his sister-in-law was leaving the room, â\\x80\\x9csince you have given me the control of your affairs, remember that that man Wilson leaves his cottage if his rent is delayed one hour beyond the 31st of next month. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll Emperor of Morocco him, trust me !â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 31 CHAPTER THE FOURTH. A COMMERCIAL ACADEMY. From babyhood to childhood, Dicky Arbour grew up the pet of the Rose Cottage household, and that notwith 172 standing what Nurse Rachel was wont to designate his â\\x80\\x9c little tantrums.â\\x80\\x9d He was accustomed when provoked â\\x80\\x94from the age of two till four or thereaboutsâ\\x80\\x94to stiffen himself out like a ramrod, cast himself backwards upon the floor, without the least regard for the shock that was thereby inflicted upon his youthful head, and, in that recumbent position, to scream like a locomotive. The best cure for this malady was found to be the giving him a very soft and comfortable pillow to lie upon, and treat 172 ing him, in all respects, like an elderly invalid of irritable temperament. He would then presently get up, toddle to his mother, and, hiding his curly head in her lap, observe in smothered tones : â\\x80\\x9c Me so torry, mammy; me dood now: me wonâ\\x80\\x99t do it never no more; me wonâ\\x80\\x99t indeed.â\\x80\\x9d Everybody saidâ\\x80\\x94save Sister Maria, who merely observed that he wanted whipping, and Brother Johnnie, who never expressed an opinion upon any subject un-32 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, connected with himselfâ\\x80\\x94that Dicky was a charming child, and only required a little management. Doctor Babbicombe in particularâ\\x80\\x94who had been pressed into being his godpapa, since the vein of natural and kindred sponsors had long been exhausted in the Arbour family â\\x80\\x94took vast delight in him, and taught him many things which his mother would scarcely have thought of. From his dictation, the infant pupil learned to express astonishment and admiration in such terms as, â\\x80\\x9c 0 my doodney ! â\\x80\\x9d (for, 0 my goodness !), â\\x80\\x9c Id nâ\\x80\\x99t it dolly ?â\\x80\\x9d (for, Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it jolly?), and â\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80\\x99s a bessie dark, upon my orror !â\\x80\\x9d (for, Hereâ\\x80\\x99s a blessed lark, upon my honour !) At which lisping wickednesses, mamma would hold up her finger reprovingly, and look supernaturally solemn, till the offending party destroyed her gravity by recom 172 mending Doctor Babbicombe for corporal punishment instead of himself. â\\x80\\x9c Ip my naughty godpa, mammy ; donâ\\x80\\x99t ip me.â\\x80\\x9d In due course arrived that dark hour, inevitable, as it seems, to civilised childhood, when the government of love is superseded by that of fear, and home and friends are left for school and strangers. Dickâ\\x80\\x94whose know 172 ledge of foreign languages had been confined to a little French, laid on upon him so lovingly and lightly by Sister Maggie, that it was rather like French polishâ\\x80\\x94was not sent to the same seminary where Adolphus had had his mind ennobled and refined by the rudiments of classical literature, hut to the commercial academy of Messrs. Dot and Carriwun, of which Johnnie had been already an alumnus for several years. In establish-THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 33 meats of the former class, the As in prcesenti is perhaps the most hateful task that is imposed upon a reasonable boy, while in those of the latter the abominable rule called Practice distracts the youthful mind most pain 172 fully, Well sings the Poet of Educational Life : Multiplication is vexation ; Addition is as badâ\\x80\\x94 for although the second statement is an exaggerated one, it is obviously only introduced with an eye to the final line, wherein lies the whole gist of the stanza : The Rule of Three does puzzle me ; But Practice drives me mad ! It almost drove poor Dick mad, and certainly set him violently against the profession to which such a stumb 172 ling-block was declared to he a necessary step. He would sit and suck the sponge which was attached like a horrid parasite to every slate, for hours, dreaming of his mother or foot-ball, until the cane of the wrathful pedagogue would awaken him to the real miseries of his situationâ\\x80\\x94to life and aliquot parts. This â\\x80\\x9cPracticeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 which never made Dick perfectâ\\x80\\x94is certainly worse than the _ds in prcesenti, which there is no absolute necessity to understand at all. The scratch and spurt of pens, too, that pervade the school-room devoted to the more liberal studies are far less offensive, than that perpetual grind of the slate-pencils, which, greasy with tears and perspiration, have to be sharpened with the knife con 172 tinually, an operation which they resent with hideous screeches. There was another method of doing this which Dick much preferred, since it was an excuse for.34 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, leaving his workâ\\x80\\x94retiring from Practiceâ\\x80\\x94and approach 172 ing the fire in cold weather : he would spit upon the end of his pencil and grind it upon the hearthstone with much persistency, until it acquired the finest possible point ; when it would break off suddenly, and then he would begin again. What noises, what smells, what an atmosphere filled that entrance-chamber of Commercial Learning, and what a splendid vision to many young minds must have been the Junior Clerkâ\\x80\\x99s office that would one day receive them into its bosom, where the pedagogue ceases from troubling, and the lazy read their newspapers, for ever, over pots of half and half ! Viewed from a mercantile point of view Eichard Arbour was rather a lazy boy, it must be confessed ; but beheld from the loftier elevation of Muscular Chris 172 tianity, he was diligent and assiduous in a very high degree. If the playtime of boysâ\\x80\\x94as is the modern faithâ\\x80\\x94is of equal consequence with their schooltime, there was certainly nobody who made a more profitable use of his than Dick. He was the most distinguished foot-ball player, for his height and weight, in the estab 172 lishment, and the most dreaded by the foe ; for, as in medieval warfare, the very noblest knights in armour of purest gold were liable to be miserably discomfited by half-naked wretches who would creep under their horsesâ\\x80\\x99 bellies and stab them, so the tallest of his opponents were not seldom hurled to earth by this pigmy in 172 serting himself between their legs. Moreover, as the aforesaid canaille perilled life and limb (although, becauseTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 35 they were not high-born, the snobbish chroniclers of the time make light of that circumstance) at least as much as the mailed knights, so Dicky Arbour would reck 172 lessly cast himself down, like some Juggernaut devotee, between the ball and any Titanic foe who was about to take a good high kick at it, and receive the iron compli 172 ment in his own ribs. This is a species of devotion rarely appreciated except by oneâ\\x80\\x99s own side. â\\x80\\x9c The ranks of Tuscanyâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94for school-boys are not a generous- hearted race by any meansâ\\x80\\x94not only â\\x80\\x9c forbear to cheerâ\\x80\\x9d such acts, but sometimes cherish an ignoble spite against the heroic little Koman. Thus, Mr. William Dempsey, a young man of seven 172 teen, and the captain, upon a certain occasion, of the opposite party, took it very ill that he was not only balked of his kick, but toppled headlong all his five feet eleven of length by the intrepid and horizontal Dick. When the battle was over, and nothing beyond a little brown paper and vinegar ought to have been required by a magnanimous foe, the heart of Dempsey desired vengeance, and his hand (in a quiet way, and with no reference to football, of course) was not slow to take it upon the very first opportunity. This tyrannical con 172 duct was resented by poor Dick, by deeds, which, measured by the indignant feelings of the doer, were tremendous, but which, physically considered, did not much hurt Dempsey, and only provoked further cruelties ; and by words of the most outrageous character, which were overheard (easily enoughâ\\x80\\x94for Dick had the best of lungs) by the schoolmaster, and3G RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, procured him a sound caning. This second wrong (as Dick considered it) smote the victim in a more sensitive part than that on which the mere blows had descended. The unfortunate lad had not a logical mindâ\\x80\\x94as we have seen in his difficulty of dealing with aliquot parts â\\x80\\x94and was, moreover, too amply provided with the savage instinct called Sense of Justice, which, in the case of No. 5 of a poor family, is not a gift which a good-natured fairy would bring to a baptism. It seemed to him, because Mr. Carriwun had caned him for swearing without inquiry into the previous circumstances, which were such as to have made a saint swear, as poor Dick thoughtâ\\x80\\x94who knew less about saints than if he had been brought up at Eton, where they are greatly revered, and produce half-holidays â\\x80\\x94 that authority was arrayed upon the side of tyranny, and perhaps even that it was only another name for it. Mr. Carri 172 wun imagined that he was caning bad words out of the lad, when he was in reality caning bad thoughts into him. We do not say that he should not have caned himâ\\x80\\x94it was bitterly cold weather, and even a school 172 master must needs warm himself when the opportunity offersâ\\x80\\x94but that he should have done something else as well. The matter being unexplained, Dick Arbour became a bad boy in the eyes of the master, while his resentful conduct against the Titan Dempsey earned him a reputation, scarce less unenviable, for â\\x80\\x9cbump 172 tiousness â\\x80\\x9d among the boys. His impatience of a tyranny under which they had all of them suffered, more or less, without complaint, was naturally distasteful; villageTIIE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 37 Hampdens are rarely popular; and to be so, it is above all things necessary that they shall be success 172 ful and uncaned. Matters being in this unfavourable position, a match at snow-balling between one-half of the school against the other half, with Dempsey commanding the opposite faction, was the very thing for Dick to enter into with ardour. For us, who are getting on in years, and who wear spectacles, there is, however, scarcely a more repulsive amusement : next to being inadvertently launched upon a slide on the foot-pavement, and beholding, as our legs are leaving us in different direc 172 tions, a crowd of miscreants bearing down upon us with a hideous velocity, there is nothing more objectionable than to find ourselves in a snow-ball scrimmage. The extreme hardness of the missiles themselves is one con 172 sideration; but that is trifling (in the eyes of a philoso 172 pher), compared to the exhibition of vindictive passion which accompanies their flight : the visage of each com 172 batant betrays a wish that he were casting Greek fire or Armstrong shells instead of snow, and seems to grudge every moment that is spent in the manufacture of his diabolical weapon. We have seen one of such savages so maddened by the artificial avalanche, as to rush upon a small boy who had had nothing whatever to do with it, and rub a handful of snow into the back of his neck with an energy which, if it had been frost-bitten, would have been benevolence itself. Not a few dogS\\'â\\x80\\x94whose characteristic, as the poet tells us, is delight in strifeâ\\x80\\x94 are similarly stirred to the depths of their brutal nature38 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, by snow, and will roll and growl in it, with evident regret that the formation of their fore-paws forbids their using it as an engine of destruction. It is probable, if certain theories be true, that these animals may have once been school-boys, who have perished in their early youth in a snow-scrimmage. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99ve been and broken my nose,â\\x80\\x9d cried Johnnie Arbour on a sudden, exhibiting that feature to his brother in a flattened condition, and with a perceptible dint where the snow-shell had exploded and burst in all directions over his face, like the radiations of a broken window: â\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99ve broken my nose, Dick, and I am sure theyâ\\x80\\x99re putting stones in their snow-balls.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe devil they are !â\\x80\\x9d cried Dick, whose caning had not cured him of strong languageâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthen two can play at that game, Johnnie; so here goes.â\\x80\\x9d The brothers threw together. A great cry immediately arose from the opposite ranks. A scanty mizzle succeeded to the storm of snow 172 balls, and then altogether ceased. General William Dempsey had fallen backwards, as falls on Mount Avernus the thunder-smitten oak, and a crowd gathered around him, exclaiming: â\\x80\\x9cDempseyâ\\x80\\x99s eyeâ\\x80\\x99s out!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Dempseyâ\\x80\\x99s blinded with a stone ! â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Dempseyâ\\x80\\x99s dead ! Johnnie Arbour turned as white as his sliirt-collar â\\x80\\x94and indeed w hiter, for the occurrence happened upon a Saturdayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c I threw no stone, Dick,â\\x80\\x9d said he. Dick lost his colour too, as he replied : â\\x80\\x9c Iâ\\x80\\x99m very sorry, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure, but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t aim at him in particular.â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 39 â\\x80\\x9cWho put a stone into his snow-ball?â\\x80\\x9d cried the captain of Eichardâ\\x80\\x99s side. â\\x80\\x9c I did,â\\x80\\x9d responded the lad sturdily ; â\\x80\\x9c the fellows upon Dempseyâ\\x80\\x99s side began it though.â\\x80\\x9d An indignant hiss broke forth from those about the injured youth, and especially from such as had been guilty of the practice complained of. The rest were naturally angry that poor Dempsey should have been even alluded to by young Bumptious, at such a time. He had been often heard to vow that he would be even with Dempsey, and he had now, it was evident, taken advantage of a public scrimmage to avenge a private wrong. Even those of his own side who were yet about him, fell away from him ; and presently, Brother Johnnie, after a few moments of vacillation, hung his head down, and slinked away, leaving poor Dick stand 172 ing alone. There was much hardship, and wrong, and sorrow lying between Bichard Arbour and that rest which at last befalleth the most weary of us ; but perhaps he was not doomed to experience a moment so intensely wretched as that present one, when friend and brother had for 172 saken him, and he stood alone in the playground of Messrs. Dot and Carriwunâ\\x80\\x94the Black Sheep of that youthful fold.40 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, CHAPTER THE FIFTH. A COOL RECEPTION. It had long been customary with Mr. Ingram Arbour, since his brotherâ\\x80\\x99s death, to leave Golden Square upon Friday afternoons for the cottage by the river, where he would remain till Monday morning, when the earliest train from the neighbouring town would convey him back refreshed to the haunts of commerce. On these occasions, his nephew, Adolphus, would accompany him, except when business of any pressing nature detained him in the city ; and upon the Saturday evening we have in our mind, these two gentlemen were sitting in the widowâ\\x80\\x99s drawing-room with the rest of the family circle, exclusive of Johnnie and Dick, who were at school. Thirteen years or so had passed over them since we first made their acquaintance, bringing change to each, although in different measure. The lines upon the merchantâ\\x80\\x99s brow were now as numerous again, as though they were ruled for double entry, and although his eyes lacked nothing yet of their stern determination, the â\\x80\\x9c hateful crow â\\x80\\x9d had set its footmarks round them. Mrs. Benjamin Arbour had suffered a severer changeTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 41 than he. Time, which had spared to mark her still smooth brow, had frosted her brown hair, and driven the lifeblood from her cheeks, and weighed her eyelids down ; they seemed to droop as those of some traveller in the snow, to whom Death whispers, mocking the sweet tones of Sleep. Her gentle voice was weary ; her smiles were rare and faint, and died away as swift as dip of oar from face of river. Except for the girl beside her, almost a woman nowâ\\x80\\x94golden-haired, angel-featured Maggieâ\\x80\\x94standing beside her motherâ\\x80\\x99s chair, and as though that was not near enough, nor gave sufficient assurance of her protecting love, with one arm round her neck, and one lily hand clasped in hers so tenderly â\\x80\\x94except for her little Maggie, the mother must have died. â\\x80\\x9cMy sister-in-law,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Ingram Arbour would sometimes remark to common friends, â\\x80\\x9c is just like one of those creepers which require a stick to hold on to life by, and canâ\\x80\\x99t stand up of themselves.â\\x80\\x9d To which Mrs. Arbour might have retortedâ\\x80\\x94if the poor lady had had such a thing as a retort left in her by this time, which was not the caseâ\\x80\\x94that her brother-in-law was one of those peculiar sticks which no creeper can ever be trained to cling to, although some few may submit to be bound to them by the bass of self-interest. Adolphus, too, whose mouth had increased with his years till it almost sought for refuge in the\\'sandy tracts of his whiskers, entertained but a poor opinion of his mother, and was continually wondering to himself from whom his own exceeding sagacity could have been inherited ; while Maria, who had taken the whole c 242 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, household management out of the widowâ\\x80\\x99s hands, was for ever contrasting the improved state of domestic affairs with that of the old rÃ©gime under her predecessor. The relationship of that person to herself could have been scarcely unknown to her, but so completely were her private feelings under control, and so paramount was her sense of truth and duty, that, hearing her in 172 veigh against the extravagance, weakness, and even the irrÃ©ligion of a certain late head of a family, you would never have guessed that she was speaking all the time of her own mother. She it was to whom the discovery was due that the maids were sluggards in winter, and who caused her bedroom fire to he lit by half-past six A. M., in order that one of them, at least, should not lie too long. Yellow-skinned Maria was of a snaky tem 172 perament, and wanted a good deal of warming, but she was likely to be cold enoughâ\\x80\\x94as Dr. Babbicombe once observed of her, with no less force than freedomâ\\x80\\x94if her caloric depended upon her being taken to anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s bosom. Indeed, how Adolphus and she ever managed to keep up an alliance, as they did (offensive in every sense), is a great mystery, since there was scarce half a trowelful of social cement of any sort between them. He certainly did not sympathise with her doubling the customary length of the evening devotions, which, in the exercise of her domestic supremacy, she had seen it right to do. That young man always knelt down with his face well over the newspaper, while his sister, the priestess, delivered her denunciations as if she enjoyed them, and even rasped out the benedictions themselvesTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 43 as though they were steel-filings. Uncle Ingramâ\\x80\\x99s devotional attitude was the leaning back on his arm 172 chair as far as he could go, with his hands clasped upon his lap, and his legs crossed one over the other ; while, doubtless to conceal the force of his penitential emotions, his pocket-handkerchief was modestly cast over his head and face. Maggie and lier mother knelt together with their heads over one cushion ; and the two maids were stationed as far from the rest of the household as the limits of the little drawing-room would permit, between the windows, and in a thorough draught. Nevertheless, woe to Jane or Rachel if a cough from either of them should interrupt their spiritual pastoress ; while it w-ould have been positively â\\x80\\x9c as much as her place was worth,â\\x80\\x9d had either of them blown her nose. Imagine, therefore, the scene that ensued upon the evening of which we write, when, immediately after the commencement of prayers, the back-door bell was heard to tinkle with a sort of guilty indecision. Miss Maria read on as though there were nothing audible beyond the breathing of Uncle Ingram, which always began to be stertorous coincidently with the commencement of family devotions; but she had more than a suspicion that it was the bakerâ\\x80\\x99s young man coming surreptitiously after Jane, and she took one eye off the sacred page, and set it to watch the behaviour of that unfortunate domestic. Again the bell sounded through the houseâ\\x80\\x94 this time with a more decided intention of making itself heardâ\\x80\\x94and Jane turned round imploringly to entreat44 EICHAED aeboue; oe, permission to answer it, with a face like a tomato, from confusion; but upon meeting the sentinel eye with a decidedly forbidding expression in it, returned, more like a Jerusalem artichoke in hue, to her cane-bottomed chair. A third time the back-door bell sounded, and pulled upon this occasion by so impatient a hand, that you could hear the wire rattle, and the bell-metal beat against the skirting-board. â\\x80\\x9cWhy the devil donâ\\x80\\x99t somebody answer that hell?â\\x80\\x9d broke forth Uncle Ingram, awakened by the tumult, and not being able to call to mind, upon the instant, the nature of the occupation in which he was supposed to have been engaged. Jane rushed out of the room at a permissive signal from Miss Maria, while the rest of the household awaited, in positions half expectant, half devout, whatever catastrophe chanced to he impending. They heard the lock turned, and the chain unfastened, and a â\\x80\\x9cLorâ\\x80\\x99 bless me!â\\x80\\x9d from the absent cook; then the door was banged to by another hand, a hasty step came along the passage, and there presented himselfâ\\x80\\x94Master Dick ! â\\x80\\x9c You young scoundrel,â\\x80\\x9d roared Uncle Ingram, â\\x80\\x9c w T hat do you mean by breaking in here like a burglar at such a time as this ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c He has run away from school,â\\x80\\x9d suggested Mr. Adolphus Arbour, maliciously. â\\x80\\x9c We are at prayers, sir,â\\x80\\x9d emphasised Miss Maria, looking like Torquemada in petticoats. â\\x80\\x9c What is the matter, love ?â\\x80\\x9d cried Maggie tenderly, running up to the haggard-looking lad.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 45 â\\x80\\x9cI am expelled, dear mother,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed he, in a miserable voice. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve cut Bill Dempseyâ\\x80\\x99s eye out with a snow-ball, though Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure I didâ\\x80\\x99nt mean it. They expelled me, and so I thought Iâ\\x80\\x99d come away at once.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou young ruffian!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Uncle Ingram. â\\x80\\x9c lieâ\\x80\\x99ll come to be hung !â\\x80\\x9d observed Adolphus reflec 172 tively. â\\x80\\x9cAnd then the devil will get him,â\\x80\\x9d added Maria, with the air of one who foresees the future without dis 172 satisfaction. â\\x80\\x9c Mother, wonâ\\x80\\x99t you speak to me ?â\\x80\\x9d asked the wretched boy. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t care for what these say; but do, pray, speak to me.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cY r ou donâ\\x80\\x99t care for your eldest brother, then?â\\x80\\x9d de 172 manded Maria, severely. â\\x80\\x9c No ; nor for you either,â\\x80\\x9d responded Dick, bestowing one fiery glance upon his interlocutor, and then fixing as before, his appealing eyes upon his mother only. â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t care for your Uncle Ingram, then?â\\x80\\x9d re 172 marked the crafty Adolphus. â\\x80\\x9c Come to mamma,â\\x80\\x9d interposed Maggie, judiciously ; â\\x80\\x9c I am sure she will never condemn you without a hearing.â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Arbour was sitting in her chair with her hands before her weeping eyes, and was glad enough to bury her face in the boyâ\\x80\\x99s curls as he knelt down before her. â\\x80\\x9cHush, Dicky, dear, donâ\\x80\\x99t sob, donâ\\x80\\x99t sob,â\\x80\\x9d she whis 172 pered; â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t believe you are so bad as they make out.â\\x80\\x9d46 RICHARD arbour; or, â\\x80\\x9cI did not mean to cut Bill Dempsey*, eye out,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Dick, hysterically ; â\\x80\\x9c but they all believe I did.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t signify what you meant, you little black 172 guard, if you did it,â\\x80\\x9d observed Uncle Ingram, taking his usual practical view of things. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s my belief your mother will be your ruin. Letitia, what does the Bible recommend us to do with boys like these?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Whip â\\x80\\x99em,â\\x80\\x9d observed Maria, with conciseness, and in order that the advice might not be lost in Eastern meta 172 phor. â\\x80\\x9c I have been whipped,â\\x80\\x9d cried the lad, lifting up his head. â\\x80\\x9c Mr. Carriwun beat me till his cane frayed out at the edges.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Not enough, sir,â\\x80\\x9d returned the implacable Maria, â\\x80\\x9c If I were your mother â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes, but you ainâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the victim sharply ; â\\x80\\x9c youâ\\x80\\x99re nobodyâ\\x80\\x99s mother, miss, and Doctor Babbicombe says that youâ\\x80\\x99re never likely to be anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s either. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you go bullying me, now, or Iâ\\x80\\x99ll begin saying things, mind you.â\\x80\\x9d The ladâ\\x80\\x99s whole body trembled with passion in every fibre ; his eyes darted fire as he spoke, and there seemed to be every probability of his â\\x80\\x9c saying things,â\\x80\\x9d and of a very disagreeable character too ; when, at a sign from Uncle Ingram, Adolphus picked Dick up, and tearing him with not a little violence out of his motherâ\\x80\\x99s arms, carried him out of the room. Then there was a total silence, presently broken by â\\x80\\x9cthudsâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94blows struck with a stick against an unre-THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 47 verberating bodyâ\\x80\\x94from a neighbouring apartment, but not one cry. â\\x80\\x9c I cause it to be done for his own good, Letitia, and for your good,â\\x80\\x9d observed Uncle Ingram, in explanation, and with composure, but keeping his eyes averted from the object of his benevolence nevertheless. â\\x80\\x9c Mamma has fainted !â\\x80\\x9d cried Maggie with a piercing shriek. â\\x80\\x9cTell Adolphus to stopâ\\x80\\x94somebody. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll kill her amongst you, at last, I do believe.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cGood Heavens!â\\x80\\x9d cried Uncle Ingram, frightened out of his wits by an occurrence so entirely out of his own experience, â\\x80\\x9cwhy doesnâ\\x80\\x99t the fool stop? Eun, Maria.â\\x80\\x9d Maria did not stir; but Eachel ran into the dining 172 room straightway, and almost upset Mr. Adolphus, who was coming out with a face whiter than usual. â\\x80\\x9c I want a poultice,â\\x80\\x9d observed he to the astonished domestic ; and indeed he did, for Master Dickâ\\x80\\x94whose hands he had taken the precaution of securingâ\\x80\\x94had made his teeth meet in the fleshy part of his correctorâ\\x80\\x99s thumb.48 KICHAKD ABSQUE; OE, CHAPTEE THE SIXTH. FALSELY ACCUSED. The next day being Sunday, was passed, by Mariaâ\\x80\\x99s directions, in total silence as regarded tbe events of the preceding evening. It was to be â\\x80\\x9ca day of rest for allâ\\x80\\x9d observed that young lady with an air of charity ; and it was occupied by herself and faction in contriving severities applicable to Master Eichardâ\\x80\\x99s case upon the morrow. To Dick it was rather a day of suspense than rest, which are not identical things by any means ; and to his mother, it was twenty-four long hours of agony. This lady had obtained Uncle Ingramâ\\x80\\x99s protection for her offspring at a considerable sacrifice. She had never had much of that female peculiarity popularly, or unpopu- larly, known as â\\x80\\x9c a will of her own,â\\x80\\x9d for the deceased Benjamin had given way to all her gentle wishes in small concerns, while in important matters the two always lovingly agreed ; and now, finding herself crossed and denied upon all occasions under the new dynasty, she had for many years ceased to express her feelings in public, and only now and then lightened her breaking heart to Maggie, who slept in the same chamber. SheTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 49 had taken Richardâ\\x80\\x99s hand in hers under her shawl at church that day, feeling safe from reproof within that sacred building, and mother and child had thus inter 172 changed all sorts of affectionate thoughts together, merely by the pressure of their fingers. Maria had regarded them with lofty scorn, and on one occasion even contemplated the rapping of Dickâ\\x80\\x99s disengaged hand, which lacked a prayer-book, but she thought it upon the whole more prudent to resist that temptation ; so she contented herself with pitching her hymns at him (not of course her hymn-booh), and of repeating with peculiar stress such parts of the service as might be strained to apply to an unregenerate youth of his description. Adolphus secretly trod upon his toes during the anthem, and upon his resenting that personal indignity without the like precaution, gave an appealing look to Uncle Ingram, who instantly made a note of the offence in the memorandum tablets which he always carried about with him, and used without the slightest reference to time or place. â\\x80\\x9c Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid, Maggie,â\\x80\\x9d whispered the widow, sobbing, when she and her younger daughter had retired to their chamber on Sunday nightâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c I am afraid that they will send our poor dear Richard to sea.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Surely not, dear mother,â\\x80\\x9d answered Maggie quickly ; â\\x80\\x9c he is hut a child, you know ; and besides, they will not dare to do it unless you give consent.â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Benjamin Arbour sighed ; if she had not had a little speck of pride still left within her, she would pro-50 RICHARD ARBOTJR ; OR, bably have spoken ; but Maggie understood her all the same. â\\x80\\x9c Why, what has our Dick done, mother, beyond his being a little mischievous and unruly? He does not treat Maria and Adolphus respectfully, it is true, but they on their parts are very far from kind to him. This snow 172 ball business is a very sad one, of course, but it is not clear that he is to blame, or evexr certain that he did the mischief.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Bless you, my dear Maggie,â\\x80\\x9d returned her mother, â\\x80\\x9c for saying what all clay long my heart has yearned to say, and dared not ; but you see, my child, your Uncle Ingram is so hard and stern, and your brother and sisterâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Hay, mamma,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the young girl gently ; â\\x80\\x9c you surely know far better than they what is good for Pilchard ; and as for Uncle Ingram, he means us all well enough, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure. If you will let me speak to himâ\\x80\\x94in your name, as it were, for, in your present state of health, such an excitement would beâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ho, Maggie, no,â\\x80\\x9d cried the poor lady, â\\x80\\x9c I must shrink from nothing for Dickâ\\x80\\x99s sake, and for the sake of him who left him in my charge. Uncle Ingram may take all away except my boy, but he must leave me him â\\x80\\x94he must leave me Kichard. 0 child, you know not how his baby-face once comforted me, when Death was in tins room, and misery everywhere. He shall never, never, never go to sea.â\\x80\\x9d We are aware that an apology is due, on the part of this poor lady, for the display of such an unreasonableTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 51 abhorrence of the maritime profession. It is probable that her thoughts were not directed towards Her Majestyâ\\x80\\x99s navy, or even to those celebrated Al vessels in the pro 172 prietorship of Messrs. Green and others ; she merely looked upon the sea as a huge separator between herself and him committed to it, and her view was, so far, a correct one. â\\x80\\x9c Mother, mother dearest,â\\x80\\x9d replied Maggie, â\\x80\\x9c if you will allow me to go down alone to-morrow morning, I promise you that what you fear shall not take place ; and if there is any chance of its taking place, that you shall be sent for. Will you not trust me, mother ? Promise me that you will not rise to-morrow, or, at least, not come down stairs.â\\x80\\x9d Good Maggie, cunning Maggie, serpent and dove in one, that was well said. Mrs. Arbour wisely assented to be more unwell than usual upon the morrow. When tyrants rule, there is no resource for us but dissimu 172 lation. Accordingly, upon the next morning, the arm-chair â\\x80\\x94symbol of empty stateâ\\x80\\x94that stood beside the tea- maker, was vacant, and the company was quietly informed by Maggie that mamma was not coming down. The whole armoury of offensive weapons, therefore, which had been stacked in more than one bosom, in readiness for the expected discussion, became at once next to valuelessâ\\x80\\x94old stores to be parted with at enormous sacrifice, even if they found any market at all. Yellow Maria slipped from the apartment, and came back purple.52 KICHARD arbour; or, â\\x80\\x9c What is the meaning of this, Margaret ? I canâ\\x80\\x99t get into mammaâ\\x80\\x99s room.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo, dear,â\\x80\\x9d replied that young lady with great sweetness, â\\x80\\x9c she is not well this morning, and must not he disturbed. I locked her door myself, and have got the key. Dr. Bahbicombe says it is not good for her to he made to faint.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c 1 donâ\\x80\\x99t understand your language, Margaret,â\\x80\\x9d quoth Maria with asperity. â\\x80\\x9c Who makes her faint, I should like to know ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAdolphus did it on Saturday,â\\x80\\x9d returned Maggie, with the quiet air of a narrator of facts ; â\\x80\\x9c hut nobody will do it to-day, at all events.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cLook where he bit my thumb!â\\x80\\x9d observed Adolphus, apologetically, and exhibiting the injured digit. â\\x80\\x9cYou had better keep it covered up,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Maggie, drily ; â\\x80\\x9c the air will only make it worse ; and besides, it isnâ\\x80\\x99t pretty to look at.â\\x80\\x9d This young lady was a lamb in all matters that concerned herself, but now that she had mother and brother to defend, she was a lioness with cubs. Adolphus and Maria quailed before her, and the more so because they knew that Uncle Ingram loved her. Under her protecting wing, Master Dick dipped largely into the muffin dÃ©pÃ´t intended for his seniors. Mr. Ingram Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s countenance exhibited an indecision not be 172 coming to it. â\\x80\\x9c I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand this, Margaret,â\\x80\\x9d quoth he at last ; â\\x80\\x9c to hear you talk, one w T ould imagine that this boy had deserved no punishment at all. He has actually cut another boyâ\\x80\\x99s eye outâ\\x80\\x94a most respectable lad.â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 53 â\\x80\\x9c Son of the banker,â\\x80\\x9d interpolated Adolphus, in a tone adapted to the description of a sacrilege. â\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean to do it,â\\x80\\x9d retorted Dick with indig 172 nation, and his mouth indecorously full. â\\x80\\x9c Hold your tongue, sir,â\\x80\\x9d observed Miss Maria solemnly. â\\x80\\x9c I shanâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d responded Dick with improved distinct 172 ness. â\\x80\\x9cSilence, Dick; please to be quiet,â\\x80\\x9d said Maggie. And Dick became as mute as a fish. â\\x80\\x9c It may have been quite an accident, uncle, as he asserts,â\\x80\\x9d continued the peace-maker; â\\x80\\x9cnor is it even fully proved that he did it at all.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c All the hoys say he had a grudge against Dempsey, and threw at him on purpose,â\\x80\\x9d observed Adolphus. â\\x80\\x9c It is not unusual for some persons to believe the worst of their fellow-creatures.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c But Johnnie says so himself, and heâ\\x80\\x99s his brother,â\\x80\\x9d retorted Adolphus. â\\x80\\x9c His brother !â\\x80\\x9d repeated Maggie scornfully, without further rejoinder ; but a less sagacious man than Uncle Ingram could have read in her flashing eyes the rest of her reply. â\\x80\\x9c Yes,â\\x80\\x9d answered he, â\\x80\\x9c there is certainly a had feeling, Adolphus, between you and Bichard. There is some 172 thing in what Margaret says, after all. I do not think I should be quite justified in sending himâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94-â\\x80\\x94 Maria held her finger up forbiddingly; it was for a single instant only, but Maggie caught its reflection in the mirror opposite, and turned upon her instantly, as54 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, the faithful sheep-dog on the wolf. â\\x80\\x9c No, Maria, he is not to be sent to sea. His mother told me to say that much. Not to sea.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c She must have been listening,â\\x80\\x9d said Maria to her 172 self, â\\x80\\x9c when I and Uncle Ingram talked it over in the dining-room last night. How careless it was of me not to have thought of looking into the china-closet first, as I generally do !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I have made up my mind to give him another chance,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Ingram Arbour ; â\\x80\\x9c although I much doubt whether he deserves it. I shall put him at once into my own office, in some capacity where he will be pretty sharply looked after. You know your arithmetic pretty well, I suppose, Mister?â\\x80\\x9d The thought of Practice flitted momentarily over poor Dickâ\\x80\\x99s mind, casting a bat-like shadow ; but he answered, â\\x80\\x9c Yes, uncle,â\\x80\\x9d with tolerable cheerfulness. â\\x80\\x9c Then thatâ\\x80\\x99s arranged,â\\x80\\x9d quoth his new proprietor decisively; â\\x80\\x9cand you will pack up at once, and accom 172 pany your brother and me by the mid-day train to town.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNot to-day, uncle,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick with firmness, although he looked terribly frightened. â\\x80\\x9c I will go to 172 morrow, but not to-day.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x94willâ\\x80\\x94notâ\\x80\\x94go!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the merchant with awful distinctness and solemnity. â\\x80\\x9cDid I under 172 stand you to say, sir, that youâ\\x80\\x94willâ\\x80\\x94notâ\\x80\\x94go ?â\\x80\\x9d This recalcitrancy, so far exceeding the hopeful ex 172 pectations of his eldest brother and sister, struck those worthies dumb ; even Maggie could but whisper,THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 55 â\\x80\\x9c Richard, Richard, you will ruin yourself, in spite of all that can be done for you !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I must see William Dempsey before I go,â\\x80\\x9d explained the lad, hanging down his head, and blushing. â\\x80\\x9cLittle hypocrite !â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated Maria. â\\x80\\x9c Itâ\\x80\\x99s my belief, he wants to put his other eye out,â\\x80\\x9d observed Adolphus. â\\x80\\x9cMay I go, please, uncle?â\\x80\\x9d reiterated the boy appealingly, and without taking any notice of these aspersions. â\\x80\\x9c Please to let him go,â\\x80\\x9d pleaded Maggie, taking the merchantâ\\x80\\x99s not unwilling hand in hers. â\\x80\\x9cI must be at my office this afternoon,â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated that gentleman with decision. â\\x80\\x9cHe shall go by himself, to-morrow, by the very first train,â\\x80\\x9d urged Margaret. â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t trust him,â\\x80\\x9d thundered Uncle Ingram; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s the mail-train, and he will rob the post-bags. At all events, he would not come to work, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Adolphus can stay behind, and go with him, uncle.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cVery well, then, so let it be. But mind, young sir, you do not get another holiday for six months to come.â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Arbour was glad enough that matters had turned out no worse for Master Richard, but yet could hardly spare him out of her sight even to pay this praise 172 worthy visit to his injured school-fellow. He found Mr. WiRiam Dempsey at his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house, and in a darkened chamber, in a frame of mind very different from that for which he had been hitherto distinguished. The lad had56 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, come prepared for reproach and upbraiding, not for the quiet hush of a sick-room, and the forgiveness of one who felt himself stricken for his evil deserts. A terrible misfortune was overhanging and likely to fall upon the poor young man; the sight of his other eye was threatened, nor did the doctors give much hope that total blindness could he averted. Kichard received this news with a hurst of tears. â\\x80\\x9c I shall never bully anybody any more,â\\x80\\x9d said Dempsey, smiling faintly, and feeling about for his enemyâ\\x80\\x99s hand. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t take it, Dempsey,â\\x80\\x9d cried the other in an agony ; â\\x80\\x9c I wish from my heart that it had been cut off long ago ! But you donâ\\x80\\x99t, you canâ\\x80\\x99t believe I did it on purpose. Pray, pray say that.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou never meant to do me any such harm as this,â\\x80\\x9d answered the poor fellow ; â\\x80\\x9c of that I am quite certain, Dick.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c No, nor any harm, upon my soul. I did not throw at you, Dempsey. I told my mother so at church, yesterday, and I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell her a lie there, I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t, indeed. I put the stone in because your side were doing it.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a stone,â\\x80\\x9d replied the sufferer peevishly; â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9calthough it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter now what it was. All the school knows it was a piece of bottle-glass ; the snow 172 ball in which it was, was picked up close beside me with my blood upon it.

You should always speak to a fellow that canâ\\x80\\x99t see.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c0 Dempsey, Dempsey,â\\x80\\x9d cried the hoy, in a voice so altered, that the other called from the bed to know whether it was he indeed ; â\\x80\\x9c listen to me just one moment ; I have something to say to you, Dempsey, worse than all that has happened yet ! Promise me that you will never tell, for it can do nobody good now, but only harm ; and yet I must set myself right with you and Maggie.â\\x80\\x9d He came close beside the pillow, and whispered : â\\x80\\x9c It was not me at all, Willy. I threw a stone, I know ; but Johnnieâ\\x80\\x94my brother, you know, my own brotherâ\\x80\\x94he threw the broken glass : I saw him making up the snow-hall with that inside !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c The sneaking villain !â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated the sick lad angrily. â\\x80\\x9c Hush, hush, Willy ; say nothing about it ; hut only now you know it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t me. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t help telling you that, you looked so ill and changed.â\\x80\\x9d Dick stood upon tiptoe tenderly, and kissed the poor ladâ\\x80\\x99s forehead above the bandage that was round his eyes. â\\x80\\x9c I am going away to London, and shall not he able to come and see you again for months.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cJohnnie has never been to ask after me, Dick,â\\x80\\x9d groaned the other bitterly ; â\\x80\\x9c all the school have been except thatâ\\x80\\x9d58 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, â\\x80\\x9cHush!â\\x80\\x9d cried Eichard; â\\x80\\x9chere is Dr. Babbicombe ; hush, for Heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake !â\\x80\\x9d The doctor looked at his quondam favourite with a veiy severe face : â\\x80\\x9c I am glad to see you here, Eichard ; although it is the least that you can do after what has happenedâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t say that, doctor,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the patient, with a touch of his old arbitrary manner ; â\\x80\\x9c I wonâ\\x80\\x99t have Dick abused. God bless you, Dick, and forgive me all Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done to you.â\\x80\\x9d Eichard Arbour ran home through the snow with very different feelings from those with which he had arrived some fifteen minutes before. â\\x80\\x9c I used to think Dempsey was all bad, poor fellow,â\\x80\\x9d thought he ; â\\x80\\x9c and though our Eachel always said that Johnnie was all for himself, and a regular Number Wunner, I never dreamed of his being such aâ\\x80\\x9d and Dick shook his curly head again and again, for want of a term of sufficient reprobation.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 59 CHAPTER THE SEVENTH. DAEKENDIM STREET. Early next morning, Richard Arbour had taken leave of his dear mother and of Sister Maggieâ\\x80\\x94to whom alone he confided the ,secret of his innocence in the snow-ball matterâ\\x80\\x94and was upon his road with his big brother to the railway station, to which the cart containing his small supply of luggage had already been despatched. He looked back more than once, upon his way, on the little home wherein he had passed his happy child-life, with regretful eyes, and the blind of that chamber- window over the dining-room was always held aside by an unseen hand, and two unseen faces were, he well knew, being pressed there against the frosty pane. He would be a good boy, and obey his uncle, for their sake, thought he ; and waved his cap as he entered the clump of trees that shut the cottage finally from view. â\\x80\\x9c Now, then, what are you stopping for ?â\\x80\\x9d growled Adolphus. â\\x80\\x9c None of your cunning tricks with me, my man ; you may keep them for the women-folks, I do assure you. You donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to mind about such a chap as you. Besides, I aint going to part with60 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, yon just yet, my young shaver, so my feelings are not so overcome. You â\\x80\\x9911 be in my department in the office, mind you, and youâ\\x80\\x99d better be precious careful what youâ\\x80\\x99re about. Come sir, youâ\\x80\\x99ve got â\\x80\\x9c Bunawayâ\\x80\\x9d written on your face, I see, so weâ\\x80\\x99ll just walk hand in hand, if you please.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Adolphus Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s views upon what fraternal behaviour should be, were, as we have seen, somewhat peculiar, and his idea of what walking hand in hand implies, was not less original. It consisted in clutching hold of the cuff of Dickâ\\x80\\x99s greatcoat, and dragging him thereby along with him, as a folio-policeman drags a duodecimo-pickpocket. In another moment, the great 172 coat was trailing in the snow, and its proprietor, having withdrawn from it as in a pantomime trickâ\\x80\\x94having sloughed it as a serpent in a hurry might slough his skin â\\x80\\x94was already some twenty yards on his road home again. Equipped only in the short school-boy jacket, so excel 172 lently adapted for pedestrian exercise, as the boy was, Adolphus coidd never have caught him, and he knew it. â\\x80\\x9c Hi !â\\x80\\x9d roared he, â\\x80\\x9c you stop ! Do you hear me, you young scoundrel? You stop !â\\x80\\x9d Dick did hear him, and stopped accordingly, upon a heap of flints, intended for the repairing of the road ; from which having selected those best adapted for his purpose, he commenced a Parthian war, now retreating from, now advancing upon, the enemy, and now, Deu 172 calion-like, casting the stones behind him, at a venture, as he flew. Adolphus, in deadly fear of these missilesâ\\x80\\x94 the fate of Mr. William Dempsey occurring to him withTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 61 peculiar force under the circumstancesâ\\x80\\x94was constrained to hold the greatcoat shield-like before his face, which of course prevented him from making anything save a blind charge upon his assailant, and compelled him to remain, upon the whole, in a condition of inglorious inaction. â\\x80\\x9cI will not take hold of you any more, Dick,â\\x80\\x9d parleyed the besieged party from behind his curtain or rampart. â\\x80\\x9c I know that ; thank you for nothing,â\\x80\\x9d returned the enemy, dexterously smiting the kneecap of the foe with a flint. â\\x80\\x9c I wonâ\\x80\\x99t hurt you, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t bully you, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be good to you,â\\x80\\x9d roared the limping Adolphus. â\\x80\\x9c I must throw these three more stones,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick, â\\x80\\x9c and then weâ\\x80\\x99ll have pax.â\\x80\\x9d Those stones, accordingly, this master of the situation discharged, and one of them with effect ; and then the two forces concluded an armistice, and reached the rail 172 way station only just in time. Adolphus took advantage of the hurry to furnish Dick with a half-price ticket instead of a whole one, pocketing the surplus fare with which his uncle had intrusted him, and laying the burden of the imposture upon Richard himself, who was more than thirteen years of age, and looked fifteen. The latter never dreamed but that this was done by his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s orders, and received the reproofs and expostu 172 lations of the ticket-viewers all the way to London with a magnanimity which is only born of a sense of duty. His thoughts were mainly fixed upon that metropolis, so wondrous and vaguely promising to the soul of youth,62 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, from the days of another Dickâ\\x80\\x94who was the scapegrace of his family alsoâ\\x80\\x94even until now, and on the new manner of life upon which he was about to enter. His ideas of the mercantile professionâ\\x80\\x94despite his residence at Messrs. Dot and Carriwunâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94were principally derived from the information afforded by the Arabian Nightsâ\\x80\\x99 Entertainments, which led him to believe that sales were effected by means of purses of gold coin, and that the chief article of commerce consisted of precious stonesâ\\x80\\x94 some of which perhaps, being rubbed smartly, might produce attendant genii. He made a pretty good guess, however, in concluding that his future Old Man of the Sea would be no other than the individual now opposite to him, over whose countenance, whenever he had occasion to rub his kneecapâ\\x80\\x94which was rather fre 172 quentlyâ\\x80\\x94there passed a decidedly malevolent expression. As to Uncle Ingram, there had certainly been nothing about him, identical with those splendid personages who were wont to purchase a thousand bales of silk at Balsora, or to furnish Haroun A1 Easchid with those young ladies of surpassing beauty, so full of reminiscences of the king their father, and their august mode of life at home. But then Dick felt that Uncle Ingram in the country might be a very different man from Uncle Ingram among his waresâ\\x80\\x94for business matters were never referred to at the cottage, except in such tones as befitted their sacred and mysterious characterâ\\x80\\x94and he did not altogether despair of finding that relative sitting cross-legged under a dome of great magnificence, and selling diamonds in sacks by dry measure.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. Go As a matter of fact, however, Mr. Ingram Arbour was a china and earthenware dealer, and sold dinner- services, jugs, basins, and so on, by the ton, in Dark- endim Street, City. He was a sort of commercial Pandaras, a go-between â\\x80\\x99twixt the manufacturers and retail dealers ; and, if he had not been a Londoner, would perhaps have been called a Manchester warehouse 172 man. The Darkendim Street establishment, although of vast extent, was very ill lighted, and had rather the air of being underground than otherwise. The two brothers went direct to this emporium, and threaded their way among mighty crates, with musty hay peering through their ribs as if from a manger, to the sanctum of Mr. Ingram Arbour, which was like one of those boxes, and not much larger, in which private watchmen keep guard at night over banks and other buildings, wherein it is essential to persuade the public that there is money lodged. Uncle Ingram held out a finger to his little nephew, by way of welcome to commercial life ; and Dick, having taken hold of it respectfully, bent it slightlyâ\\x80\\x94for he found it impossible to shake it â\\x80\\x94and returned it to its proprietor. â\\x80\\x9c You had better take him to Mr. Mickleham, Adol 172 phus, for the present, and he will set him to work at once. And mind youâ\\x80\\x99re a good boy, sir, from hence 172 forthâ\\x80\\x94dâ\\x80\\x99ye hear ?â\\x80\\x94and whatever you do, donâ\\x80\\x99t throw my china about into peopleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes.â\\x80\\x9d With which not very encouraging remark, Uncle Ingram turned to the newspaper that was lying above Ids ledger, as it sometimes does, I have observed, withG4 EICHAKD AEBOUK ; OK, even the best of business men, and Dick and his conduc 172 tor, like Dante and his guide in another place, resumed their way through the gloom. This time, however, they ascended a flight of stairs, and returned across another floor to a room which overlooked the narrow street. A benevolent-looking old gentleman, with gold spectacles and slightly bald, sat at a huge desk with an enormous book before him, lisping, with his mouth almost shut, not in numbers, but in figures, to himself. It struck Dick that he must have been always doing this, and wondered within himself whether it could have been this very individual who had invented â\\x80\\x9cPracticeâ\\x80\\x9d for the confusion of youth. So soon as he spoke, however, it was evident that he was far too good-natured a person to have done anything of the sort. â\\x80\\x9cGood day, Mr. Adolphus,â\\x80\\x9d cried he in a cheery voice ; â\\x80\\x9c and is this your brother Dick come to be lord mayor of London, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what beside ? Let us shake hands, my good young sir.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Mickleham descended cautiously from his perch, by help of a cross-bar let into the legs of his lofty stool for that very purpose, and gave Dick a hearty welcome. â\\x80\\x9c I think,â\\x80\\x9d continued lie, as the little fellow squeezed the friendly hand as tightly as he could, â\\x80\\x9c we shall get on very well together, we two.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf you do,â\\x80\\x9d observed Adolphus grimly, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ll be about the first that has done it with that young gentle 172 man.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Pooh, pooh, poohâ\\x80\\x94hush, hush !â\\x80\\x9d cried the old man ; â\\x80\\x9c I know nothing of all that, and I wonâ\\x80\\x99t hear anythingTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. about it. When such little lads as these get into trouble, there are always faults on both sides.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell, well,â\\x80\\x9d returned Adolphus, â\\x80\\x9ctime will shew ; only, if I am not very much out in my calculationsâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Thatâ\\x80\\x99s just what youâ\\x80\\x99re making me be,â\\x80\\x9d interposed the old gentleman. â\\x80\\x9c If the lad is to be nnder my care for awhile, I cannot be distracted by anything else, if you please. I shall have to begin again with Cock spur and Triangleâ\\x80\\x99s account, as it is.â\\x80\\x9d The heir-presumptive of the house walked off with a grating laugh, and left the old man and the boy together. Mr. Mickleham looked at Dick without speaking, until the echoes of the departing footsteps had died away ; then he drew him nearer to the light, and patted his curly locks approvingly. â\\x80\\x9cRichardâ\\x80\\x94your name is Richard, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it ?â\\x80\\x94Richard, my boy,â\\x80\\x9d said he in a tender tone, â\\x80\\x9cdo you understand book-keeping?â\\x80\\x9d Dick modestly replied that he was afraid he was not very good at it. â\\x80\\x9c Have you ever heard of Bottcher, Richardâ\\x80\\x94of the great Bottcher?â\\x80\\x9d Dick rather thought that he had heard the name (or something very like it) before. â\\x80\\x9cOf course you have,â\\x80\\x9d replied the old gentleman with enthusiasm ; â\\x80\\x9c who has not heard of the famous Bottcher ? Who does not feel regret that such a genius was not our own fellow-countryman ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAh, who indeed !â\\x80\\x9d murmured poor Dick, who felt that he was getting credit somehow for knowing some 172 thing or other of which he was profoundly ignorant. d 2GG RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, â\\x80\\x9c Here,â\\x80\\x9d continued the old man, delighted at finding a willing listener, if not a sympathiser with his parti 172 cular hobbyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c here is a piece of Meissen porcelain that has once been in the great BÃ´ttcherâ\\x80\\x99s own fingers. You .remember, doubtless, how the idea of making the white porcelain was suggested to him by the hair-powder which his valet put on his wig ; how precious became the earth from which it was made, and how it was forbidden to be exported, and was brought into the manufactory in sealed barrels by persons sworn to secrecy. The whole history of pottery can be read in those shelves yonder, Bichard.â\\x80\\x9d He pointed to innumer 172 able specimens of porcelain and earthenware arranged like pictures upon the wall, and carefully classified. â\\x80\\x9cThis is the pattern-room, and in these drawers are hundreds of specimens of the modern ware ; but those are the ancient gems, the priceless treasures.â\\x80\\x9d With as great a reverence as Ultramontanist ever paid to relic, he took down a misshapen and black brown something out of a sort of iron net on the extreme left of the line of shelves, and exclaimed with an air of triumph : â\\x80\\x9c Now what do you think of this, Richard ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Itâ\\x80\\x99s very ugly, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it, please, sir ?â\\x80\\x9d said Dick, deter- Â« mined to speak plainly this time, and not to be mis 172 understood again. â\\x80\\x9c Ugly ! â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Mickleham in a tone of the most undisguised horror. â\\x80\\x9c Why, I begin to think that what lias been said of you must be true. Ugly ! Why, you young reprobate, this was found in a tomb at Thebes, and must have been manufactured nearly fifteen hundredTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 67 years before the Christian era. It was made, perhaps, by the very father of the art. Ugly ! Why what on earth were those bright eyes given you for ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I beg your pardon, sir,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick with sincere contrition; â\\x80\\x9cI really am no judge at all. Iâ\\x80\\x99m only thirteen years old, although I look so tall. I daresay it is a very pretty jug indeed.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Jug ! â\\x80\\x9d echoed Mr. Mickleman with a shriek ; â\\x80\\x9c itâ\\x80\\x99s a bottle, sir ; a bottle of Chinese stoneware. Here is a sun-dried brick from Babylon, with a cuneiform inscrip 172 tion on it, telling us that it was made at the establish 172 ment of the Messrs. Cockspur and Triangle of that epoch. That straw and clay, sir, were put together three thousand years ago. Here, again, is a clay-book from the private library of Sennacherib, and contains the inventory of the furniture of his palace. Descending to modern times, here is a beautiful rustic figure from the hands of Bernard Palissy himself, he who, being unable to pay his assistant his wages, gave him the coat off his own back, and after sixteen years of poverty-stricken existence, triumphed. This rose-coloured SÃ¨vres Cupid was made for the famous Madame Dubarry, whose exquisite taste in porcelain must not, however, be permitted to blind us to the impro 172 priety of her behaviour ; she was as frail as her pink china. This splendid vase was one of a set purchased by Augustus III. at the price of a whole regiment of dragoons, and to my mind was worth a squadron ; while this tea-cup, made by Charles III. of Nor Goodness Heavens ! look, boy ! you have younger sight than I : can this, by any possibility, be a crack in the handle 168 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, Come here ; I would not venture to take it off its nail for half the treasures of Dresden.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Itâ\\x80\\x99s only a cobweb, sir,â\\x80\\x9d observed Dick, examining it ; â\\x80\\x9cjust let me blow it away.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Not for your life, boy, not for your life! â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mr. Mickleham in unaffected terror. â\\x80\\x9c Oh, the rashness aud foolhardiness of youth ! Just run your eye over this account for me, and tell me what you make it. What a turn you have given me, lad ; I shanâ\\x80\\x99t be fit for work for the next half hour. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s the bell going for the workmenâ\\x80\\x99s dinner, luckily, so I can conscientiously de 172 vote the interval to luncheon.â\\x80\\x9d The old gentleman opened a cupboard, and produced some sherry and biscuits. â\\x80\\x9cYou must be hungry, lad, after being in the country-air this morning. I remember it gave me a tre 172 mendous appetite the last time 1 was in itâ\\x80\\x94between thirteen and fourteen years ago.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDo you stop in this place all the year round, sir?â\\x80\\x9d inquired the lad with astonishment. â\\x80\\x9c Pretty much,â\\x80\\x9d returned the old gentleman, laughing. â\\x80\\x9c I very rarely go far away, at all events ; and donâ\\x80\\x99t you think itâ\\x80\\x99s a very nice place too ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I like this room, sir, and I like you,â\\x80\\x9d answered Dick ; â\\x80\\x9c but I dont like Darkendim Street, nor that smell of old straw down stairs.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Smell of old straw !â\\x80\\x9d replied the other. â\\x80\\x9c Why, what a strange boy you are. I never smell any old straw. What fancies lads do take into their giddy heads ! You must dismiss all that, Richard, you know ; for after a day or two, when I have seen what sort of an accountantTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 6!) you make, you will be put in the packing department under your brother Adolphus. Lorâ\\x80\\x99 bless you, lad, you will get to like the old house in time so much that there will be no getting you away from it.â\\x80\\x9d Dick thought within himself, that although he should get to be as old as the Babylon brick, this would never happen, but he kept the reflection within his own bosom. â\\x80\\x9c And now, my boy, we must not waste our time any longer ; please to add up all these several sums in that sheet yonder, and see if you can verify the amounts which I have in my desk.â\\x80\\x9d So Dick was set to work, and laboured on assiduously till four oâ\\x80\\x99clock, at which hour Mr. Ingram Arbour came in with his hat on, and after having received a favour 172 able account of his nephewâ\\x80\\x99s exertions, bade him get ready, and come along with him to Golden Square. His Uncle and Adolphus walked on rapidly together, and the boy trotted behind them, confused by the un 172 accustomed throng and din, and keeping to the heels of his unanxious relatives only with the greatest difficulty. After a most exciting run of forty minutes, diversified by perils of crossings, stupendous in Dickâ\\x80\\x99s Arcadian eyes, he arrived at his new home. Golden Square, as most people know, is not a very cheerful spot, from whatever point of view it is regarded ; but when approached from the Begent Street side, as it chanced to be in the present instance, it appears, by contrast to that thoroughfare, more especially sombre. The scanty snow too, which still lay here and there on the spouts of the houses and on the brinks of the gutters,70 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, intensified the general gloom ; and the whole impression given to poor Dick, fresh from Eose Cottage, was, that Golden Square was little better than Darkendim Street. A pretty waiting-maid opened the door, and a nice-look 172 ing, and rather stately old lady received them in the hall with a curtsy, and kissed Eichardâ\\x80\\x99s cheek. â\\x80\\x9c Excuse the liberty, young sir,â\\x80\\x9d said she; â\\x80\\x9cbut I have been a great many years in your good uncleâ\\x80\\x99s house, and my heart is drawn towards those that are of his kith and kin.â\\x80\\x9d Dick returned the salute wdth cordiality, as became his genial nature, and was about to extend the sphere of his benevolence to the younger female, when Adolphus, touching his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s sleeve, drew his attention to that circumstance, and Mr. Ingram Arbour roared out : â\\x80\\x9c What are you about, sir ?â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9c How old, in the name of all the vices, is that boy ! Take him into the house 172 keeperâ\\x80\\x99s room, Mrs. Trimming, and let him have his tea and cold meat with youâ\\x80\\x94that is to say if you are not afraid of the young dog. It will never do for a child like that to be dining late every day.â\\x80\\x9d With this somewhat inconsistent speech, the master of the house and his myrmidon ascended to the upper floors, and the old lady having conducted the lad into a comfortable little sitting-room below the level of the street-pavement, set before him a handsome piece of cold beef and a jug of ale; after which she surveyed him admiringly, through her silver spectacles, for the space of a minute, and then deliberately kissed him again.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 71 CHAPTER THE EIGHTH. GOLDEN SQUARE. Eor the first week, Richard Arbour bore his transporta 172 tion to town with equanimity ; he liked Mr. Mickleham and Mrs. Trimming, and saw little of his uncle and brother. When they went down, at the end of the week, to Rose Cottage, leaving him in Golden Square, he thought it rather hard ; but the old housekeeper was so kind, and Betsy so tender, that he was not so very mise 172 rable after all. But after this exile had lasted for some ten weeks or so, and shifted from the pattern-room to the packing department, he had been exposed day after day to the insolence and cruelty of Adolphus, he began to find life in Darkendim Street irksome indeed. Appeals to the head of the firmâ\\x80\\x94who was of opinion that all complaints from inferiors against their superiors were alike frivolous and vexatiousâ\\x80\\x94he soon found were utterly fruitless; and as for praise from that quarter for the things that he did well and dutifullyâ\\x80\\x94he might as well have looked for apricots upon a clothes-prop. Mr. Ingram Arbour, who was by no means loth to receiveRICHARD ARBOUR; OR, the harvest of a well-spent life himself from the general public, in such titles as Prudent, Well-to-do, Indepen 172 dent, Respectable and the like, had never been known to bestow a grain of it in the way of encouragement of other people. He prided himself too much upon his practical character to have any respect for the value of fair words. He had become possessed of a foolish saying against them in the connection with the buttering of parsnips, and thought himself rather a philosopher in its application. Most men who are much addicted to proverbs are mentally short-sighted, and our seller of chinaware was in that way a perfect Solomon at second 172 hand. â\\x80\\x9cA straw will shew us which way the wind blows,â\\x80\\x9d says the common-place sage, and never takes into account the place where he finds the straw, and the thousand eddies wherein it is like to be whirled by cur 172 rents of which he never dreams. Uncle Ingram and Nephew Richard drifted further and further away from one another daily on the freezing sea of mutual discontent, and we may he sure that a breath from a certain quarter was not wanting to make matters worse between them. Dick, who was a sharp ladâ\\x80\\x94for all that Messrs. Dot and Carriwun thoughtâ\\x80\\x94could unlock a ward or two of his brotherâ\\x80\\x99s character already, and with the imprudence of his years had made Adolphus aware of this pro 172 ficiency. He had been so indiscreetâ\\x80\\x94in a certain alter 172 cation at the office concerning the breakage of some little Etruscan pitchersâ\\x80\\x94as to remind that young man of Betsyâ\\x80\\x99s having boxed his ears one day, within Dickâ\\x80\\x99sTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 73 hearing, and doubtless for provocation received; and that in a tone of voice which might have been heard in the sentry-box, had Uncle Ingram chanced to be on guard there. Adolphus smiled contemptuously upon the absurd libel at the time, but two chinamen who had been heard to giggle behind a crate, lost their situations, for misconduct, within the week, nor in the end was the disclosure a laughing matter to anybody. Mr. Joseph Surface never likes that decent screen to be thrown down w\\'hich so often stands in the corner of his apartment, whether Lady Teazle be really concealed behind it or not. On the second Saturday that Eichard was left alone in Golden Square, Mrs. Trimming entertained company. The respect which Mr. Ingram Arbour evidently had for that lady was so high, that Eichard never doubted but that the dining-room was used by her that night instead of her own apartment with his full permission ; and, indeed, she looked so â\\x80\\x9csuperiorâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cgenteelâ\\x80\\x9d on the evening in question, that nobody would have ventured to dispute her privilege to sit wherever she pleased. She had a black silk gown on, which stood out in its own right without the aid of crinoline, like card 172 board ; and the lace that she wore voluminously about her was of that faded, not to say dingy complexion, which is known (very familiarly) as Old Point. The expression upon Mrs. Trimmingâ\\x80\\x99s features, too, was gala 172 like to an extraordinary degree upon this night of her reception. Dick hardly recognised the staid and stately housekeeper in the animated and joyous old lady who superintended Betsy as she set out supper upon the74 EicHAED aeboue; OB, mighty dining-tableâ\\x80\\x94for three. One person only, then, was to come to supper. The boy had expected a dozen guests at least, so tremendous had been the preparations. Who could this distinguished visitor be ? thought he, for the sake of whom he had been adjured to put on his Sunday clothes, and in whose honour Betsy wore as many ribbons as would have served a recruiting partyâ\\x80\\x94 which, indeed, perhaps she was. When all the arrangements were completed to her satisfaction, and the clock struck 9 P.M., Mrs. Trimming seated herself before the fire with her feet on the fender, and her silk gown furled like a banner on her lap in the attitude of expectation. â\\x80\\x9c Betsy,â\\x80\\x9d said she, with great distinctness, â\\x80\\x9c when Mr. Jonesâ\\x80\\x94Mr. Jones, you knowâ\\x80\\x94knocks at the door, tell him who is here; tell him, before he enters, that Master Bichard does him the honour of supping with us to-night.â\\x80\\x9d Dick looked at the raised pie and the lobster upon the well-furnished table, and protested with sincerity that for his part he esteemed it a real pleasure to sup with Mr. Jones. His politeness had hitherto prevented him from speaking of the expected visitor, but mention having thus been made of him, he ventured to ask whether Mr. Jones was a nice man. â\\x80\\x9cA nice man!â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated the old lady, with a sudden flush upon her wrinkled countenance. â\\x80\\x9c Oh, I forgot; you do not know him; how should you, my poor boy ? Well, he is generally considered rather nice, I believe; is he not, Betsy?â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 75 â\\x80\\x9c 0 yes, maâ\\x80\\x99am,â\\x80\\x9d replied that domestic ; â\\x80\\x9c he is so beautiful, and so genteel-like, and so kind; and then thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing like pride about Mr. Jones neither, who has been everywhere, and done such a many things. In fact, for my partâ\\x80\\x94though Iâ\\x80\\x99m only a servant, maâ\\x80\\x99am, and no judgeâ\\x80\\x94I never set eyes on any person to at all come up to Mr. Jones in any way.â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Trimming rubbed her white hands softly to 172 gether, and nodded her head, as if keeping time with these commendations; and when they were concluded, looked at Dick with sparkling eyes, as though she would ask him what he thought of Mr. Jones now. It is a little difficult to be enthusiastic about people that we have never seenâ\\x80\\x94although, judging from the expectations of many persons in all classes of society, it would seem to be one of the easiest performances of the human mindâ\\x80\\x94and Dick could only reiterate his satis 172 faction at the opportunity which was about to be afforded to him of making the acquaintance of this paragon. â\\x80\\x9c Thatâ\\x80\\x99s his step, Betsy,â\\x80\\x9d cried the old lady suddenly : â\\x80\\x9c run to the door, Betsy ; quick.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Please, maâ\\x80\\x99am, I think itâ\\x80\\x99s only the pleaceman asâ\\x80\\x9d The old lady shook her head with a smile, as a double rap at the door, which seemed to shake the house, and give the Square assurance of a gentleman, cut short this incredulous speech. â\\x80\\x9c I think I ought to know his step by this time,â\\x80\\x9d quoth Mrs. Trimming tenderly. There was a little whispering in the hall, interrupted76 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, by a â\\x80\\x9cNever mind, Betsy ; who the dickens cares?â\\x80\\x9d in ringing cheery tones ; and in strode the guest of the evening. He was a handsome well-built young man enough, of some nine-and-twenty years of ageâ\\x80\\x94unless his genial manner lightened him of a year or twoâ\\x80\\x94but not of such a surpassing loveliness, as Dick thought, as to excuse Mrs. Trimming, at her time of life, for throwing her arms round his neck and kissing him on both his cheeks. â\\x80\\x9c Mr. Jones is a very old friend of mine,â\\x80\\x9d observed she in extenuation, and when she had got back her breath again. â\\x80\\x9c I daresay you thought it very odd that I should do such a thing as that, Master Bichard, and odder still that such a handsome young fellow should salute me again.â\\x80\\x9d Dick gallantly hastened to say, that he saw nothing out of the course of nature in the proceeding, at all, for that he himself cherished the remembrance of that embrace which had been bestowed upon him by Mrs. Trimming on the day of Ms arrival most warmly : whereat Mr. Jones observed, approvingly, that he was a jolly little chap, and the three sat down to supper, excellent friends. There was, however, one disturbing thought in the mind of Dick that came between his appetite and the raised pie, and interfered with his acquaintanceship with the lobster again and again ! Where had he seen this Mr. Jones before, and under what previous circum 172 stances ? He could not have been the medical gentle 172 man who had ushered Mm into the world thirteen yearsTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 77 ago and more, for that would have presumed him to have obtained the right of exercising that delicate function at the early age of fifteen or sixteen ; and besides, Dick had always heard that Dr. Babbieombe had been the master of that situation ; and yet it was somehow with a baby that Mr. Jones was associated in Dickâ\\x80\\x99s mind. With a baby and with a baptismâ\\x80\\x94yes, so far so good ; but not with his baptism, for the parson of the parishâ\\x80\\x94as there was a silver mug at home with that reverend gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s name upon it to proveâ\\x80\\x94had â\\x80\\x9cstoodâ\\x80\\x9d for him, as second sponsor, and not Mr. Jones. Dick was endeavouring to remember whether he had ever been at the christening of anybody else except himself, when the mysterious stranger cut short his meditations with, â\\x80\\x9c Come, young gentleman, let us have a glass of wine together.â\\x80\\x9d The voice was entirely strange to him, and seemed to break the spellâ\\x80\\x94to loosen and throw into confusion the links out of which his memory was striving to construct a connected chain. It was good, however, to listen to Mr. Jones for other reasons. For so apparently young a man, his experience was amazingly large, and whatever he had to tell of, he narrated well, and even brilliantly. He had been a sailor ; and he made Dick long for the blue expanse of ocean lying dreamy under the tropic sky, and anon, wild with fury, climbing, white-lipped, up the reeling vesselâ\\x80\\x99s side ; he spoke of the islands of the West, where fruit, and flower, and bird were, as Dickâ\\x80\\x99s literature led him to believe, as they ought to be, till the lad longed for those Eden78 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, bowers, and loathed the tethered and inadventurous life that he himself was doomed to lead. Betsy, who had tacitly obtained permission to remain in the room, drank in these wonders with open mouth and eyes ; and Mrs. Trimming listened to them with the delighted look of one whose admiration is too great to give place to interest, and who draws her proudest pleasure from the rapt faces of her fellow-listeners. Thus the time swiftly passed, and it was nigh midnight when Mr. Jones suddenly rose up, exclaiming : â\\x80\\x9cYou have made me chatter so that I have clean forgotten my pipe. I suppose I may go down stairs as usual?â\\x80\\x9d Master Bichard Arbour took up his chamber candle 172 stick with a sigh. â\\x80\\x9c Would you like to keep me company, young gentle 172 man ?â\\x80\\x9d observed the visitor, perceiving his disinclination to depart. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I was your age, I smoked a pipe myself. Let him sit up for me, instead of Betsy, madam, and lock the front door after me ? We shanâ\\x80\\x99t be twenty minutes altogether.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Oh, please do let me, Mrs. Trimming,â\\x80\\x9d entreated the lad. To which the old lady replied, first, that nothing could induce her to suffer anything of the sort to be done, and that if it was done, she would be unworthy to fill the responsible situation which she occupied in that household for ever afterwards ; and secondly, that she could never refuse Mr. Jones anything, and that his young friend might do as he liked. So the two retired to Mrs. Trimmingâ\\x80\\x99s ordinaryTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 79 sitting-room ; and Mr. Jones not only filled his own pipe with a pleasant hut powerful mixture of tobacco, but endowed Master Eichard with another, furnished with Turkish Latakia, or, as he himself expressed it â\\x80\\x9cmotherâ\\x80\\x99s milk.â\\x80\\x9d Under the influence of this novel narcotic and Mr. Jonesâ\\x80\\x99 stirring narrations, the lad passed much such an evening as an imaginative young Persian may be supposed to do on his first introduction to hashis. Only whenever Mr. Jones made pause, if it were but to take a momentary sip at his gin and water, and the voice of the charmer ceased, again Dickâ\\x80\\x99s brain would revert to the inquiry of, Where have I seen this man before, and how is it that I know that face so well ? He had certainly seen him christened, or at a christening â\\x80\\x94that was a settled matter, and might be put aside ; but had he not also seen him being married, or giving in marriage somebody else? Nay, at a funeral, tooâ\\x80\\x94it couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been at papaâ\\x80\\x99s funeral, for Dick had been but a baby when that happenedâ\\x80\\x94but at some funeral, somewhere, he had most certainly beheld Mr. Jones, with his hat off, standing by the grave-side in the open air The front door was open, and the cold night-wind blowing freely upon his brow when Dick got thus far. â\\x80\\x9cYou feel better now, lad?â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Jones was saying, in the voice that was so strange to the ladâ\\x80\\x99s earâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c you feel better now, donâ\\x80\\x99t you? You should never swallow your smoke, my young friend, nor drink your gin and water out of the spoon. Good-niglit, Dick ; I shall see you again soon. Now, mind, when I shut the door, you must put up the chain directly. There !â\\x80\\x9d80 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, A tremendous bang echoed through the houseâ\\x80\\x94the protest of a respectable door, bearing such a name as Ingram Arbour upon it, at being unlawfully slammed at three oâ\\x80\\x99clock upon a Sabbath morningâ\\x80\\x94and Master Eichard reached his sleeping-apartment by a series of tackings and lurches, and got into bed with his boots on.THE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 81 CHAPTER THE NINTH. THE LAST DAY AT HOME. It is not necessary to set forth how, day by day and hour by hour, the manner of Dickâ\\x80\\x99s life in London grew more and more repulsive to him. Judgment will pro 172 bably be given against him by those who read, as it was by those who saw, for the worldâ\\x80\\x99s sympathy for young gentlemen in similar plight is rarely to be awakened by any medium short of that of the police courts. That Richard was not treated by Uncle Ingram, or even by Adolphus, as the apprentices of Mrs. Brownrigg were by that famous lady, is true enough. He had plenty to eat and drink, and a great-coat in the winter-time. There were many thousand lads in the stony metropolis very much worse off than he, who yet remained patiently in that station of life to which the guardians of their parish had bound them. We are neither advocates of, nor apologists for our young friend, although we take leave to pity him. Since the Dicks of flesh and blood have failed from the commencement of society to justify themselves in the eyes of mankind, it is not probable82 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, that this pen-and-ink creation of ours will fare any better. When Dick suspends relations with China, as it is clear he will, he must needs afford to the public eye the very improper and unmitigated spectacle of an apprentice running away from his indentures. Maria, with her universal panacea of â\\x80\\x9c Whip him, whip him well !â\\x80\\x9d will be supported in that recommendation by the general voice ; and there is no help for it. Still, if we were great orators to move menâ\\x80\\x99s minds, like Messrs. Edwin James, or Montague Chambers, we would fain plead something for a little runaway lad scarce thirteen (gentlemen of the jury), a handsome curly-haired youth (good ladies), brought up hitherto almost at his motherâ\\x80\\x99s apron-strings, and loving her and Sister Maggie, and all who were decently kind to him, transplanted from his home-garden, and set among a wilderness of grown-up trees, bringing forth fruits of Assiduity, Economy, Punctuality, after their kind, but with only some three blossoms of Goodwill among them, and not one bud of Love. Against which blossoms, too â\\x80\\x94namely, Mrs. Trimming, Mr. Mickleham, and Mr. Jonesâ\\x80\\x94must be set a couple of Upas-trees (for when our hearts are touched, gentlemen of the jury, our tongue naturally flies to metaphor)â\\x80\\x94the cold dislike of Uncle Ingram, and the malicious hatred of Brother Adolphus. When June came in, in fact, and set up her hideous parody of leaf and verdure in Golden Square, Dick could not stand it any longer. He could not have stood it so long but for two things. One of these was,THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 83 tliat every Saturday and Sunday his natural relatives took themselves away, and left him, and Mr. Jones, the inscrutable, came to sup, and sometimes dine with Mrs. Trimming. This gentleman was Dickâ\\x80\\x99s ideal of what a man should he, and he sat at his feet with never- tiring ears, learning to smoke, and improving in his method of drinking gin and water. Mr. Jones, too, liked Dick in return, and gave him not a few practical proofs of his regard, although, of late, these had certainly been getting rarer. He took him on one occasion to the Pantomimeâ\\x80\\x94passing by the box-office without pay 172 ment, and thereby increasing his young protegeâ\\x80\\x99s admira 172 tion for him to the highest degree ; and when the spring arrived, he introduced him to Cremorne, where Mr. Jones seemed to have a large circle of acquaintances, and to be especially a favourite among the ladies, though we are bound to say that the evening in question was not that famous one upon which no female was admitted beneath the rank of a baronetâ\\x80\\x99s wife. On Sundays, too, Mr. Jones would sometimes take both Mrs. Trimming and Dick to the Zoological Gardens in the Eegentâ\\x80\\x99s Park, where the lad most thoroughly enjoyed himself. Except that the animals were in cagesâ\\x80\\x94which he secretly thought ought to be dispensed withâ\\x80\\x94he deemed the place quite, comparable with the garden inhabited by our first parents. His dream of life was to be employed upon those premises, and to live in the charming little cottage by the turnstile all his days. The cottage had Eaves, but at that period of his life, Dick did not see the necessity for one of those.84- RICHAKI) ARBOUR ; OR, â\\x80\\x9c How is it, Mr. Jones, that such few people seem to come to this delightful spot?â\\x80\\x9d observed he one day, when (after a long cessation from such treats) the two were in the monkey-house, employed in the charitable distribution of nuts to the most deserving objects of that pitiable tribe. â\\x80\\x9cNobody can get in on Sunday without a ticket,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Jones, â\\x80\\x9c and the number of tickets is limited.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Are they very expensive ?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Dick, with a secret determination of hoarding up his sixpence a week of pocket-money until the required sum should be amassed. â\\x80\\x9c They are not to be bought with money,â\\x80\\x9d answered Mr. Jones: â\\x80\\x9cthat gentleman in the comer yonder pre 172 sented me with my free admission-card.â\\x80\\x9d He pointed to an enormous ape swinging by his tail from a cross 172 bar, and apparently fast asleep. Dick opened his mouthâ\\x80\\x94not from ear to ear, but the other way : he was astonished, but he had too much respect for his patron to laugh at him. â\\x80\\x9c That gentleman, did you say ?â\\x80\\x9d said the boy, point 172 ing to the oscillating but benevolent donor. â\\x80\\x9cHow curious that seems; dear me !â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Jones tapped the cage-bars with his umbrella handle, and cried : â\\x80\\x9c Ealph, Ealph, how are you ?â\\x80\\x9d The ape undid a coil or two of his tail, and so let himself down to the ground with a speed that would have put to shame the smartest sailor in her Majestyâ\\x80\\x99s fleet. He stretched out the black paw at the end of hisTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 85 long brown arm as far as it would go through the bars, and his teeth rattled like a dice-box while Mr. Jones shook hands with him. â\\x80\\x9cHe is saying that he is very well, and that the weather is beautiful, although a little close,â\\x80\\x9d observed that gentleman. Dickâ\\x80\\x99s delight at the familiarity of this specimen of the brute creation was irrepressible. â\\x80\\x9c Even the animals like Mr. Jones,â\\x80\\x9d thought he, â\\x80\\x9cand no wonder but he did wonder, nevertheless. â\\x80\\x9c The fact is, Dick,â\\x80\\x9d explained his friend, â\\x80\\x9c I gave this creature to the Zoological Society, and they gave me a free ticket to admit friends, by way of acknowledgment.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDid you give this poor fellow away Vâ\\x80\\x99 cried the lad, quite scandalized at the sacrifice. â\\x80\\x9c What could have induced you to part with such a charming, good- tempered â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Take care,â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Jones, â\\x80\\x9c or heâ\\x80\\x99ll have your finger off in half a second, young gentleman : I have seen him snap a finger off just as though it were a radish. I came to possess him in this way : when I was a lad not much older than you, Dick, I was left a menagerie.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Dear me ! â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the lad in a tone of sympathy, and not quite free from the impression that a menagerie was some fine name for an orphan. â\\x80\\x9c I found myself the owner of a travelling wild-beast showâ\\x80\\x94a lord of the fowl and the brute to an extent never dreamed of by Mr. Alexander Selkirk. Elephants and guinea-pigs, ostriches and humming-birds were mine, Dick, besides a glass-box crammed with boa-constrictors. It was a case of Noah and his ark-full, and I did not keep8G RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, my live-stock very much longer than did that patriarch. I went to smash in a very few weeks, my lad, and found myself with nothing in the world but a Gercopithecus En- gythilhia, or Long-tailed Grivetâ\\x80\\x94otherwise my talented friend Kalph hereâ\\x80\\x94whom no creditor was so hardy as to seize. I had no place to keep him, however, except my greatcoat-pocket, so I made a virtue of necessity, and forwarded the interests of Science, by presenting him to the Zoological Society. Never was ape more gifted, never was , Society more charmed. He can hold more nuts in his cheek-pouches than you could win at a shoot- ing-barrow at a fair in half a day. There is no denying that he bites, but we canâ\\x80\\x99t expect perfection in this world. We ainâ\\x80\\x99t perfect ourselves, Dick, are we?â\\x80\\x9d Dick humbly replied that he himself was certainly not perfect, but that Mr. Jones appeared to him to approach the apex of the moral pyramid as nearly as was humanly possible. To which Mr. Jones replied : â\\x80\\x9c Per 172 haps so, lad ; perhaps I do, my boy and patted his head approvingly. That paternal action reminded the lad at once, as by lightning-flash of recollection, that he had seen Mr. Jones in full canonicals performing in some sacred edifice the ceremony of confirmation, but when or where it was, as usual, he was quite unable to recall ; the desire of doing so, however, was so strong upon him that he took no more interest in animal life for the rest of the day, but passed it in a sort of vertigo of reminiscence. The one other thingâ\\x80\\x94besides the mitigating influenceTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 87 of Mr. Jonesâ\\x80\\x94which had hitherto prevented Dick from bidding adieu to commercial life, was the promise that had been held out to him of revisiting Eose Cottage in six months from the beginning of his banishment. It was a cruel edict that had divorced him from home and friends so long ; but it had certainly heightened the fervour of anticipation with which he now looked forward to the holiday. Mr. Ingram Arbour rather took credit to himself for having thus conferred a gratification at an exceedingly cheap rate, and in his rare moments of humour would even banter his nephew upon this very point. He did not understand how any subject should be kept sacred unless connected with religion or money- matters, and treated poor Eichardâ\\x80\\x99s tears as pigs treat pearls. Attacked by his uncle, there was of course no 172 thing left for it but to submit ; but if Adolphus launched a dart of satire at himâ\\x80\\x94a temptation that young man covdd rarely resistâ\\x80\\x94Dick would up with whatever mate 172 rial weapon in the way of book or inkstand lay nearest to his hand, and there was a considerable fracas in the house, with whipping and disgrace to follow. Dick was not of the sort of stuff to be made.a butt of ; and as he grew older and stronger, this pastime of his elder brother began to have something of the danger as well as the excitement about it of a bull-fight or a tiger-hunt. The long-promised Friday, however, did at last dawn upon Dick, in all its July glory ; and he found himself once more at his old home, and in his motherâ\\x80\\x99s arms. She waited for him up in her bed-room, not that she was much more unwell than usual, but because she88 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, could not open wide the doorways of her heart with the unimpulsive Maria looking on. That young lady still ruled at Eose Cottage, a virgin queen as yet without a suitor. Johnnie was away from home, having been articled, at his own request, to an attorney in the neigh 172 bourhood, and was said to be pursuing the study of the law with a relish ; his joy being somewhat diluted, however, by the presence, in the same office, of Mr. William Dempsey, blindâ\\x80\\x94and that but physicallyâ\\x80\\x94only of one eye. Uncle Ingram and Adolphus had some particular business to transact, and were not to come from town until the next morning ; and Maria, who never knew where to stop when among buttered toast, had got one of her tremendous bilious headaches. Every 172 thing, in fact, was as it should be for Dickâ\\x80\\x99s one holiday. â\\x80\\x9c I tell you what, motherâ\\x80\\x94I tell you what, my Maggie,â\\x80\\x9d cried he, in his school-boy jargon, â\\x80\\x9c let us have a lark on the waterâ\\x80\\x94let us spend the livelong day on the dear old river. I will row you both up to the grotto. Put on your things, darlings, now, do ; and, Maggie, donâ\\x80\\x99t forget some cold meat and so on, because it will be so jolly to picnic in the wood, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go and get the boat ready this minute.â\\x80\\x9d Dick, having saluted Jane and Eachel, ran out into the garden like a young horse who iirst feels the turf beneath his heels ; and when he had got the skiff in order, went over all the miniature domain again and again : he crossed the bridge into the rose-garden, and plucked a nosegay apiece for his mother and sister, and climbed up and swung himself on the same willow-treeTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 89 branch that had borne him a hundred times before ; he tried to catch the minnows in the ditch with his pockets handkerchief, but found he had lost some of his dexterity in that savage art since his residence in town ; he caught sight of the brown back of that identical rat which he had watched in and out of the same water-hole for the last half-dozen years ; and when he threw the stone at him, missed him, by half-an-inch, as he had always done before : he marked again the small blue butterflies with speckled under-wings, wheeling about the corner of the osier-bed, and the dragon-flies that lit upon the heads of the tall water-plants, like flames of fire, and while endeavouring to reach them, got into the mud knee-deep, and had to change his trousersâ\\x80\\x94all as of old. By that time, his passengers and cargo were ready, and off they started in the reverse order to that indicated by the poet, Youth at the Helmâ\\x80\\x94for Maggie steered, as she sat by her motherâ\\x80\\x99s sideâ\\x80\\x94and Pleasure, in the person of Hick, at the Prow, or nearly so. With those dear faces shining full upon him, and all the sights and sounds which he loved best in nature upon all sides, he was indeed a happy boy, and scarce the less so because he knew what short-lived joy it needs must be to him ; for his disposition was one that suffered him to make the most of pleasure while its sun was shining, and not to feel the shadow of the coming woe. Under the huge span of the red railway-bridge, while the iron train above them thundered, and shook it as it flew, and past the osier-beds, and in and out the islands at their leisure, paddled the happy three : it seemed as though with e 290 RICILVED ARBOUR ; OR, leaving land, they had left all sombre thoughts and memories behind ; Dick laughed as he had scarcely done for half a year, and now and then, with sudden access of affection, would almost upset the boat in crawl 172 ing to kiss mamma and Maggie. Mrs. Arbour appeared to come once more, after years of submersion, above the surface of existence, and to have her being again, as long ago, in the atmosphere of love. When they entered the great lock-gates, and the boat sunk with the sinking waters, she even volunteered one of those old, old songs which she had once been accustomed to sing within that echoing place ; but recollecting on a sudden in whose dear company it had last been sung in that very spot, her voice broke down, and Maggie had to help her through with it. There are few pleasanter minutes in a river voyage than those spent within the four walls of some cool dark lock, with the blue sky only to be seen, and when the song mingles with the falling waters without, as with an instrument ; nor afterwards is the change less grateful, when the great gates part, as if by magic, noiselessly, and the world is once more let in upon us in its summer splendour. On the other side of the lock, and up a back-stream above a foaming lasher, they perceived the fisherman Wilson, whom the widow would have gladly passed unseen ; but he called out to Master Eichard, and the lad rowed towards him as to a friend and teacher of blithe sports, of old. â\\x80\\x9c I am glad to see you, sir,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9c and Miss Maggie, and good Mrs. Arbour also. I know that it wasTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 91 not of her kind heart that I was obliged to leave her cottage, and that I now fish from shore because I have no punt. Here is a fine trout that you will please to accept, sir, in token of my respect for you and yoursâ\\x80\\x94 or at least some of yours.â\\x80\\x9d Wilson was right in saying that it was not of Mrs. Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s will that he had had notice to quit his cottage ; but he did not know that she had kept him in it for many years by paying his rent for him, whenever he was behindhand, until Maria found it out ; whereupon she told her uncle; and that gentleman, who had not forgotten the manner in which he had been once asso 172 ciated with the Emperor of Morocco, turned the poor fisherman out of doors. This meeting somewhat dashed the spirits of the party for a time, but presently they came upon another pleasure-boat, with which Dick raced, and beat it, and then quite a fleet of swans surrounded them and gave them mimic battle, and in a little all was joy again. Thus the three reached the grotto in the wood, whence welled the crystal spring, and there they dined, with more enjoyment than ever yet did alderman at feast ; and thus, more leisurely, they drifted home, their skiff half-filled with water-lilies, and the feathery heads of rushes, and all the river spoil. It was a golden day, not likely to be soon forgotten by any of those three, and to be treasured up by one of them for everâ\\x80\\x94a home-picture hung in the inner chamber of his soul, evoking, like the image of a saint, all purest thoughts wheneâ\\x80\\x99er he looked upon it !92 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, CHAPTEE THE TENTH. DICK CUTS THE PAINTER. Mr. Ingram Arbour had set the space of three months between Dickâ\\x80\\x99s present holiday and his next enfranchise 172 ment from Darkendim Street ; hut it would have been all the same to that young gentleman if the appointed limit had been three years instead, or even thirty. He had made up his mind, in short, so soon as he should return to Golden Square, to run away from it, and upon the Tuesday morning after his visit to Eose Cottage, he put that plan into execution. His preparations were not extensive, but they were complete. He packed up all his necessary clothing in a carpet-bag, along with a Bible which his mother had given him, and carried it a couple of streets off before he called a cab. He had seven-and-threepence in his pocket in hard cash; a capital knife, with six blades, given to him by Dr. Babbicombe at his baptism, in the character of sponsor, as being a more useful present to a young man in the end than a silver one ; and three-quarters of an enor 172 mous cake which Jane had made for his especial benefit. He possessed money, arms, and provisions, in short, as a thoroughly equipped exploring-party should do, andTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 93 started in the highest spirits in pursuit of that shifty thingâ\\x80\\x94a London livelihood. Once only, when he stopped the cabman to drop a letter into a post-office, his face wore rather a grave expression; but leaving the solitude of the interior of the cab, and climbing up beside the driver, he soon recovered, in that cheerful company, considerably more than equanimity. No wonder that the thought of that letter made him sad : it was addressed to his mother, and ranâ\\x80\\x94in by no means parallel linesâ\\x80\\x94to this effect : â\\x80\\x9cMy Dearest Motherâ\\x80\\x94I have run away from the crockery business, and turned my hand to another pro 172 fession which I hope to like better. I could not stand it any longer from Adolphus and Uncle Ingramâ\\x80\\x94espe 172 cially Adolphusâ\\x80\\x94I could not indeed. I cannot write what I have suffered for the last six months ; but if you knew, oh, I know you would pity and forgive me, mother. I have got a new situation, so donâ\\x80\\x99t fear, and I will write to you sometimes, I will indeed. And whatever you do, dearest mother and Maggie do not believe what Adolphus and Uncle Ingram say against me. I have got your Bible with me, with your dear handwriting in it. You will never, never be out of my thoughts, you two.â\\x80\\x94Believe me, in spite of tins, dear mother, your loving sonâ\\x80\\x94B. Arbour.â\\x80\\x9d The appointment which Dick thus spoke of was not a government one, but had been conferred upon him solely upon his own merits, and in consequence of his personal application. He had seen, some days ago, a neatly executed placard in a hair-dresserâ\\x80\\x99s shop-window94 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, near to Leicester Square, stating that a Genteel Youth of Good Address was wanted within, to assist in the Cutting Department, and he had applied for the situa 172 tion upon the spot. â\\x80\\x9c Why, you are not much past fifteen, my lad ?â\\x80\\x9d had been the expostulation of Mr. Tipsaway the proprietor. â\\x80\\x9c Not much,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick, not thinking it necessary to state that he was even short of that age of discretion ; â\\x80\\x9c but I am exceedingly genteel, I do assure you.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd youâ\\x80\\x99ve got a good address, too, I suppose,â\\x80\\x9d observed the barber sardonically. Dick only shook his curly hair and showed his teeth â\\x80\\x94as the poor Italian organ-boys do when we wave them away with our savage British hands from the summit of our dining-room Yenetian blindsâ\\x80\\x94and, as it happened, no verbal reply could have served him better. â\\x80\\x9cHe has some modesty, then,â\\x80\\x9d observed the perru 172 quier to his consort. â\\x80\\x9c I think he will do very well to send out to the Ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 Schools,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mrs. Tipsaway critically. Whatever Mrs. Tipsaway thought, Mr. Tipsaway always acted upon, and Mr. Bichard Arbour had there 172 fore obtained admittance into their fashionable establish 172 ment upon trial. He had promised to be at his post-â\\x80\\x94 whatever that might meanâ\\x80\\x94upon the ensuing Tuesday, and he arrived there with his cake and carpet-bag at the appointed hour. The barber and his wife were perfectly well aware that Master Bichard Smith, as he called himself, was a young gentleman who had run away from home, andTIIE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 95 were all the more glad to have him from that circum 172 stance. Such an escapade on his part was of more value to them than the most respectable references, of which of course lie liad none : if, they argued, he was found out and taken back again, they would either obtain hush-money from his family, or the affair would be made public and their establishment advertised ; if not, his appearance in their Saloons would be certainly advantageous. The apartments thus denominated were three cham 172 bers of small extent, furnished with that peculiar skim 172 piness and inefficiency which distinguish the saloons of diminutive steamboats, and with an enormous basin upon wheelsâ\\x80\\x94in two of themâ\\x80\\x94in lieu of a table, which carried out the nautical parallel still further. The fire 172 places in all these rooms smoked throughout the winter â\\x80\\x94although Mr. Tipsaway would declare upon his word of honour, when any complaint was made, that it was only a particular quarter of the west wind or the east wind, as the case might be, which caused that unpre 172 cedented misfortune ; and in one of them the customers were allowed to smoke, a large proportion of whom happened, for certain reasons, to\\'be foreigners, who would not otherwise perhaps have patronized the place. â\\x80\\x9cIn that comparatively small apartment, sir,â\\x80\\x9d ob 172 served Mr. Tipsaway to his young recruit, on introducing him to the premisesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cin that comparatively small apartment, are not seldom to be seen some of the most exalted personages in the history of European politics ; the bulwarks of continental liberty, the apostles of that96 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, sacred gospel of Equality between man and maÂ¡nâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 What the deuce do you mean, Frizzle, by running against me in that fashion?â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated Mr. Tipsaway suddenly, as a pale young man, in a white apron and shirt-sleeves, and carrying an enormous can of water, stumbled upon them in the dark and narrow passage that shut off the shop from the saloons. â\\x80\\x9c Do you know who you are, sir, and who I am ? A pretty example of respect and subordination, Frizzle, you are setting to this young man here. Why isnâ\\x80\\x99t this gas-jet lighted, which I have ordered to be done every morning without fail ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Please, sir,â\\x80\\x9d explained the trembling Frizzle, â\\x80\\x9c Mrs. Tipsaway saidâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Silence, sir,â\\x80\\x9d thundered the proprietor ; â\\x80\\x9c how do you dare to interrupt me when I am speaking. Go along with you, and be more careful in future not to turn your cans over your betters.â\\x80\\x94Where was T, my young friend,â\\x80\\x9d added the barber, dropping his voiceâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9c where was I, when that idiot ran up against me ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c At the sacred gospel of Equality between man and man,â\\x80\\x9d suggested Dick with simplicity. â\\x80\\x9cExactly so,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Tipsaway, whose oratory had been a good deal quenched by the cold water. â\\x80\\x9c Well, the short and long of it is, the refugees and such like meets here pretty often, and talks all kinds of lingo. One of â\\x80\\x99em canâ\\x80\\x99t talk at all, howeverâ\\x80\\x94Count Gotsucha- koff, the Russian gentâ\\x80\\x94he as is a coming through the shop at this instant. Now, just you look at him.â\\x80\\x9d Dick did look at him, as at the first Count whom his hitherto unprivileged eye had ever beheld, and thisTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 97 is what he saw ; a tall dark sallow man, of about fifty years of age, without a vestige of hair upon his face, and that upon his head cut down to mere gray bristle : he had that painful look of enforced watchfulness about him which only belongs to the deaf and dumb, as though they were solicitous not to lose the play of a single muscle in the countenances of their more fortunate fellow-creatures : upon the left breast of his high-buttoned black waistcoat, there depended about three-halfpenny 172 worth of red ribbon, the termination of whichâ\\x80\\x94doubtless the order of the Golden Eagle, or other costly bird of his native landâ\\x80\\x94was lost in a little side-pocket. As he walked through the shop, he lifted his hat to Mrs. Tips- away, who stood behind the counter, an act of conde 172 scension which delighted Dick, and even elicited from Mr. Tipsawayâ\\x80\\x94who was accustomed to itâ\\x80\\x94a cordial expression of praise. â\\x80\\x9c Heâ\\x80\\x99s the politest beggar, is the Count, Smith, as ever you see. Heâ\\x80\\x99ll bow to me, and even to you, now, when he comes in, just as though we were counts ourselves.â\\x80\\x9d In another moment the Russian nobleman had entered the smoking room, where the two were standing, and saluted them in the magnificent and courtly manner which had been predicted. â\\x80\\x9c How are you, Old Starch-and-Stiff ? â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Tipsaway, throwing, however, a most marked respect into his features â\\x80\\x9c Will you have a glass of the same tipple as usual, and smoke your cabbage-leaf till the other noble swells make their appearance, eh ?â\\x80\\x94You see, Smith,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the barber, observing the extreme dismay de- F98 RICHARD AEBOUBj OB, picted in Dickâ\\x80\\x99s countenance, â\\x80\\x9c it do nâ\\x80\\x99t signify tuppence what one says to a deaf-and-dumb cove like this ; one may just as well call him â\\x80\\x98Old hoyâ\\x80\\x99 as â\\x80\\x98Your excel 172 lency in fact, it would be throwing fine words away, and putting oneâ\\x80\\x99s self out of oneâ\\x80\\x99s usual way for nothing.â\\x80\\x9d Upon this explanation the unfortunate count smiled a smile of the most courteous approval, and seating himself at the table, produced a little parcel of tobacco and a small volume, consisting of thin brown paper, out of which raw materials he began constructing cigarettes. â\\x80\\x9c How deuced sharp he is with his fingers!â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Tipsaway admiringly. â\\x80\\x9c Iâ\\x80\\x99m hanged if he ainâ\\x80\\x99t a precious deal more like a monkey than a man. You should see him presently when the others come in and talk their lingo ; here heâ\\x80\\x99ll sit for hours, bless you, smok 172 ing and rolling, rolling and smoking, and making believe to listen, just as though he were all right, you know. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a very patient chap, that I must say for him. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s your Hodervee, countâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s what he would call brandy, if he could speak, you knowâ\\x80\\x94and do keep to the spitoon, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a good creatureâ\\x80\\x94heâ\\x80\\x99s an awful creetur for that, is the count, and vexes my wife most amazing. They say he can spectorate over his own head, as he sits in his chair, but I canâ\\x80\\x99t say as I ever saw him do it. But now we must clear out of this, for here comes Monsieur de Crespigny, and Herr Singler, and the rest of the foreign gents, who like to be by themselves here, and have no fancy for listeners.â\\x80\\x9d This delicacy on the part of Mr. Tipsaway must not be estimated at too high a rate, considering that if he hadTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 99 applied his ear to the keyhole of the smoking saloon with ever so great an assiduity, he would never have heard anything hut tongues which he did not happen to he able to translate. It would have been a dangerous method of studying foreign pronunciation, too, for the barber was right enough in describing his guests as im 172 patient of eaves-droppers. In that small smoky backroom of the unconscious haircutter, certain determinations were now and then arrived at, important enough, and the divulging of which would have brought death or ruin on many an innocent head hundreds of miles away. That wretched room had been the hatching place of many an abortive plot for the confusion of Tyrants, and even the nursery of more than one rickety Constitution. It was less convenient for the enjoyment of social life, it is true, than for the arrangement of conspiracies, but those who used it had been drivenâ\\x80\\x94as they thought by an arbitrary and vindictive handâ\\x80\\x94-from country, and home, and friends, and all things that give life a wholesome relish, and had their minds solely setâ\\x80\\x94firmly and savagely as a man sets his teethâ\\x80\\x94upon wrongs to be righted, and cruelties to be avenged. No foreign spy would have dreamed of invading Mr. Tipsawayâ\\x80\\x99s quiet emporium, for it is notorious that mouchards are entirely without sense of humour, which, and which alone, might have led them to look with grave suspicion upon the fact of a number of gentlemen, whose close-cropped heads had the ap 172 pearance of stubble-fields, frequenting, almost daily, an establishment devoted to cutting and curling. These men, so scant of linen, so saving of soap, had100 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, yet, in Richard\\'s eyes, a certain dignity about them, which Englishmen, similarly stricken by poverty, would perhaps have lacked. When we islanders grow poor, we are apt to cease from being polite, and to regard our fellow- creatures with bitterness ; nor do our shabby hats grow shabbier through too much courteous salutation of the general public ; but a handsome, merry, young face like that of Richard Arbour, was as much a passport to the heart of M. de Crespignyâ\\x80\\x94melancholy as it had grown to beâ\\x80\\x94as when he had been a prosperous gentleman, and leader of the extreme left in the Chamber of Deputies. He congratulated Dick upon his new appointment at Mr. Tipsawayâ\\x80\\x99s, as though he had been some cadet of noble family just gazetted page to the French king ; and thus in a couple of minutes won more of gratitude from the impulsive lad than Uncle Ingram had been able to earn by thirteen years of practical benefits. Oh, great and wonderful powers of human look and speech, that can confer such gracious happiness upon the hearts of others by a mere smile or tone ! and oh, still more wonder 172 ful human blindness and arrogance, that spare to bestow a gift that costs the donor so little ! Although, however, M. de Crespigny â\\x80\\x94 who con 172 versed with Dick in English, of course, never imagining that a lad in his position would understand any other language than his ownâ\\x80\\x94and our young runaway did become fast friends in a few days, it is not to be supposed that the barberâ\\x80\\x99s boy had nothing else to do but to cultivate the acquaintance of foreign noblemen. On the day after his arrival, he was taken in hand by Mr.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 101 Frizzle, a feeble young man, much bullied by Tipsaway, and with an expression of countenance piteous as that of a hunted kangaroo, to which animal he bore a further resemblance in an enormous linen pouch, which he always carried about with him, filled with the implements of his profession. \"Whether Mr. Frizzle had real genius or not, is a question only to be decidedâ\\x80\\x94or rather to be fought about, for they never decideâ\\x80\\x94by the psychological metaphysicians ; but that he had at all events â\\x80\\x9ca turnâ\\x80\\x9d for music, there is no denying. Like other eminent per 172 sons in obscure circumstances, however, who have been attached to that divine calling, he pursued it under many disadvantages ; his principal instrument of melody being the comb kept for the general use of the customers, by help of which and some thin brown curling-paper, he would perform curious pieces of his own compositionâ\\x80\\x94 muffled oratorios : extracting music from the tortoise 172 shell, like Orpheus and the earliest masters of the art. â\\x80\\x9c Frizzle, why donâ\\x80\\x99t you stop that infernal twang 172 ing?â\\x80\\x9d roared Mr. Tipsaway at 11 a.m. from the front shop, on the morrow of Dickâ\\x80\\x99s arrival. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you know that itâ\\x80\\x99s the last Saturday in the month, and that Mr. Smith must be taken to school this morning?â\\x80\\x9d Dick thought with a shudder of Messrs. Dot and Carriwunâ\\x80\\x99s, and his heart sank within him lest the study of the mathematics should be indeed necessary for the hair-cutting line of business, as it seemed to be for every other. â\\x80\\x9c To school, sir!â\\x80\\x9d cried he ; â\\x80\\x9c I have been to school, Mr. Tipsaway, and learned up to vulgar fractions.â\\x80\\x9d102 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, â\\x80\\x9c You will see more of tliem to-day, lad,â\\x80\\x9d grinned the barber, in intense enjoyment of the coming witticism, â\\x80\\x9c than you ever saw in your life before. It is a charity school you are going to this morning, where all the boys may be said to be vulgar fractions. It is the experimen- tum in corpore vili, as my classical friend Herr Singler once observed. You are about to learn hair-cutting upon pauperâ\\x80\\x99s heads, Mr. Richard Smith. The parish authorities have such a belief in our accurate knowledge of the prevailing mode, that they place one hundred and twenty heads at our disposal every six weeks. Frizzle, give him the bluntest pointed scissors that we have in the shop, lest he should abuse the confidence thus reposed in us ; and donâ\\x80\\x99t take any combs there, mind that, for you know what happened once, in consequence, to Mr. Camellair, the artist, who has never since visited our establishment.â\\x80\\x9d Thus it was that Mr. Richard Arbour mastered the rudiments of the science of hair-cutting. His unculti 172 vated fancy was allowed to sow its wild oats in charity- schools and workhouses, among locks for the nourish 172 ment of which no Polar bear is slain, no Pommade de Tipsaivay is concocted ; nay, if truth must be told, he was even lent out gratis upon Sunday mornings to infe 172 rior establishments in low neighbourhoods, nor until he had disfigured many hundreds of the working-classes with his ignorant shears, was he judged worthy to try his â\\x80\\x99prentice hand upon a gentleman. That time, how 172 ever, did at last arrive, and the genteel youth of good address drew customers to the house, as Mr. TipsawayTHE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 103 had anticipated. The lad was a considerable relief to those who had hitherto only experienced the nervous attentions of Mr. Frizzle. That young manâ\\x80\\x94besides his introduction of the foreign body we have already hinted at into the luxuriant tresses of Mr. Camellairâ\\x80\\x94 had been guilty of enormous indiscretions. He had almost driven Major Bantam into an apoplexy by whist 172 ling a melodyâ\\x80\\x94softly but quite perceptiblyâ\\x80\\x94upon a bald spot on that indignant officerâ\\x80\\x99s head, as he stood behind him â\\x80\\x9c thinning his top,â\\x80\\x9d as the phrase goes ; and when Miss Comely Pettigrew had asked him whether he thought that he had a pair of whiskers to suit herâ\\x80\\x94 meaning, of course, those artificial frisettes used for dis 172 tending the side-hairâ\\x80\\x94he had fairly spluttered with laughter, and rushed out of the room. Moreover, his conversationâ\\x80\\x94a most important matter with gentlemen of his professionâ\\x80\\x94was feeble to quite an extraordinary degree. Beyond â\\x80\\x9c The weather is distressingly â\\x80\\x99ot to 172 day, mem,â\\x80\\x9d or, â\\x80\\x9c â\\x80\\x99Ow that chimney do smoke now, to be sure, sir, donâ\\x80\\x99t it ?â\\x80\\x9d he had absolutely nothing to say ; while, in place of introducing the subject of purchases warily and delicately, lie would come out with : â\\x80\\x9c Now, buy a pot of our pommade, sirâ\\x80\\x94do,â\\x80\\x9d as though he were appealing to the pity rather than the self-interest of the customer. The foreign gentlemen, in particular, whose inexpli 172 cable politeness affected the nerves of Mr. Frizzle, were exceedingly glad to be waited upon by Dick instead of him : they did not think it necessary to break off their conversation when the lad chanced to have occasion to104 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, enter their room ; and it must be confessed that he took advantage of that circumstance to drink in as much as his knowledge of the French tongue, imparted to him by Sister Maggie, would permit him. He could not under 172 stand very much, of courseâ\\x80\\x94even when he could trans 172 late itâ\\x80\\x94of their talk about the Solidarity of the Peoples, or of the moment being Supreme for down-trodden Nationalities, but he knew that they were talking secrets, and that he was listening to them, unknown to the speakers, which is a state of affairs gratifying to most people. Moreover, he was deeply interested in the scenes themselves, and the persons who composed them : in his friend and patron, M. de Crespigny, so eloquent and so enthusiastic ; in Herr Singler, so quiet and yet so weighty, that no man put in a word while he was speak 172 ing ; in Signor Castigliano, so scornfully indignant in hand, and voice, and eye ; and of the ten or a dozen conspirators who assembled, all or some, in that little saloon daily, especially in the silent, sullen Count Got- suchakoff, who sat in that stormy parliament, sipping his brandy, and smoking his tobacco, as though he were the sole occupant of the apartment. Now and then, a slip of paper would be handed to him with some pen 172 cilled words, requesting his advice on this or that matter, and he would write his reply on a leaf of his little cigarette-book, with incredible speed. The conspirators had evidently a high opinion of his judgment, and indeed, for five-and-thirty years this exile from St. Petersburg!!â\\x80\\x94banished perhaps for writing what heTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 105 might have spoken with impunity, had he been able to speak at allâ\\x80\\x94had been prompter or participator in half the revolutions of Europe. There was a great attraction and mystery about this man for Dick, who had never chanced to see a deaf-and-dumb person before, and his sharp young eyes were often fixed upon him when the count was by no means aware of it. That gentle 172 man would sometimes stay behind when his friends departed, finishing his eau de vie, and on a certain occa 172 sion, the lad surprised him in the performance of a rather singular action. Dick had opened the saloon-door with unusual quietness, and without the draught or other accompany 172 ing circumstance, such as generally attracted the countâ\\x80\\x99s attention at once, announcing his presence, and behold, there was the Eussian arranging the slips of paper that had been given to him during the conference in his voluminous pocket-book ! This struck Dick as being remarkable, because he had heard M. de Crespigny say that he would warn Count Gotsuchakoff to be particu 172 lar in destroying them, and the count, on receiving the written suggestion, had apparently done soâ\\x80\\x94folding each slip as soon as he had perused it, and consuming it in the gas-jet that was always alight in the room for smoking purposesâ\\x80\\x94not only on that occasion, but ever afterwards, as the lad had seen him do many times. This contradictory circumstance would not, however, of itself perhaps have awakened Dickâ\\x80\\x99s suspicions, had not the Eussian suddenly started up, thrust the pocket- book into his bosom, and seizing the lad by the throat,106 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, uttered in unmistakable French, and with a rolling of the rs beyond the reach of most articulate-speaking menâ\\x80\\x94(not to speak of a deaf-and-dumb gentleman), that one tremendous rage-laden continental shibboleth â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Sacre!!â\\x80\\x99THE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 3 07 CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH. THE PERILS OF EAVESDROPPING. The modesty of talentâ\\x80\\x94provided that it be accompanied with a stock of patienceâ\\x80\\x94is always sure of its reward. If Master Richard Arbour had ever chanced to plume himself among the foreign customers of Mr. Tipsaway, upon his knowledge of the French tongue, it is not unlikely that the moment which found him in the grasp of the Russian count would have been his last. Rage and fear contended in the manâ\\x80\\x99s evil eyes, and blanched his cheek, while his wicked fingers tightened about the poor ladâ\\x80\\x99s throat, as though their trade was murder. Dickâ\\x80\\x99s countenance was rapidly growing black, when he bethought himself of throwing an expressive glance at the table, and of making as though he would reach with one of his hands the pencil that still lay there. He felt convinced that his life depended on the countâ\\x80\\x99s imagin 172 ing that his secret was yet undiscoveredâ\\x80\\x94that he was a deaf and dumb man still in his eyes as in those of the rest of the worldâ\\x80\\x94and therefore, instead of exclaiming : â\\x80\\x9c Oh, spare me, for 1 never meant to find you out or, â\\x80\\x9c Forgive me, count, for discovering that you are an108 RICHARD arbour; or, impostor,â\\x80\\x9d he judiciously confined himself to making signs. The count relaxed his gripe to consider a little, and then released the lad altogether, though taking care to stand between him and the door. Dick took up the pencil and wrote : â\\x80\\x9c I am very sorry to have disturbed you, sir ; I thought you had all left the room, and was coming in to put it straight.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c You lie !â\\x80\\x9d returned the count, in the most delicate and microscopic handwriting that ever was seen. â\\x80\\x9c I also came to see if there was any brandy left,â\\x80\\x9d wrote Dick. This did not happen to be in the least the case, but it was more in accordance with the Eussianâ\\x80\\x99s notion of what was probable, than the simple truth of the other answer. â\\x80\\x9c What did you see ?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Gotsuchakoff, setting down the words with his practised fingers, while he kept his lynx eyes fixed upon the trembling youth. â\\x80\\x9c I saw you, count.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c What else, boy ; what else ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPlease, count, I saw that you had drunk all the brandy.â\\x80\\x9d Gotsuchakoff was evidently at a nonplus. He did not know whether to believe the boy or not. He hesitated as to whether he should push him further, afraid, in case of his being unaware that he had really spoken, of impressing him too much with the importance of what had happened. â\\x80\\x9c And did you not hear anything ?â\\x80\\x9d wrote the count,THE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 109 unable to bear the horrid uncertainty which consumed him. This was the most perilous moment of all to Dick, and luckily the lad was by this time fully aware of it. His features expressed the most extreme bewilderment, and even a touch of drollery. â\\x80\\x9cHear, count?â\\x80\\x9d wrote he, in rather a shaky hand, it must be confessed ; â\\x80\\x9c how should I hear anything, with nobody but you in the room ?â\\x80\\x9d The Russian was looking him through and through with a terrible distrust, but the smile which the lad had conjured up seemed completely to disarm him. He drew a long breath of intense relief, and wiped away the drops that stood upon his pale forehead. He had but uttered a single French word, after all, reasoned he, which, even if distinctly heard, might very well have sounded to the ladâ\\x80\\x99s English ears like the mere guttural exclamation of a dumb man excited to pas 172 sion. At all events, if murder were not to be done, it was better to believe this, and to efface the recollec 172 tion of the whole matter from the boyâ\\x80\\x99s mind as soon as possible. â\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon, young sir,â\\x80\\x9d wrote he ; â\\x80\\x9cI am afraid that I have been taking a little more drink than is good for me. Let us shake hands, and forget this stupid business.â\\x80\\x9d The Russian, to whom a bribe appeared no more unreasonableâ\\x80\\x94and probably much less soâ\\x80\\x94than a friendly present, or a fair commercial exchange, pressed a crown-piece into the hand of the barberâ\\x80\\x99s boy, whose110 EICHAED AKBOÃ\\x9cR ; OR, fingers closed on it mechanically, and abruptly left the room. He had prolonged the interview to the utmost limits consistent with the otherâ\\x80\\x99s safety, for the unnatural tension of Dickâ\\x80\\x99s faculties could be maintained no longer ; he heard the countâ\\x80\\x99s heavy footsteps passing through the front shopâ\\x80\\x94who probably saluted its pro 172 prietor with his accustomed courtesy, for Mr. Tipsawayâ\\x80\\x99s voice replied : â\\x80\\x9c Good bye, old dummy,â\\x80\\x9d doubtless with a smile of great obsequiousnessâ\\x80\\x94and he heard no more ; but fell down, face on the table, in a fainting-fit, thereby upsetting the brandy bottle. The crash of the breaking glass brought Mrs. Tipsaway, who had a housekeeperâ\\x80\\x99s ear for that parti 172 cular noise, directly into the smoking-room ; and her raised voice, for which Mr. T. had a husbandâ\\x80\\x99s ear, at once summoned that gentleman to her assistance. â\\x80\\x9c What do you think of this, Mr. Tipsaway ?â\\x80\\x9d cried she with bitterness, naturally, though somewhat un 172 justly, directing her anger against the only animate object. â\\x80\\x9c What have you got to say for your pet apprentice now ?â\\x80\\x9d Now, it was well known that Dick was rather the pet of the lady than of her husband, but when the female mind is excited, it not uncommonly spurns the trammels of vulgar fact ; and Mrs. Tipsaway kept her own mental powers particularly free and fetterless in that respect. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s as drunk as a young lord,â\\x80\\x9d confessed Mr. Tipsaway apologetically ; â\\x80\\x9c there is not a doubt of that.â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. Ill â\\x80\\x9cAnd what do we want of your young lords here?â\\x80\\x9d inquired the lady with indignation. â\\x80\\x9c Why must you he picking up a young swell like this, who must have his best French brandy, forsooth, and destroy the bottle afterwards, when we might have had a charity-boy as cheap, or cheaper â\\x80\\x9d How they could have got one cheaper, considering that they gave Master Richard Smith just nothing at all, cannot, unfortunately, be here disclosed, for Mrs. Tipsaway pulled herself short up, when she had got thus far, to emit an expression of astonishment, which, in the mouth of a less genteel lady, might have been mistaken for a whistle. â\\x80\\x9cLook here!â\\x80\\x9d cried she, exhibiting the boyâ\\x80\\x99s neck, the cravat of which she had been loosening ; â\\x80\\x9csome 172 body has been trying to throttle the lad. Here are the marks of four fingers and a thumb.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Gotsuchakoff, sacre !â\\x80\\x9d murmured the lad, with his eyes still closed. The barber and his wife exchanged looks of profound terror. â\\x80\\x9cThat lad has been insulting the count, and the foreign gentleman will never come here agaiD, perhaps,â\\x80\\x9d groaned Mr. Tipsaway, to whom the refugees paid a very tolerable sum for the exclusive use of the smoking- saloon. â\\x80\\x9c What have you been doing you young rascal ?â\\x80\\x9d inquired he, at the same time giving his genteel appren 172 tice a tremendous shaking. â\\x80\\x9c What have you been at, sir, eh ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I saw nothing, I heard nothing,â\\x80\\x9d replied poor Dick,112 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, wlio imagined that the Russian was still cross-examining him ; â\\x80\\x9c I only came to put things to rights Oh, itâ\\x80\\x99s you, Mr. Tipsaway, is it?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes, itâ\\x80\\x99s me, you drunken young vagabond, and what then ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhy, hereâ\\x80\\x99s some money that the count left me to pay for the broken glass,â\\x80\\x9d quoth Dick, whose wits were reawakening. â\\x80\\x9c He was awfully drunk though, for all that, I do assure you. He set on me, just because I could not understand his telegraphing, like some wild animal.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c He went through the shop very steadily,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Tipsaway, perceptibly mollified by the silver, but still a little incredulous. â\\x80\\x9c That may do for Mr. T.,â\\x80\\x9d observed the better-half of that gentleman to hersejf, â\\x80\\x9cbut not for me, young gentleman : I heard the glass break after the count left the house.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnyhow, he nearly choked me,â\\x80\\x9d observed Dick pettishly, and adjusting his neckcloth; â\\x80\\x9cand I had rather not have anything more to do with Count Got- suchakoff, please.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Pooh, pooh ! heâ\\x80\\x99ll forget it the next time he comes,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Tipsaway ; â\\x80\\x9c and, besides, you are going to 172 morrow, Smith, to Miss Backboardâ\\x80\\x99s instead of Frizzle, who, she complains, will giggle all the time he is cutting her young ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 hair. The count \\'will not certainly remember his drunken frolic for eight-and-forty hours.â\\x80\\x9d Dick thought within himself, that if Mr. Tipsaway had felt the Russianâ\\x80\\x99s fingers at his own windpipe, heTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 113 would not have described the occurrence quite so play 172 fully ; hut since he had no desire to make the barber his confidant, he affected to be satisfied, and made no further complaint. Mr. Tipsaway, who had heard the muffled oratorio in full performance in the front-shop for several minutes, here rushed away to deprive the musician of his instru 172 ment, which he justly deemed was one that required a curtain or other means of concealment between the player and the general public, at least as much as any organ. Mrs. Tipsaway stayed behind, to lay her hand upon the ladâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder confidentially, and to observe in a motherly tone: â\\x80\\x9cCome, Dick, you must tell me the truth, my lad, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.â\\x80\\x9d Dick knew enough of the character of Mrs. Tipsaway to be aware, that the commission of a secret to her ears would be about equivalent to advertising it in the columns of any local newspaper of tolerable circulation ; so he smiled sweetlyâ\\x80\\x94a thing Dick could always do when conversing with a ladyâ\\x80\\x94and replied with sim 172 plicity : â\\x80\\x9c The whole truth about what, maâ\\x80\\x99am ?â\\x80\\x9d in order to gain time for fictitious composition. â\\x80\\x9c How, donâ\\x80\\x99t aggravate me,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mrs. Tipsawayâ\\x80\\x94 and this time with a dash of piquancy in her accents, less motherly than step-nrotherlyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c for I am doing a hair-chain for a bride-elect, and canâ\\x80\\x99t afford to have my fingers set all of a tremble. What did the count give you that piece of money for, and how came that bottle broken ?â\\x80\\x9d F 2114 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, â\\x80\\x9c I broke tire bottle, Mrs. Tipsaway,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed tlie youth, clasping liis penitent hands. â\\x80\\x9cAnd the money, the money?â\\x80\\x9d cried the lady, stamping her foot. â\\x80\\x9c The count gave me the money for having thrashed me so,- because, becauseâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Because he caught you helping yourself to his brandy,â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Tipsaway, triumphantly finishing the sentence. â\\x80\\x9cAh, yes, maâ\\x80\\x99am. I perceive it is impossible to deceive your sagacity.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThen donâ\\x80\\x99t try it again, Smith, mind thatâ\\x80\\x9d con 172 tinued the lady with emphasis. â\\x80\\x9c Men have tried itâ\\x80\\x94 women have tried itâ\\x80\\x94Frizzle has tried it; but it has never succeeded yet with Martha Tipsaway. It is not very likely, therefore, that a child like you will have much chance. Trust me, boy, and I will take you to my armsâ\\x80\\x94that is to say, of course, you must keep your distance, and not forget that you are the â\\x80\\x99prentice, and I the missis ; but try to deceive me, young gentleman, and youâ\\x80\\x99ll wish yourself one of them figures in the win 172 dow, whose ears cannot feel a box, nor whose mouth appreciate victuals.â\\x80\\x9d With which piece of didactics Mrs. Tipsaway swept out of the room in a whirlwind of silk and cap-strings.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 115 CHAPTER THE TWELFTH. MISS BACKBOARDâ\\x80\\x99S YOUNG LADIES. Miss Backboardâ\\x80\\x99s fashionable seminary for young ladies was situated in a pleasant suburb of the metropolis, and had a strip of garden lying in front of it, bearing the same relation to the house in superficial extent as each of the slices of carpet in the dormitories bore to its respective bed. A holly-tree, significant of Prudence, kept watch at the garden-gate ; the daisy, emblem of Innocence, blushed in its little grass-borders ; the modest violet, at its proper season, indicated, in its own sweet language, the character of the inmates of the establish 172 ment; no red rose cried: â\\x80\\x9cHe is near!â\\x80\\x94he is near!â\\x80\\x9d no white rose wept: â\\x80\\x9cHe is late!â\\x80\\x9d but such of Miss Backboardâ\\x80\\x99s young ladies as had got so far as to think about â\\x80\\x9c himâ\\x80\\x9d at all, were represented in that innocent plot by the unimpatient lily, which whispers, â\\x80\\x9c I wait ;â\\x80\\x9d and, on one side of the gravel-walk that led to the front 172 door, by the acacia-tree, which sighs but of Platonic Love. Only, when Miss Backboard eradicated the wicked iris and the too demonstrative jonquil from her parterre, it was inconsistent of her to spare that Virginian jasmine â\\x80\\x94symbol of separationâ\\x80\\x94which climbed up the entire116 EICHAED ARBOUR; OR, face of the house, and looked down, over the wall, upon the passion-flowers in the next garden. The jasmine might look, hut the young ladies mightnâ\\x80\\x99t. â\\x80\\x9c Not to look out of the window,â\\x80\\x9d was one of the edicts of the Backboardian code, which might, for precautionary severity, have been drawn up by Mrs. Praisegod Barehones, for the benefit of female Cavaliers. Miss Backboard herself, however, was constantly on the watch at one or other of the casements, like Sister Anne on Bluebeardâ\\x80\\x99s tower, and took note of every male creature that came in at the little iron gate. She had already caused two bakersâ\\x80\\x99 boys to be dismissed from their situations, for whistling melodies relating to the affec 172 tions as they approached her house; and a third was even now upon his trial for kissing his hand to her front-windowsâ\\x80\\x94the defence set up by the accused party being, that he was only engaged with his pocket-hand 172 kerchief. The postman was not permitted to intrust his letters for the establishment to any hand but hers; and she winnowed the correspondence thus obtained with a skill and completeness that Sir James Graham and his myrmidons might have envied. A pink envelope, or an envelope with a sealing-wax â\\x80\\x9ckissâ\\x80\\x9d upon it, or with an affectionate motto on its seal, was arrested by her vigilant fingers as a health-officer would seize upon some infected wretch whose escape from quarantine must needs bring death and desolation into a thousand homes. No male handwriting was suffered to pass at all without inquiry of the would-he recipient; and if the serpent who wrote it was no nearer of kin than a bachelor-THE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 117 cousin, the missive was ruthlessly torn up and scattered to the wanton winds. Nor was the export-trade less strictly watched than the import. All letters except to honÃ¢-fide relatives were inspected. Yes ; conscientious Miss Backboard did indeed peruse the whole of the correspondence between the young ladies of her own establishment and their â\\x80\\x9ceternal friendsâ\\x80\\x9d at similar educational seminaries or elsewhere : twice a week that indefatigable female performed the awful task in its completeness, beginning with, â\\x80\\x9c My own dearest, dearest Isabelâ\\x80\\x9d in the middle of the first page, and so, through the slanting shower of affectionate commonplaces to the all-important postcript No. 2. No wonder the good lady was consumed by anxieties, and haggard with sus 172 picions ; no brain could stand such letter-reading twice a week for long. She looked for hidden meanings in sentences wherein the writer had seen no necessity for inserting any meaning at all ; she scorched the missives before the fire, with a view of bringing forth the secrets concealed in lemon-juiee that were never there; she conceived that some crafty cipher lay in the frequent and unnecessary dashes which italicised the general con 172 tents, and imagined elopements and rope-ladders lurked in the very loops of the I s. It was Miss Backboard herself who did Master Bichard Arbour, otherwise Smith, the honour of receiv 172 ing him at her own door-step, having reconnoitred him for several minutesâ\\x80\\x94as a medieval porter might have eyed a stranger knightâ\\x80\\x94before admitting him to even that proximity.118 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, â\\x80\\x9c Whence come you, boy ?â\\x80\\x9d quoth she, in that blank- verse style exceedingly popular with ladies of scholastic pursuits, when their time and tempers permit them to make use of it. â\\x80\\x9cWhence come you, and from whom?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I am the new barberâ\\x80\\x99s boy from Mr. Tipsawayâ\\x80\\x99s, please, maâ\\x80\\x99am.â\\x80\\x9d Miss Backboardâ\\x80\\x99s eagle eye detected in the Genteel Youth too pronounced a gentility. â\\x80\\x9c I mistrust you, boy,â\\x80\\x9d returned she ; â\\x80\\x9c my mind misgives me : do you play a part with, me ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c No, please, maâ\\x80\\x99am, I play nothing. Frizzle plays a good deal, when master will let him; but the only time I ever tried, 1 broke a tooth.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBroke a tooth!â\\x80\\x9d echoed the astonished school 172 mistress; â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what you mean; I donâ\\x80\\x99t see that you have any teeth broken.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c No, please, maâ\\x80\\x99am ; it was only the tooth of the comb that was broken. Frizzle always plays upon a comb. â\\x80\\x9c It cost me eightpence to â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cGood gracious! I hope you donâ\\x80\\x99t bring that comb here ?â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Backboard sharply. â\\x80\\x9c0 no, maâ\\x80\\x99am; that would not be â\\x80\\x98comme il fautâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d smiled Dick, with his best accent. The nature of his mission tickled the lad immensely, and put him in spirits too high for his position. â\\x80\\x9cWhat ! you speak French ?â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the terrified lady. â\\x80\\x9cYou are no barberâ\\x80\\x99s boy.â\\x80\\x9d Â« Perruquier, if you please, madam ; yes, that is what I am. It is essential to our fashionable connec-THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 119 tion, says Mr. Tipsaway, that one, at least, in the estab 172 lishment should have same knowledge of that language. I learned it from my boyhood.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBoyhood!â\\x80\\x9d screamed Miss Backboard. â\\x80\\x9cWhy, what do you call yourself now ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMr. Tipsaway calls me one of his young men, maâ\\x80\\x99am. â\\x80\\x98 One of my young men will be at your house to-day, Miss Backboard,â\\x80\\x99 he wrote, meaning myself; and, indeed, I am more than fourteen years old already.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Fourteen,â\\x80\\x9d murmured the schoolmistress to herself ; â\\x80\\x9cthat is not a dangerous age. Hum! Yes, you may come in.â\\x80\\x9d She ushered him into a small apartment on the right of the entrance, hung round with blank maps and a few unframed landscapes ; a couple of enormous globes filled each a recess on either side of the fireplace, and a few books of the Mangnallâ\\x80\\x99s Questions class leaned up against one another on their shelves in a manner which, under any roof less correct than Miss Back 172 boardâ\\x80\\x99s, would have suggested intoxication. An inclined planeâ\\x80\\x94torture-engine peculiar to femalesâ\\x80\\x94stood in one corner, and a pair of dumb-bells (probably the only ones in the house), in another. The apartment was, in short, devoted to the severer branches of the educational course, inclusive, as it subsequently appeared, of hair-cutting. Miss Backboard rang the bell. â\\x80\\x9c Elizabeth,â\\x80\\x9d observed she to the domestic, with the air of a stage-monarch ordering a banquet, â\\x80\\x9clet a cloth be spread, and inform those young ladies who require his services, that this personâ\\x80\\x94the young person from Mr. Tipsawayâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94is120 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, awaiting them in the Geographical Chamber. And, Elizabeth, tell Miss Crummy to come down first, because her dressing-gown is the largest, and will do for all the others.â\\x80\\x9d By the time Master Bichard had arranged the cloth upon the floor, and put on the kangaroo apron, the young lady in question made her appearance. A loose and voluminous pink robe concealed the form, which was also doubtless voluminous and pink ; but the sight of her chubby cheeks and good-humoured eyes ought to have satisfied anybody. â\\x80\\x9cI think you forgot your curtsey, Miss Crummy,â\\x80\\x9d observed the schoolmistress with marked severity. That young lady immediately rose from the cane- bottomed chair and made a profound obeisance. Master Kichard Smith, in imitation of the Chevalier de Crespigny, bowed almost to the ground. â\\x80\\x9c Be quiet, boy !â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated Miss Backboard sharply. â\\x80\\x9c Do you suppose my pupil bowed to you ?â\\x80\\x9d The school 172 mistress seated herself on the upper extremity of the inclined plane, and from that station superintended the operations. â\\x80\\x9cYou are looking out of window, Miss Crummy, which is forbidden ; be good enough to keep your eyes fixed on the ground.â\\x80\\x9d Miss Crummy did not reply; but Dick perceived the back of her neck to become of a deeper rose-colour, and her plump figure to shake as with secret laughter beneath his admiring eyes. â\\x80\\x9cYou are exposing your hand, Miss Crummy, in anTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 121 indelicate manner. Where are your mits, which I have particularly directed to he worn in the presence of strangers ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I thought, madam,â\\x80\\x9d replied the young lady, speak 172 ing in the French tongue, for the private ear of the schoolmistress, â\\x80\\x9c that you only meant we should do so in the presence of grown-up gentlemen, and that for this little boy here â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Silence, girl !â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the schoolmistress hastily, and in German : â\\x80\\x9c â\\x80\\x98the little boy here,â\\x80\\x99 as you call him, understands French.â\\x80\\x9d Miss Crummy bit her lips, and again Dick perceived an undulatory motion communicated to the entire dressing-gown beneath him. Before this young lady left the room, indeed, she had earned for herself a dozen rebukes, and one most barbarous punishmentâ\\x80\\x94a wooden mark was suspended from her ample neck, the presence of which ornament forbade any companion to communicate with her except in the German language, wherein she had shewn herself no great proficient in the Geographical Chamber. How long this was to be endured, Dick did not know ; but he was relieved to hear Miss Crummyâ\\x80\\x99s cheerful laugh as she ran upstairs, apparently with the lightest of hearts, though with a step that went nigh to shake the establishment. Angel after angel, sylph after sylph, came down and arrayed herself in the voluminous pink, under Dickâ\\x80\\x99s assiduous hands. He did not giggle, like Mr. Frizzle, he did not again even venture upon bowing, like M. de122 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, Crespigny. Miss Backboard began to be mollified by his perfect behaviour, and to entertain that trust in his methodical quietness which she had denied to his tender years ; she yawned while the fifteenth seraph was having her tips taken off, and inquired languidly whether there was any more to come. The seraph replied that there was only Miss.Mickleham to come, who had been delayed until last by reason of her being under punishment. â\\x80\\x9cVery well, then,â\\x80\\x9d replied Miss Backboard loftily; â\\x80\\x9c you may tell her that it is her turn when you have done.â\\x80\\x9d With which that imperial, female launched herself off her inclined plane with the air of a ship of ninety guns, and sailed majestically out of the room. â\\x80\\x9c Queer old lady that, is she not ?â\\x80\\x9d observed the fifteenth seraph interrogatively, about two minutes after the door had closed, and when it was made clear, by the creaking of the stairs, that her preceptress had really left the keyhole. Master Bichard Arbour, who had remarked the young lady under present treatment as being by far the best behaved and most rigid of all the heavenly bodies that had preceded her, was perfectly aghast at this familiarity. â\\x80\\x9c Look here,â\\x80\\x9d pursued she, producing a considerable bundle of letters stamped, sealed, and directed in readi 172 ness for her Majestyâ\\x80\\x99s mails, â\\x80\\x9cput these in your pocket, and make haste. I have been trying to make you take hold of them this five minutes, only youâ\\x80\\x99re such a stupid boy. I was within half a second of running a hair-pin into you, I do assure you.â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 123 Dick took the packet with an air of the profoundest astonishment. â\\x80\\x9cWell, and what am I to do with them, please, miss, now Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got â\\x80\\x99em?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhy, post â\\x80\\x99em,â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated the young lady snap 172 pishly. â\\x80\\x9c What on earth do you suppose ought to be done with them ? We always got Frizzle to post â\\x80\\x99em, before you came, and we expect, of course, that you will do as much for us. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s half-a-crown, and weâ\\x80\\x99re much obliged to you for your trouble.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Mademoiselle,â\\x80\\x9d replied Master Bichard Arbour, laying his hand and scissors on his heart, â\\x80\\x9c I will post the letters with pleasure ; but to take your money for doing it is a thing quite out of the question.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s polite at all events,â\\x80\\x9d replied the young lady, rising and approaching the glass. â\\x80\\x9cBut I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you cut my hair quite so well as the other. Why doesnâ\\x80\\x99t that stingy old lady let us have a couple of mirrors? One positively canâ\\x80\\x99t see how one looks. How do I look behind, boy ?â\\x80\\x9d The startled Dick hastened to give it as his opinion that she looked charming from every possible point of view ; whereupon the fifteenth seraph laughed, and said he was a nice lad. â\\x80\\x9cOnly,â\\x80\\x9d she added, â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t you go telling Miss Mickleham about those letters, mind, because sheâ\\x80\\x99s a little â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x96\\xa0â\\x80\\x94a pantomimic action of the hands, significant of staylacing here took placeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9ca little strait-laced, you know, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all. Good-bye, boy. Thank ye ! â\\x80\\x9d With which adieu the young lady opened the door, and called Miss Mickleham in much such a tone as one124 EICHAED ABBOTT; OK, female saint might evoke another to martyrdom : â\\x80\\x9c Miss Mickleham, the young person is waiting to cut your hair.â\\x80\\x9d Every male individual beneath a certain rank in the social scale was held in Miss Backboardâ\\x80\\x99s establish 172 ment to be a â\\x80\\x9c person,â\\x80\\x9d while all above and of that rank were spoken of (and even but that very rarely) as â\\x80\\x9c gentle 172 men.â\\x80\\x9d The word â\\x80\\x9c man â\\x80\\x9d was entirely ignored, and per 172 haps unknown at Acacia House. Most of the young ladies had hitherto floated into the apartment as though the air were water, and the little material substance that belonged to them had been made of cork ; hut Miss Mickleham used a somewhat graver mode of progress, either in consequence of being under punishment, or by reason of having a number of works upon Political Economy in her hands, that the author had the temerity to call â\\x80\\x9c popular,â\\x80\\x9d hut which, nevertheless, may have kept her down a little. That abstruse science oppressed her existence at Miss Back 172 boardâ\\x80\\x99s (who considered its study to he a part of womanâ\\x80\\x99s mission), just as Practice had oppressed poor Dick else 172 where, and he intuitively sympathised with her as she put down, by the side of the terrestrial globe, all the volumes, save one, with a great sigh. That one she was bound never to part with, eating or drinking, sleeping or hair-cutting, until she had mastered certain rather unentertaining chapters upon the - drain of gold ; and she sat down in the pink dressing-gown with it in her hand. Dickâ\\x80\\x99s tender heart would have been touched by sight of that young cheek robbed of half its bloom by sorrow, and by those long black eyelashes steeped inTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 125 tears, even had lie not detected by her likeness to her father the beautiful daughter of good Mr. Mickleham of Darkendim Street, at the first glance. As it was, the memory of the old manâ\\x80\\x99s kindness moved him so, awakening, as often happens, other memories with it of loving hearts now sundered from his own, perhaps for ever, that his eyes too began to fill with dew, which presently overflowing them, descended in a couple of large warm tears upon the young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s neck. The tresses that should have protected it were in Dickâ\\x80\\x99s trembling hands, so that they fell directly upon the velvet skin with certainty of detection, and the six 172 teenth seraph jumped up from her chair, and exchanged the drain of gold for a shrill note of indignation. â\\x80\\x9cHow dare you, sir?â\\x80\\x9d she began; then, looking at Dickâ\\x80\\x99s tearful face, she sank her voiceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c What ails you, my good boy? Is there anything I can do for you, poor lad?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Yes, dear young lady, yes.â\\x80\\x9d The dear young lady looked like a ruffled swan at this exordium. â\\x80\\x9c Tell your good father that Eichard Arbour is not un 172 grateful to him, though he may have seemed so, and that he could not look upon his daughter in her sorrow without being sad himself.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Are you Mr. Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s nephew, then, that ran away?â\\x80\\x9d cried she, â\\x80\\x9c Oh, pray go backâ\\x80\\x94pray do, while there is time. Your uncle is being more and more set against you than ever. Papa can do little for you, though he has tried his best; but perhaps, if you w T ould126 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, come back, he might do something. Do, pray, come at once to usâ\\x80\\x94that is to him. This is where we live.â\\x80\\x9d She tore the fly-leaf out of the book she held, which happened to have her name and direction on it, and Dick kissed it gratefully, and put it carefully away. â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I will, dear young lady; and if I am taken back, it shall at least be through your father. Forgive my rudeness and impertinenceâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHush!â\\x80\\x9d cried the girl; â\\x80\\x9cI hear Miss Backboard coming. I have nothing to forgive in youâ\\x80\\x94nothing !â\\x80\\x9d She snatched up her books from their resting-place, and was about to leave the room, when the voluminous dressing-gown, which she had forgotten to throw off, caught in the projecting leg of the terrestrial globe, and in another moment there was a frightful crash, and poor Miss Miekleham stood in horror amidst the wreck of the universe. â\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d cried the schoolmistress, rushing in, â\\x80\\x9cwhat has happened? You clumsy little barberâ\\x80\\x99s monkey you, what have you done ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI couldnâ\\x80\\x99t help it, maâ\\x80\\x99am,â\\x80\\x9d cried Dick, without an instantâ\\x80\\x99s hesitation ; â\\x80\\x9c my apron caught in it just as I was trying to look out Jerusalem. I had done with the young lady, maâ\\x80\\x99am, and always wishing to improve myself when opportunity offers, wasâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Silence, sir !â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Misa Backboard viciously. â\\x80\\x9cLeave the room, Miss Miekleham, without one word, if you pleaseâ\\x80\\x94without one syllable. You have done me an irreparable damage, boy, and you shall never come to this house again.â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 127 â\\x80\\x9cYou have got another glohe, maâ\\x80\\x99am, havenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick, pretending to whimper, hut secretly delighted with having saved Miss Mickleham from the wrath of her mistress. â\\x80\\x9cYes, you idiot,â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated Miss Backboard; â\\x80\\x9chut itâ\\x80\\x99s a celestial one. Do you suppose that these globes are duplicates? If Mr. Tipsaway doesnâ\\x80\\x99t punish you pretty severely, my lad, it will not he for want of a line from me, I do assure you.â\\x80\\x9d Dick was rather afraid of Miss Backboardâ\\x80\\x99s antici 172 pating the promised chastisement there and then, and made haste to get out of Acacia House as soon as he could ; and, indeed, she was not able to resist aiming a box at his ears as he passed her at the front-door, which he only eluded by great forethought and activity. As soon as the garden-gate clanged behind him, however, Dickâ\\x80\\x99s face became radiant with happiness ; and pulling out the address which Miss Mickleham had given to him, proceeded to enclose in it a considerable lock of soft brown hair, which he had covertly snipped from that young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s luxuriant tresses.128 EICHAED AEBOUE ; OE. CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH. MONSIEUE DE CEESPIGNY. The day after Dickâ\\x80\\x99s visit to Acacia House was one of great anxiety to him ; partly on account of the expected letter from Miss Backboard, denouncing his conduct towards the terrestrial globe, and partly by reason of the singular secret he had discovered concerning Count Gotsuchakoff, which he did not know whether he ought to disclose to his friend M. de Crespigny or not. He spoiled several excellent heads of hair that morning with his indecisive hands, and in one instance, clipped some portion of a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s ear off, with no better excuse for the misadventure than that his hair and his skin were really so very much of the same colour, that he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell which was which; a remark which did not by any means reconcile the Fresh-complexioned to his fate. In the afternoon, the foreign gentlemen began to arrive in their saloon in unusual numbers, and Dickâ\\x80\\x99s attendance was required there for the handing of coffee, which it was not their custom to take except when aTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 129 long sitting was anticipated. There was hut little speechi 172 fying, and what there was, was carried on in subdued tones, hut there was a considerable display of documents with figures on them, which the youth perceived were not statements of accounts, hut statistics of armed men. There was to be a rising somewhere, and that upon a very extensive scale, and Herr Singlerâ\\x80\\x99s brow was weigh 172 tier with purpose than usual, and the fire in Signor Castiglianoâ\\x80\\x99s eyes burned fierce and luridly. M. de Cres- pigny carried on a brisk correspondence with Count Gotsuchakoff, and a score of times the Eussian bent for 172 ward and held the slip of paper in the gas-flame until it was completely consumed. So deeply interested, indeed, were the whole company in the business on hand that afternoon, that even the presence of Dick was regarded with some little impatience, and the speakers would drop their voices and linger on their words, if he entered the room even for a moment, like men who have that to say which concerns no interloper. Imagine, therefore, the universal confusion, when Dick suddenly burst their door open with a tremendous bang, and rushed into the saloon pursued by the furious barber. Half-a-dozen, at least, started to their feet, and placed their hands in their breast-pockets, as though to draw forth some hidden weapon; two made for the door, and fastened it ; one threw up the window, as though about to trust himself to the chance of a twenty-foot fall ; while Count Gotsuchakoff, with naked dagger, rushed at the trembling lad as he embraced the knees of M. de Cres- pigny. That gentleman, however, interposed his arm130 EICHARD ARBOUR; OR, with a gesture the Russian could not pretend to misin 172 terpret ; and rolling up, map-like, the document which lay before him with particular carefulness and delibera 172 tion, requested Mr. Tipsaway to inform the company to what fortunate circumstance they were indebted for the honour of his unexpected visit. Mr. Tipsaway shook his fist at his apprentice very feebly, and with lips as pallid with fear as they had been a moment before with anger, expressed his contrition for the intrusion ; the foreign gents must needs pardon him, he was sure, when he told them that he had just received word that one of his best customers, Miss Backboard, of Acacia Houseâ\\x80\\x94well known to the first familiesâ\\x80\\x94had withdrawn her patronage, on account of the infamous conduct of the young reprobate now before them; his righteous indignation had led him to chastise the youth with a stick snatched hastily from among those on sale in his front shop, and the ungrateful boy, instead of kiss 172 ing the rod, had had the temerity, in escaping from it, to disturb the present company. â\\x80\\x9c Leave the room, sir,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed M. de Crespigny sternly ; â\\x80\\x9c we have nothing to do with your Mademoiselle Backboards, and the rest of it.â\\x80\\x9d Bichard clung to his protectorâ\\x80\\x99s knees appealingly. â\\x80\\x9c The boy may stay,â\\x80\\x9d added the Frenchman ; â\\x80\\x9c he understands nothing of what we say.â\\x80\\x9d There were several murmurs from those present, and the Russian wrote a few words rapidly down, and pushed the slip to M. de Crespigny â\\x80\\x9c I like the poor boy,â\\x80\\x9d replied he, â\\x80\\x9c and beg this favourTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 131 of you for him for my sake.â\\x80\\x9d To Gotsuchakoff, he wrote : â\\x80\\x9c Fear not ; I will answer for the boy myself.â\\x80\\x9d The business of the clay was therefore resumed, and sitting silent at the feet of De Crespigny, the astonished lad soon found himself in possession of the details of a projected insurrection, the importance of which was evident even to his uninstructed mind. The sitting did not break up till a late hour. M. de Crespigny had stayed behind the rest, to beg off his young favourite from his impending punishment, and was about to leave the room for that purpose, when Dick suddenly locked the door, and threw himself on his knees. â\\x80\\x9c I speak your language, M. de Crespigny, \\'and have heard every word, or nearly so, of what has been said to-niglit.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9c Unhappy boy,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the count, seizing his arm with a grasp of iron ; you know not what you have done, nor what penalty you have incurred. I tell you,â\\x80\\x9d hissed he between his teeth, and with an awful sternness in his usually mild eyesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c I tell you you have spoken your own death-doom !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I have heard you many times before,â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick in quiet unterrified tones, â\\x80\\x9c and I have never whispered of aught that has been said to anybody. You have been kind to me, sir, and I would not betray your friends for a kingdom.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Alas, boy, I do believe you ; but this matter does not rest with me ; does not affect me only, but thousands. I tell you, since you have heard so much you must needs die!â\\x80\\x9d132 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, Pallid, determined, grim as severest Fate, and yet with a melancholy in his features horn of pity and tender 172 ness, De Crespigny drew the boy from his knees, and held him at armâ\\x80\\x99s length. â\\x80\\x9c Will you go quietly with me, and he judged by fierce, inexorable, incredulous men, or shall I stab you here ? 0 lies, how bitter is your fruit ! 0 curiosity, how fatal is the pass to which thou hast brought this child ! Fool, fool ! why not at least have enjoyed thine own deceit without making me partaker of it? What besotted vanity could have consumed thee ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c0 sir, it was no foolish vanity, but gratitude. I have used my knowledge only for your good, for your safety and for that of those you love. I tell you of my 172 self, only to warn you against another far more dangerous than I. There is one who hears all your plots you do not dream of.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Who, boy ?â\\x80\\x94who ?â\\x80\\x9d cried De Crespigny in a hoarse whisper. â\\x80\\x9c Has this barber dared to turn traitor ? Are there spies without ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c No, sir ; there are spies within. Count Gotsuch- akoffâ\\x80\\x9d The boy involuntarily stopped, so awful was the expression of the Frenchmanâ\\x80\\x99s face as Dick pronounced this name ; it seemed to become sea-green with rage and hatred. â\\x80\\x9c Beware what you say, boy,â\\x80\\x9d murmured he with difficulty, so choked was his voice with passionâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c beware ; your words are bullets â\\x80\\x94 daggers. What of the Russian \\\\ What of the deaf and dumb ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c He is neither deaf nor dumb,â\\x80\\x9d returned RichardTHE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 133 solemnly ; â\\x80\\x9c I heard him speak not forty-eight hours ago. He never burns those slips on which you write !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c You lie, you lie, hoy ; I have seen him bum them with my own eyes !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Not so, sir ; he burns other slips instead. I saw him do so thrice this very evening. He keeps the real ones in his pocket-book. If he were searched this moment, you would find them there.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Great Heaven ! can this he trae ?â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed De Crespigny. â\\x80\\x9c The place, the very hour, he holds in our handwriting ; the money and arms he knows, to a franc, a musket. The menâ\\x80\\x940 Heaven, and the women, the poor helpless women that this monster has the power to make desolate. Give me the brandy, hoy. I canâ\\x80\\x99t believe it. For thirty years, a spy and playing- muteâ\\x80\\x94for thirty years ! Yet some such wretch we must have had amongst us. So many plans betrayed, so many schemes abortive! Once more, good youth, upon your sacred soul, is this the truth ? Answer as you would answer at the judgment-seat, did this man speak ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c He did ; so help me Heaven !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c M. de Crespigny filled another glass with brandy, and tossed it off ; then put his cloak on with delibera 172 tion, and passed out of the room. The front-shop was tenantless, but he delayed there to call the barber, and extract from him, not without difficulty, a promise that his apprentice should not be beaten. Then parting, with a polite good-night, and even an uncommon gaiety, the Frenchman left the house. The next day (Thursday), and the day after that,134 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, the foreign gentlemen frequented Mr. Tipsawayâ\\x80\\x99s as usual, with one single exception, and the confusion of tongues in the smoking-saloon was as great as ever. On the third day the barber inquired of Herr Singler what had become of Count Gotsuchakoff, to which the German answered that he did not know, and that his friends were getting exceedingly anxious about him. That same evening, as Mr. Tipsaway was picking out the plums of the Dispatch newspaper, and distributing them, as his custom was, on Saturday nights, to the household in general, he came upon this remarkable paragraph : â\\x80\\x9c Mysterious Murder.â\\x80\\x94Last night, as the policeman on duty was passing down Blank Street, Poplarâ\\x80\\x94a rather unfrequented part of that neighbourhoodâ\\x80\\x94he perceived some person crouching down behind a hoard 172 ing, as if for the purpose of concealment. Upon turning his bullâ\\x80\\x99s eye upon this object, he found it to be a dead body, and by the dress and complexion, apparently that of a foreigner. Being carried to the police station, and examined, there was found a small wound in the left breast, as if made with a stiletto or other sharp and narrow instrument, which it is the surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s opinion could not have been inflicted by the deceased himself. A valuable watch and some money were found upon his person, as well as a pocket-book with various entries in it in the Russian tongue. The body had the appear 172 ance of having lain in the position in which it was found for several days. At present, the affair is enve 172 loped in mystery, but the police are actively engaged in its elucidation.â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 135 â\\x80\\x9c Upon my word of honour,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mr. Tipsa- way slapping his thigh, â\\x80\\x9c Iâ\\x80\\x99m half inclined to believe that that must he our poor old dummy. At all events, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go to Poplar this very night, and set my mind at ease. Prizzleâ\\x80\\x94no, youâ\\x80\\x99re a fool, and will he all night about itâ\\x80\\x94Smith, you run out, and get me a cab this instant. Smith, donâ\\x80\\x99t you hear? Why, what the deuce is the matter with the boy ?â\\x80\\x94heâ\\x80\\x99s all of a quiver.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I donâ\\x80\\x99t wonder at it,â\\x80\\x9d interposed Mrs. Tipsaway, â\\x80\\x9c the heat of this room is something quite insupportable. If you will just leave him to himself, while I open the window, heâ\\x80\\x99ll be right in half a minute, and by the time you have put on your boots.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSmith, what do you know about this\\'?â\\x80\\x9d whispered the woman vehemently, as soon as they were left alone. â\\x80\\x9c There has been some foul-play with this Russian, boy, and you know something of it. I heard you talking to De Crespigny on Wednesday night ; ay, that I did. I told you what would come of trying to deceive Martha Tipsaway. I may save you, even yet, you wretched boy,â\\x80\\x9d continued the barberâ\\x80\\x99s wife, with a vagueness of patronage that curiosity, however powerful, could scarcely excuse ; â\\x80\\x9c only tell me all you know, from beginning toâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Will you get me that cab, Smith, or will you not ?â\\x80\\x9d roared Mr. Tipsaway, reappearing with his great-coat and comforter. â\\x80\\x9c What is the meaning of this conduct, sir ? Why are you always fainting; and my wife always engaged in loosening your neckerchief ?â\\x80\\x9d136 EICHAED aeboue; oe, Dick snatched up his cap, and rushed into the street without one word of reply. The clock hands in the front-shop were then together at the eleventh hour, and Mr. Tipsaway calculated that before that hour struck his vehicle would have arrived. â\\x80\\x9c I believe that that is the stupidest boy we ever had,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the barber peevishly, at the expiration of the first ten minutes. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t agree with you,â\\x80\\x9d replied his lady curtly, not lifting her eyes from the Housekeeperâ\\x80\\x99s Best Adviser, of which recondite volume, however, she had not mas 172 tered a single sentence ; â\\x80\\x9c you might thank your stars if you were only one-half as sharp, Mr. T.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Sharp or not,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Tipsaway, maddened by delayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c sharp or not, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll give him such a supper of black-thorn before he goes to bed this night as he will find rather indigestible, as sure asâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c As sure as you are a wise man, Mr. T.,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted his consort, â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x98there ; you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t finish your sentence better than that. And not being a wise man, why you wonâ\\x80\\x99t give it him ; simply because the lad is never coming back again to give you a chance.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Never coming back again !â\\x80\\x9d echoed Mr. Tipsaway, sinking into an arm-chair as though overwhelmed by this intelligence ; â\\x80\\x9c why, heâ\\x80\\x99s got two tortoise-shell combs in his pocket almost new. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve owed that boy a tanning these five weeksâ\\x80\\x94one day or anotherâ\\x80\\x94and put it off, and put it off, and put it off, through good nature, and because I thought it best to pay him for all at once, and now 0 lor, if I had lout known.â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 137 CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH. THE MYSTEKY OF ME. JONES. London by night! What a brilliant and animated vision to those who, knowing nought of its guilt and wretchedness, are whirled from comfortable homes to gorgeous theatres, and mark the ceaseless throng from their carriage windows as though it were itself but a scenic pageant ! What a world of gilded vice and gay excitement to those who seek it, purse in hand, and with heated faces carefully averted from its darker side ! What a wilderness of woe to those who, houseless and moneyless, pace wearily its splendid streets, without one of its million lights disclosing to them the features of a friend ! For such, no loneliness of desert, no solitariness of sailless sea, can afford so utter an isolation as that infinite ocean of unknown fellow-creatures. The heart of London throbs indeed, as has been said, but to the poor wanderer in its stony ways in a manner far other than human. Among a thousand faces there is not one that says unto him, â\\x80\\x9cI pity you;â\\x80\\x9d not one, â\\x80\\x9cWhat makes you look so wretched and so wan 1â\\x80\\x9d Pleasure is thereâ\\x80\\x94real pleasureâ\\x80\\x94with bright eyes and radiant G 2138 EICHAED AEBOUE ; OE, cheeks ; and a hideous and unreal Pleasure pursues him, with eyes that are spirit-lamps, with cheeks that are painted skin. Wealth is there, in profusion, in su 172 perfluity, made hideous by contrast with the abject Poverty that stoops to pick the orange-peel from the kennel. Prudence is there, with many a cardinal vir 172 tue, all with suspicious looks and buttoned pockets, and putting their confidence in Order only, who is there also, blue-coated, and with truncheon in hand. But as for Human Sympathy, for any sign of Common Brother 172 hood to be encountered in six miles of human counte 172 nances in London by nightâ\\x80\\x94you must apply to the relieving officer of the district, who undertakes the supply of those articles ; and be sure, 0 wanderer, that it is his district, and that you do not put off the appli 172 cation until after business hours ! Poor Dick ran on and on for several minutes, only intent upon setting as many streets as possible between himself and the too inquiring Mrs. Tipsaway, and accompanied the whole of that distance by the image of Count Gotsuchakoff, as he was found behind the hoarding in Poplar with the stiletto wound in his left breast. Something had prompted the boy to avoid M. de Crespigny, ever since that Wednesday night when he had revealed to him the treachery of his associate, and now he felt a sort of comfort in that he had done so ; it was something that he had not touched that hand, which Dick did not dare to finish the thought, but sped on the faster upon his\\' way, as though to leave it and the phantasm which dogged his side behind him.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 139 The further he ran, however, the more perceptible and hideous it grew, and it was not till he had entered one of those temples dedicated to the grosser Bacchus, and drank off a glass of gin, that he found out how largely exhaustion and weariness enter into the composition of the impalpable. One had spirit, in fact, drove out the other ; hut the new arrival was only too familiar with poor Dick by this time, and agreed with him perfectly well. Befreshed and strengthened, at least temporarily, the lad inquired of a policeman where he was, and receiving the requisite intelligence, accompanied with a gruff advice to take himself home, availed himself, so far as he was able, of that recommendation. He retraced his steps through the now fast emptying streetsâ\\x80\\x94for he had been hitherto running due eastâ\\x80\\x94towards Golden Square, a place he had not visited since his emancipation from china, many months ago, and standing in the silent roadway there, contemplated his former home. Ho such feelings thronged his bosom as are said to affect young gentlemen of property upon revisiting the paternal resi 172 dences from which they have been absent for a long vacation or so. There was no old and favourite dog to treat him with indifference as a stranger, orâ\\x80\\x94still more objectionablyâ\\x80\\x94to tear him where he stood. Neither could he have been compared to some prodigal about to piteously appeal for any husks that might chance to be going in his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s establishment, for he had no inten 172 tion of humbling himself before that relative. Still, as it was almost the only house in mighty London which contained any well-wisher of his, he did look up at it,140 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, and particularly at Mrs. Trimmingâ\\x80\\x99s window, with an interest that, at least, he did not entertain for the next door. It was a beautiful starlit night, and he perceived that the housekeeperâ\\x80\\x99s blind was down, and the gaslight in her chamber extinguished ; the good old lady was evidently gone to bedâ\\x80\\x94respectable white-sheeted bed, about which no dreams of houseless wanderers, with their last twopence spent in gin, were likely to mingle. If he threw up a pebble, it would probably only break the glass, and not her slumber, for Mrs. Trimming was that sort of lady who appreciates her supper and sleeps sound. Hush ! who is that who softly opens the next win 172 dow, his windowâ\\x80\\x94for Uncle Ingram and Adolphus both sleep on the other side of the houseâ\\x80\\x94and gazes forth upon the dreaming city and the quiet stars ? Their heavenly light slides down upon her golden hair, as though it had been watching for some such resting- place, and bathes in those tremulous eyes wherein stands the dew. It is Dickâ\\x80\\x99s angel watching over him, although she knows it not, and suggesting what is right by her mere presence. He will not become a vagabondâ\\x80\\x94thinks heâ\\x80\\x94but for the sweet sake of her will ask shelter, even at such an hour as that, of Mr. Mickleham. Her face is leaning on her fair round arms, and she is thinkingâ\\x80\\x94 perhaps of Dick himself. Why has he never written to her, according to his promise ? Why has he not written to his mother ? Sister Maggie is in her dinner-dress, and it is not a black one. Thank God for that ; at least then, his mother lives. But why are they two inTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 141 London ?â\\x80\\x94for he well knows that Maggie and she are not apartâ\\x80\\x94why in Golden Square among his enemies ? He longs to know all this ; and by a whisper of his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s name, a motion of his hands, a stepping into the full light from underneath the shadow of the railings, he might have known it all. But, alas ! the black sheep has his pride, his obstinacy, his egotism, as the white sheep has ; and Rascality can stand upon its own dig 172 nity as ridiculously (if it were not for the pity of it) as Respectability itself. As it was, Maggie even saw him crouching thereâ\\x80\\x94 some abject wretch lashed by the bitter night-wind, as she deemedâ\\x80\\x94and disappearing for an instant, she came forth again and stretching out her beautiful white arm and neck, cast out a shimmering something which clanged upon the stones close by him, and then the casement closed, and she retired : â\\x80\\x94her last good deed for that day being done. Dick took the half-crown, and kissing it, put it away in the same pocket that held his other treasuresâ\\x80\\x94the lock of hair and handwriting of Miss Micklehamâ\\x80\\x94and creeping off abashed, fled west 172 ward towards the home of the old clerk. The population to which the policemen had before seemed to bear such insignificant proportion were now, in their turn, outnumbered by the guardians of the night, whose sauntering and heavy tread could be dis 172 tinguished on the pavement â\\x80\\x94 so still the night had grownâ\\x80\\x94from the drunken stagger of the reveller, and the slithering footsteps of the wretched women who still haunted the corners of the streets. All sounds were142 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, magnified and repeated by the accommodating echoes. If an oath broke forth, it edified ears far distant from those to which it was specially addressed ; and if a laugh, it pierced with its shrill mockery unwilling hearers half a street away. Dick heard two verses of a bacchanalian song sung out before he met the solitary singer, who was walking quickly, too, as though he thought half-past one was time to be at home, if not in bed. â\\x80\\x9cWe canâ\\x80\\x99t eat any more, We canâ\\x80\\x99t eat any more, We canâ\\x80\\x99t eat any mo-o-or, But vie\\'11 have some more to drink. We wonâ\\x80\\x99t go home till morning, We wonâ\\x80\\x99t go home till morning, We wonâ\\x80\\x99t go home till morâ\\x80\\x94ning, And â\\x80\\x99perhaps not even then!\\' Dick uttered a cry of delight as the roysterer passed him, for it was no other than Mr. Jones. That gentle 172 man, on his part, was not less surprised at the rencontre, although when he was put in possession of the young gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s forlorn condition (without, however, the par 172 ticulars of it, and least of all, with the immediate cause of Dickâ\\x80\\x99s departure from the barberâ\\x80\\x99s), he was certainly less delighted. â\\x80\\x9c Well, you must come home with me of course for to-night, Dick ; but you must not expect a palace, my good sir. We are spacious when we do get there, but we are a precious long way up. If our apartments give you the idea of having been taken unfurnished, you must not be surprised, Master Bichard. We have preferred to waitTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 143 for the very best things that can be got, rather than to be supplied at once by upholstering mediocrity.â\\x80\\x9d While the young man,wrapped in his loose cloak,thus discoursed sardonically concerning the lodgings whither they were bound, Dick felt, in spite of himself, a shudder creeping over him, as he recognised in the speaker an unmistak 172 able likeness to the popular representations of no other than the Enemy of Mankind. Alas ! there was no doubt about it ; there were the high shoulders, the mocking eyes, the demoniacal smile that had haunted many a dream of his, and, for all he could see to the contrary, the elongated ears might be touching the roof of that hat, and the tail be wound like a rope around that body. It seemed only of a piece with Mr. Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s Satanic character, that he should appear pleased with the impression that he had evidently produced upon his young friend, and should give expression to a prolonged â\\x80\\x9cHa! ha!â\\x80\\x9d (of a demoniac character), which, beginning at the top of the Haymarket, seemed to die away in the neighbourhood of Apsley House. â\\x80\\x9c You seem tired and out of spirits, my poor Dick,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Jones, unlocking a street door ; â\\x80\\x9c but we are at home at last. If Queen Lucidora lias not retired to her imperial couch, we will make her give us supper.â\\x80\\x9d Up and still up they toiled, until they came to the fourth storey, which was composed of one enormous chamber, lit by a sky-light, and otherwise rather over 172 provided with windows, and of another very small apartment without any window at all. They entered the former without knocking, and a rather pretty young f144 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, woman, who had been sitting by the fire, came forward with a yawn to welcome Mr. Jones. Though she was not so very pretty, nor he, as has been said, so divinely beautiful, yet Dick, who gazed upon them unobserved by the lady, was instantaneously reminded, by their embrace, of the meeting of Cupid and Psyche. The latter, it is true, was in a yellow dressing-gown, and without her wreath and wings, and the former wore his hat more upon one side than became a deity of such a reputation as the god of Loveâ\\x80\\x94but there they were, nevertheless, as Dick had seen them pictured scores of times. â\\x80\\x9c Lucidora, I have brought a young gentleman, who wants some supper. Mr. Richard Arbour, let me intro 172 duce you to Mrs. Jones.â\\x80\\x9d The start which that young lady gave at this an 172 nouncement, before she bounded into the little room to reassume her gown, wiped out the Psyche from Dickâ\\x80\\x99s retina, and presented in her stead Diana surprised at her ablutions by Acteon ; Mr. Jones, too, only wanted the horns to be the counterpart of that ill-fated hunter. The lad sank feebly into a chair, quite worn out by fatigue and want of food, and not without a suspicion that his wits were leaving him. â\\x80\\x9c Here is beer, my lad, and here is bread and cheese,â\\x80\\x9d cried his host, producing those articles from a cupboard : â\\x80\\x9c they will put a little life into you while supper is get 172 ting ready. These herrings are only waiting to be cookedâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThose herrings are for to-morrow,â\\x80\\x9d observed Lucidora, reappearing from the inner room, in a somewhat moreTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 145 decorated style of dress. â\\x80\\x9c How could you bring the young gentleman here at this time in the morning ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Well, I could have brought him in a cab, if I had had the money, but as it was, he brought himself, although with difficulty. Heâ\\x80\\x99s tired to death, and must lodge here for the night at least.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Lodge where?â\\x80\\x9d inquired the young lady, with a not imperceptible toss of her raven ringlets. â\\x80\\x9c Eebecca the Jewess, as I live,â\\x80\\x9d thought Dick, â\\x80\\x9c when defying the Templar Brian de Bois Guilbert ! â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c In that corner yonder, and in Cleopatraâ\\x80\\x99s galley,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Jones sonorously, pointing to a something between a boat and a horse-hair sofa which stood at the extremity of the apartment. â\\x80\\x9c Pillowed on the leopard-skin of Bacchus, and covered with Hamletâ\\x80\\x99s cloak, and the robe of Cardinal Wolsey when a-dying, he will need not the bed of down, nor the mattress said to be of horse-hair, but which too commonly is stuffed with wool.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c How, donâ\\x80\\x99t go on so like a ranting play-actor,â\\x80\\x9d re 172 turned Lucidora peevishly ; â\\x80\\x9c donâ\\x80\\x99t you see that you quite frighten the lad. I wish, young gentleman, we had something better to offer you than cheese.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Give him rabbit, the rabbit of Wales,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Jones with dignity. â\\x80\\x9cI think I could even eat a piece of such an animal myself.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Toasted cheese, at two in the morning !â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the hostess ; â\\x80\\x9c why, you will both have the nightmare.â\\x80\\x9d And in Dickâ\\x80\\x99s case that prophecy was certainly ful 172 filled to the letter. HUÃ\\xadi RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, He woke up, in the galley, from a deadly combat with Mark Antony and the Prince of Darkness, to find his host and hostess at breakfast, and that it was half 172 past ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock on Sunday morning. So exhausted was he even after that long rest, that he did not feel equal to conversation, hut lay upon his extempore bed with half-shut eyes, taking lazy note of the apartment and its contents. The quantity of light in the room, intercepted only at the side windows by half-a-dozen very tall chimneys, together with the vast expanse of liouse-roofs seen from where he lay, gave him the notion of being in a glass box, placed upon the very top of London, and that it was lucky he had his clothes on,for that getting out of bed would* have otherwise been a public impropriety. There was a machine like an enormous magic lantern immediately opposite to him, from which depended a vast black curtain. The carpetless floor was strewed with theatrical dresses of all descriptions, and several roughly coloured scenes, as for a dramatic representation, were leaning against the walls. The chair upon which he had thrown his coat overnight he now perceived to be three wooden steps painted to represent the base of a statue ; and Mr. Jones himself was seated not upon a chair but upon a priestessâ\\x80\\x99s tripod. Nothing that he saw, in fact, appeared to be real or natural except the herrings, and those were disappearing from the scene with pantomimic velocity. â\\x80\\x9c I say, just you leave one for the boy,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Lucidora, as Mr. Jones evinced a disposition to attach the final fish. â\\x80\\x9c Since you mean him to stay here, youTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 147 must give him enough to eat, although itâ\\x80\\x99s my belief he will never pay for his keep.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Mrs. T.,â\\x80\\x9d responded the otherâ\\x80\\x94and â\\x80\\x9c Why does he call lier Mrs. T., I wonder ?â\\x80\\x9d thought the attentive Dick â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cyou Women know nothing whatever of business, except its mere decorationsâ\\x80\\x94its accessories ; you under 172 stand the flying buttresses and the capitals well enough, but the walls and the pillars must be left to the great architect Man. What did Sunstroke give you per head for fairies when you were Titania ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Just five shillings, and out of that I had to find the gauze and spangles.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Which we used afterwards, once or twice, upon other occasions,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the other drily. â\\x80\\x9c Well, if mere supers fetch a crown apiece, what do you think of Ganymede being carried off by the Eagle ? Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a bird stuffer in Holborn who will lend me one for two- and-six, which will be just the thing. What do you think of Hyacinth with a Dutch cheese in his hand playing at the Discus with Apollo, eh ? That young fellow would look uncommonly well upon a By the by,â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Jones, interrupting himself, and turn 172 ing a little pale, â\\x80\\x9c it is just within the bounds of possi 172 bility that he may not be a novelty in the market after all. Sunstroke is always on the look-out, I know.â\\x80\\x94 Dick, my boy ; Dick, I say, are you awake ? We want to know whether you have ever been on a slide.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c On a slide?â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated the boy, sitting up in the galley and rubbing his eyes. â\\x80\\x9c O yes, I have been on a slide many scores of times.â\\x80\\x9d148 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, â\\x80\\x9c The deuce you have,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Jones in a tone of disappointment ; â\\x80\\x9c and yet you havenâ\\x80\\x99t been in town a twelvemonth, eh? There you see, Lucidora, didnâ\\x80\\x99t I tell you how they would jump at such a model as that ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I have never been on a slide in town,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick with simplicity ; â\\x80\\x9c only in winter-time, at Messrs. Dot and Carriwunâ\\x80\\x99s, there was a pondâ\\x80\\x9d At this explanation, Lucidora went off into a con 172 vulsion of laughter, and performed an act of hysterical applause with her feet ; Mr. Jones,- forgetting he was on a tripod, and not on a chair with a back to it, fell back 172 wards in a fit of frantic delight, and brought his head into sharp contact with the floor ; while Dick threw off the tiger-skin railway-rug and the red and black cloaks which served for bed-clothes, and joined in the con 172 tagious laugh which he himself had raised. He was about to perform his toiletâ\\x80\\x94which consisted simply of putting on his coatâ\\x80\\x94when Mr. Jones pointed to an enormous and highly ornamental metal basin, and made signsâ\\x80\\x94being as yet choked with merrimentâ\\x80\\x94that he might, if he had a wish that way, therein wash his face and hands. Thankfully availing himself of this per 172 mission, the youth was about to plunge his ruddy countenance into the water for the second time, when he was arrested by a cry of admiration from his host. â\\x80\\x9c One moment, Dickâ\\x80\\x94-just stop as you are one moment. Look at him, Lucidoraâ\\x80\\x94do just look at him before he leaps into the flood. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember the young classical party who, having once beheld himself in theTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 149 liquid element, could never afterwards be persuaded to admire anybody else ? Heâ\\x80\\x99s Narcissus to the very life, is Dick, and a couple of guineas out of Sunstrokeâ\\x80\\x99s pocket, if lie is a shilling. Thatâ\\x80\\x99ll do, Dick : go it again, and never mind us.â\\x80\\x9d Dick did â\\x80\\x9c go itâ\\x80\\x9d again, as directed, but not altogether without â\\x80\\x9c minding.â\\x80\\x9d It was a considerable trial for a youth of his modest disposition to be stopped in his ablutions, and have the attention of a strange lady drawn to his shut eyes and dripping features. â\\x80\\x9c When youâ\\x80\\x99re washed, Dick, and had your break 172 fast, and if you have nothing else particular to do, I want you to put on a dress that will admirably become you, and to permit me to take your picture with that machine yonder.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c And what, in the name of wonder, is it ?â\\x80\\x9d cried Dick in an agony of curiosity ; â\\x80\\x9c and how is it that I seem to have seen you and Mrs. Jones in so many other places and doing so many things. Itâ\\x80\\x99s very foolish, I know, but somehow or other it strikes me that I was at your wedding.â\\x80\\x9d Upon this, Dickâ\\x80\\x99s host and hostess had another access of delirious joy, lasting several minutes, after which the former took down a couple of stereoscopic slides, and handed them to his young friend. â\\x80\\x9cYou have not only seen our wedding, Dickâ\\x80\\x94at least in many a shop-win 172 dowâ\\x80\\x94but the christening of our first and only baby. Whereâ\\x80\\x99s the baby, Lucidora? Why, the poor child is actually standing on its head in the waste-basket ! I performed the ceremony myself in full canonicals, which150 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, Shadrach would not let me have, by the by, under three- and six. We also do all the classical poses plastiques for Mr. Sunstroke. Nay, I have doneâ\\x80\\x94and a very diffi 172 cult job it wasâ\\x80\\x94the veiy Fiend himself, as you may have seen.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c In short,â\\x80\\x9d said Dick, at a loss what name to give to this unexampled calling, â\\x80\\x9cyou areâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Photographers,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Jones, pulling up his shirt-collarâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c yes, and we flatter ourselves at the head of the profession. We are models for a stereoscopic photographer, and you shall join us, and become a model too.â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 151 CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH. A MODEL TO BE AVOIDED. After breakfast, Lucidora was despatched to Mr. Sun 172 stroke, to acquaint him of the treasure that awaited his inspection at his photographic roomsâ\\x80\\x94for the apart 172 ments occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Jones were his, and had been fitted up, as we have seen, with an eye to art purposes rather than to domestic convenience. Better, however, is any unfurnished residence, gratis, than the most stately dwelling-place and rent therewith ; and the two models lived cheaply and contentedly in their glass 172 houseâ\\x80\\x94throwing no stones at others, we will hopeâ\\x80\\x94and were even enabled to accommodate a young friend in addition, as we have seen. Their home and their place of business were thus conveniently amalgamated. From sunset until after breakfast, all was domesticity and private life ; but in the daytime, the nuptial- chamber was devoted to collodion and the black art, and the larger room became a theatre for tableaux. Those out-door picnics, so redolent of the leafy summer-time, with which the stereoscope has made us so familiar, all had their origin in that art-attic over the152 RICHAED ARBOUE; OR, Haymarket. There, couched at ease upon green baize, and under the shade of canvas woods, those July revellers held their pasteboard feasts, no matter what the weather or the season. There, too, was temporarily reared the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault of that well-known cathedralâ\\x80\\x94which has drawn many a tear from the impressionable medieval eye, stereoscopically deceivedâ\\x80\\x94wherein those white-robed choristers (at one- and-six) are swinging censers, with bowed head, before their bishop. And there, above all, those classical statues, with which we are so well acquainted, more lifelike than the greatest triumphs of Grecian art, reversed the miracle of Pygmalion, and turned from flesh and blood to marble. In such a very slight flesh-coloured garment, that the wearer felt excessively alarmed lest Mrs. Jones should re-enter the apartment before he changed it, the compliant Dick was now regarding himself in the big basin. Around his brow was a wreath of water- lilies made of green and white cotton, which bobbed about his face, and tickled him, like a night-cap with a too luxuriant crop of tassels. A piece of blue calico was looped about him, much as a window-curtain is festooned to right or left ; while into his countenance was thrown as vivid an expression of self-admiration as his sense of the lowness of the temperature and the falseness of his own position would permit the lad to assume. â\\x80\\x9cA little more forward, if you please, Narcissus,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Jones, who was in charge of the camera :THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 153 â\\x80\\x9cnot so much as that, though; thank you. Donâ\\x80\\x99t laugh, whatever you do, or youâ\\x80\\x99ll he a dreadful object. Good Heavens ! what are you scratching your ear for ? Pooh, pooh, a model must never itch! Couldnâ\\x80\\x99t you stand on one leg for a little, in order to give a lightness to the attitude ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNot without tumbling into the basin,â\\x80\\x9d rejoined Dick ; â\\x80\\x9cI couldnâ\\x80\\x99t indeed.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ah, well, we will try that afterwards, then ; it will not look ill as a specimen of an instantaneous I say, you mustnâ\\x80\\x99t wink your eyes, Narcissus ; you must stare steadily and fondly upon the water, please Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not a bad notion, though, I was going to say, for Sappho throwing herself off the Lesbian rock into the sea. Mrs. T.â\\x80\\x94Mrs. Jones I meanâ\\x80\\x94shall be Sappho, only it will spoil her clothes a good deal, unless she does it in a bathing-gown ; and you shall be Phaon. Now, you must not move a hairsbreadth, Dick, for the photograph is just going to be taken ; but donâ\\x80\\x99t hold your breath so much, or you will be purple, and there is no knowing what queer colour that may turn to in the photograph. In a couple of minutes, Narcissus the original was permitted to re-assume his less classical garments, and Narcissus the copy was lying in the dark chamber, steeped in an offensive preparation. â\\x80\\x9cYou did it capitally,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Jones with triumph ; â\\x80\\x9c and now it only remains to name your reward. Shall it be beer and tobacco, or shall we go to the Zoological Gardens ?â\\x80\\x9d154 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, â\\x80\\x9c Neither, thank you,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick, â\\x80\\x9cjust now. I should prefer, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t mindâ\\x80\\x94although you have forborne to inquire into my own recent historyâ\\x80\\x94to learn why it is you sometimes call Mrs. Jones, Mrs. T.?â\\x80\\x9d For a moment the photographee looked a little annoyed, hut immediately recovering his good-humour, observed : â\\x80\\x9c With all my heart, lad, for you are sure to know it some day, sooner or later. Come and sit down by the fire, and listen to the history of one who has been neglected by his age ; and draw the corks of that couple of bottles before we begin, Dick, for I hate to be interrupted by noise. When I went about the country with a couple of big candles and a Shakspeare, giving that admirable course of readings from the immortal bard, of which it was justly remarked by the Landâ\\x80\\x99s End Thunderer But there, I daresay, you never heard of them. Well, when I went about elevat 172 ing the masses by the lever of Dramatic Elocution, I always began the entertainment by a dissertation against noise.â\\x80\\x9d By this time the beer was drawn and emptied into a huge â\\x80\\x9c pewter,â\\x80\\x9d into which the Classical Model, having dipped his features, and emerged from the foam thereof after the manner of Cytlierean Venus, commenced as follows :â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9c If Lockeâ\\x80\\x99s theory he untenable, and one baby he really brought into the world with instincts and charac 172 teristics differing from those of another baby, it is certain that the individual who now addresses you, was born aTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 155 gentleman. I was a precious high chap in my notions from my very cradle, and I shall always he a precious high chap until I die. It was therefore monstrously inconsistent of Nature, having thus endowed me with qualities only befitting an exalted station, to permit my father to he the proprietor of an inconsiderable eating-house in Whitechapel ; and whatever griefs I have since come toâ\\x80\\x94and they have been numerousâ\\x80\\x94I have attributed, and, I think, with justice, to Nature only. It may be easily imagined that my poor parent â\\x80\\x94a good enough man in his line, which was, however, mainly confined to mutton-pies and sheepâ\\x80\\x99s trotters, with a sprinkling of a singular viand denominated Chitter 172 lings, the origin and nature of which are shrouded in mysteryâ\\x80\\x94was quite unable to appreciate the boon which liad been conferred upon him in an offspring such as myself. But my motherâ\\x80\\x94ah, my mother ! [here Mr. Jones appeared to be overcome with emotion, and once more buried his face for an extraordinary length of time in the pewter] that old lady was a regular trump, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s all about it.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ah,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Dick in a sympathetic voice, â\\x80\\x9c thatâ\\x80\\x99s just like my mother.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Well, I cut away from the tripe business, and my mother brought me back again, and then I cut away again. Then I went to school, and cut away from that. Then I was bound apprentice to a sign-painterâ\\x80\\x94for I had always a yearning towards the Fine Artsâ\\x80\\x94and I cut away from him. And at last, when I had made trial, in short, of most things that a lad might try on156 RICHAKD ARBOUR; OR, terra firma, I cut away from that, and went to sea. My connections, generally, were of a narrow order of mind, and didnâ\\x80\\x99t appreciate me. When I was quite young, they only shook their heads, and remarked, that, â\\x80\\x9c after all, I was nobodyâ\\x80\\x99s enemy hut my own.â\\x80\\x9d But when I grew older, and wanted a little money from them now and then to start afresh, then I became their enemy, and they shut their doors against me coincidently with their pockets. When I returned home to Whitechapel from my first voyage, my father was very far from killing a fatted calf in honour of that event : if it hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been for my mother, in fact, I should have had nothing for supper that night except cold chitterlings. He even expressed himself as owing Nature a grudge for having presented him with such a son, whereas, as I have demonstrated, the grievance lay precisely the other w T ay; while, in conclusion, he gave it as his opinion that I was nothing less than a â\\x80\\x9cblack sheepâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94his very metaphors, you per 172 ceive, being drawn from those shambles whence he pro 172 cured the raw material for the carrying on of his ignoble profession. In England, said lie, there was no pasturage, he thanked Heaven, proper for cattle of that sort, but there was a portion of the globe recently discovered, especially adapted, and as it seemed to some, provi 172 dentially designed, for the accommodation and sustenance of Black Sheepâ\\x80\\x94namely, Australia. If I was content to be exported thither, he would pay my passage : If I was not There was a certain choleric vulgarity, in short, about my respectable parentâ\\x80\\x94attributable, in some degree, as I haye always endeavoured to hope, toTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 157 his over-attachment to pigsâ\\x80\\x99 puddingsâ\\x80\\x94that led him into language which, from respect to his memory, I will not repeat. Wishing, however, to act a dutiful part, and being also entirely unprovided with the means for carrying on a domestic war, I acceded to the parental terms. I embarked for the Antipodes, and was accompanied on hoard the Betsey Jane by my father himself, impelled to that step by ardent affection, doubtless, and the desire of bidding me farewell, but also by the lingering suspicion that I might otherwise spend my passage-money more agreeably than in maritime travel. The ship was but a small one for so long a voyage, and not well officered ; the watches, particularly at night, being very ill kept. My berth was so small, that when we reached the Tropics it grew unbearable, and when it was fair, I used to lie on deck instead of below, with only the stars above me. One particularly still and solemn night, when I chanced to take up my quarters close beside the steers 172 man, I felt as disinclined for sleep as for exertion. I lay in a torpid state with my eyes open, but with my senses partially shut, and with my thoughts occupied indeed, yet not under my control, but wandering at their own wondrous will in the past and in the future, to the annihilation of time and space. The only sounds that broke the universal silence which reigned over sky and sea, were the turning of the wheel beside me, and the .clanking of the rudder-chains, at first at irregular inter 172 vals, and with more or less of violence, but presently158 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, becoming quite monotonous ; for the helmsman had fallen asleep, and left that indifferent vessel, the Betsey Jane, entirely to her own devices. Then the heavens grew cloudy, and the stars dimmer and dimmer, and the wind began to rise ; and still I lay with my face skyward, conscious but unconcerned. All of a sudden, there loomed something monstrous far above my face, shutting out the clouds from my sight, and I heard a noise other than that of the rippling of the waves about our sternâ\\x80\\x94it was the sound which the cut-water of a vessel makes in a freshening breeze. In half a second, I became fully conscious that the bow 172 sprit of some huge ship was passing over us, and that in another half-second the Betsey Jane would be run down with all lier crew complete. Casting my cloak from off me, I \\' leaped at the rigging which hung about the mighty beam, and thereby managed to climb up on it, and thence, with cautious trepidation, like a cat in wal 172 nut shells upon the ice, on to the forecastle of the stranger. When I had reached so far, the Betsey Jane was not to be seen. She had not been run down, for I had not felt the slightest shock, but had escaped by the skin of her teeth, and with the loss of one of her most respectable passengers. I was not at all surprised, after what had happened, to find the look-out man of the stranger also asleep at his post ; but it did disgust me, when I woke him for the purpose of explaining the circumstances, to see him throw up his arms with a great shriek, and run below, exclaiming that the devil was on the forecastle ; though,THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 159 if the thing had happened in these stereoscopic days, there might have been some foundation for the libel. As it chanced, I had got on board an Australian vessel bound for the London Docks, where I presently arrived, after a six monthsâ\\x80\\x99 sea-voyage almost unprecedented in the barrenness of its results. My reception in Whitechapel, as may be easily imagined, was not enthusiastic ; but, on the other hand, I arrived just in time to receive the bequest of the travelling wild-beast show from my maternal uncle ; it goes about the country under my name until this day, but as you are aware, I did not long remain its proprietor. The position was not, perhaps, of a suffi 172 ciently gentlemanlike character to suit my aspiring nature. You would have liked it, would you, Dick? Perhaps so ; I have often regretted, myself, that I should have been born so precious high. The very same thing occurred when I subsequently took up the dog-trade. A puppyâ\\x80\\x99s tail, Dick, take my word for it, is not a mouthful for a gentleman ; and yet, unless they are bitten off, â\\x80\\x9cthe Fancyâ\\x80\\x9d will not have them at any price. I daresay I had eaten many a one in my respected papaâ\\x80\\x99s pies ; but then the cooking makes such a deal of difference. That good man died at the very period when I failed in dogsâ\\x80\\x94a circumstance which redounds to his credit as a man and a fatherâ\\x80\\x94and paid the debt of nature just in time to enable me to settle with my creditors. My poor mother was not left quite so well provided for as might have been expectedâ\\x80\\x94for my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s will, it seems, had always been in my favour,1G0 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, although his way had sometimes been so unpleasantâ\\x80\\x94 and she therefore very wisely determined to take a situation asâ\\x80\\x94asâ\\x80\\x94as housekeeper in a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s family ; and I am hound to say that she has been of considerable use to me while in that position.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIs it Mrs. Trimming?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dick with some hesitation. â\\x80\\x9cThat is the very party,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Jones, â\\x80\\x9cand a very nice old party she is. It was thought that your respected uncle might have a prejudice about her being the mother of such a What shall I say ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSuch a precious high chap,â\\x80\\x9d suggested Dick with gravity. â\\x80\\x9cJust so,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Jones; â\\x80\\x9cand therefore we have kept the connection dark, as far as he is concerned.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd Mrs. Jones being your wife, that is why you call her Mrs. T.,â\\x80\\x9d observed Dick. â\\x80\\x9c Well, the fact is, she is, and she isnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d returned the photographee, revisiting the tankard. My mother donâ\\x80\\x99t know about it, you see ; she has her prejudicesâ\\x80\\x94I find so many people have about so many thingsâ\\x80\\x94and so I keep that dark too. But, hark ! I hear Lucidoraâ\\x80\\x99s footsteps upon the stairs, and, if I mistake not, that of our proprietor also.â\\x80\\x9d As he finished speaking, Mrs. Jones entered the room, accompanied by Mr. Sunstroke, a little old man with an immense pair of gray moustaches. He was always stroking and petting these, as though to keep them in good-humour, and dissuade them from flying away with himâ\\x80\\x94a proceeding for which they lookedTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 161 admirably adaptedâ\\x80\\x94and he stood now in the doorway with one of them in each hand, and with his head very much on one side, regarding Dick with his keen, critical eyes, as though the lad were some object of vertÃ\\xad, of which he had been offered the first refusal. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t like that little mole 011 his left cheek,â\\x80\\x9d observed the photographer, after a prolonged investiga 172 tion. â\\x80\\x9cAh, thatâ\\x80\\x99s where 1 differ from you !â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Jones with coolness. â\\x80\\x9c Without that mole, he would be commonplace enough, perhaps ; but with itâ\\x80\\x94being as it is, a beauty rather than a blemish, tooâ\\x80\\x94he becomes unique at once.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Yes,â\\x80\\x9d replied the artist drily, â\\x80\\x9c so unique that every 172 body must needs know him again, and he will only serve us for one pose. The public canâ\\x80\\x99t be expected to believe that Hyacinth, Ganymede, Narcissus, \\'and the whole army of mythological youth, were all distin 172 guished by a mole upon their left cheeks, you know ; itâ\\x80\\x99s quite ridiculous.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Suppose,â\\x80\\x9d suggested Mr. Jones sardonically, â\\x80\\x9c that you sometimes took his right profile instead of his left.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s something in thatâ\\x80\\x9d assented the little artist candidly ; â\\x80\\x9c and the young fellow is not altogether without expression, I must confess.â\\x80\\x9d Dick, indeed, was looking volumes of astonishment, as well .he might, while this question of his personal valuation was heing settled, and felt much relieved when the bargain was concluded, and he found himself pledged to give some half-a-dozen â\\x80\\x9csittingsâ\\x80\\x9d to Mr. h 2162 RICHARD arbour; or, Sunstrokeâ\\x80\\x94although he never sat except in that cele 172 brated pose of the â\\x80\\x9c Boy Extracting a Thornâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94at thirty shillings for the single figure, and a pound for one of a group ; one half of which remuneration was to go to Mr. Jones, in return for food and lodgment. â\\x80\\x9c Well,â\\x80\\x9d observed the artist, when these terms had been finally arranged, â\\x80\\x9cI should have come up here this morning at all events, independently of our classical young friend. I have gone into a new line since I was with you yesterday morning. The stereoscopic business is extending, my friendsâ\\x80\\x94is ramifying. You remember that prison-tour of ours, Trimming, last\\' summer, wherein we photographed about five hundred as ill-looking scoundrels as the sun ever shone upon, in order that justice might keep mementos of their visitâ\\x80\\x94duplicates of their expressive physiognomies. Well, I was sent for, special, by the police, last afternoon, to do another job for them. It has been determined, it seems, in the case of all unclaimed â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 However, just look at that ; it speaks for itself, donâ\\x80\\x99t it ?â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sunstroke drew a slide out of his pocket, placed it in a stereoscope, and handed it to Mr. Jones for inspection ; then stroking his moustaches with great vehemence, as if to make up for his neglect of them while arranging the instrument, he awaited the verdict of his photographee. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the most lifelike, at least deathlike thing,â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Jones, â\\x80\\x9cI ever But here, Dick, what do you say about it ; your opinion, as that of an outsider, should be better worth having? Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that a splendidTH}5 FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 163 specimen of what art can do towards strengthening the hands of justice \\\\ A score of years after that mortal body has dropped to pieces, the lineaments of the dead manâ\\x80\\x99s features will remain as you see them now, to be recognised by anyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Gotsuchakoff !â\\x80\\x9d cried the lad with a shriek of terror, casting the instrument upon the ground, and cowering into a corner of the wall, as if he had been struck. Mr. Sunstroke bounded forward, but too late to save the already shattered slide ; Lucidora rushed into the little chamber for a jug of water to throw over the faint 172 ing boy ; but Mr. Jones seized possession of the camera, and bidding everybody keep away from the lad upon their lives, proceeded to take an instantaneous photo 172 graph of himâ\\x80\\x94which afterwards became one of the most popular of the â\\x80\\x9c ghost-slides,â\\x80\\x9d under the very taking title of The Spectre-smittenâ\\x80\\x94a Study !164 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, CHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH. IN TROUBLE. Having thus involuntarily commenced liis profession â\\x80\\x94having achieved his first stereoscopic success in a manner at least as accidental as that by which the artist in the story painted his cloudâ\\x80\\x94namely, by throw 172 ing his brush at itâ\\x80\\x94Dick pursued it with assiduity and pleasure. It was not very hard work, even while it was going on, and wet days and dark days were holidays in the photographical calendar ; moreover, it was rather pleasant to recognise himself in shop-windows, and hear the criticisms passed by the vulgar upon his classi 172 cal attitudes. Mr. Sunstrokeâ\\x80\\x99s manner was kind, and his anecdotes amusing enough, whenever at least, there was anything like a good light. Mr. Jones was always chatty and agreeable ; and Lucidora, although she suffered occasionally from depression of spirits, imparted that feminine flavour to the general conversation without which the society of the greatest wits is said to be im 172 perfect. She evidently liked the youth, and her mani 172 festation of that feeling produced at once its effect on Dick, whose heart was indeed a very mirror for reflectingTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 165 the least good-will that happened to he shewn to it ; but Mr. Jones monopolised most of the talk when Mr. Sun 172 stroke was not with them, and studiously confined it to the airiest themes, so that the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s disposition and character remained almost as unknown to Dick as on the night when he had first seen her. He never chanced to be left alone with herâ\\x80\\x94Mr. Jones declaring that he was jealous of Narcissusâ\\x80\\x94until a certain morn 172 ing some weeks after his arrival, when the photographee had gone out for some twenty minutes to his costumier Shadrach, to hire that very hussar uniform in which w r e have so often seen him proposing to the young lady in the conservatory. â\\x80\\x9cRichard Arbour,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed she, the instant that the street-door was shut, and without the least hesitation or introduction â\\x80\\x9c would you like to see your mother once more before she dies % â\\x80\\x9d Dick, who, very much in dishabille, was fitting a gilded wing on to a flesh-coloured shoulder-strap, uttered such an inarticulate cry of grief and terror, that the womanâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, which had looked hard and harsh enough when she first spoke, grew tender at once. â\\x80\\x9c Hush,â\\x80\\x9d she went on, â\\x80\\x9c it is not your fault, or at least not all your fault. They have kept that from you which they should have told. Mr. Sunstroke does not want to lose you, be 172 cause 0 Dick, we are all of us very selfish, and need much forgiveness % â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c What of my mother ? â\\x80\\x9d whispered the lad, as though he heard lier not. â\\x80\\x9c What of my dear mother ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c She is illâ\\x80\\x94very ill,â\\x80\\x9d returned the other. â\\x80\\x9c I am166 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, sure of that by what I heard last night. Eichard was told so by Mrs. Trimming. She is in Golden Square, not ten minutesâ\\x80\\x99 run from this, Dick. To-morrow, Eter 172 nity itself may he between you. I have known what it is to miss a motherâ\\x80\\x99s blessing ; I pray you may never know it, too, and that is why I speak.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I will tell her,â\\x80\\x9d sobbed Dick, as he thrust on his shoes and coatâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c I will tell her how you saved me from that loss.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Tell her nothing about me!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the girl with passionate shrillness. â\\x80\\x9c Forget me and all that belongs to me when you leave this room. Let not the thought of her be ever mixed up with thought of me, unless you would defile your motherâ\\x80\\x99s memory!â\\x80\\x9d Hurried and panic-struck as the hoy was through the news he had just heard, he ran up to the wretched woman as she poured forth her bitter words, and lifted up his face that she might kiss him. But she turned away, and put him aside with her hand, crying that her Bps were poison ; and again bade him depart while there should yet be time. Dick needed no third warning, but fled down the stairs and into the street Eke one distracted. Fast as he flew, however, through the wondering crowds, and short as was the distance he had to traverse, the thoughts of what he had done, and wdiat he had left undone, in re 172 gard to his beloved mother, passed through his conscience- stricken mind again and again. He had written to her but three times during the fifteen months or so that had elapsed since his departure from his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s, givingTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 167 indeed a cheerful view of his mode of life, but without specifying what it was, or mentioning any address whereby she might write to him, as he well knew she must have lovingly longed to do. Cognisant of her thraldom to Sister Maria, he had not ventured to disclose his whereabouts, for fear of its being revealed to Uncle Ingram, while his boyish pride revolted at the idea of confessing the actual nature of the humble pursuits in which he had been engaged. The sense of this unfeeling conduct, unmitigated now by any such excuses, possessed him wholly, and left no room for any dread of repulse or humiliation that he might meet with at the hands of his uncle or Adolphus. He only yearned to penitently cast himself at the feet of her whose loving heart was breakingâ\\x80\\x94perhaps brokenâ\\x80\\x94for his sake ; for his, to whom a strangerâ\\x80\\x94and, by her own account, a far from ex 172 emplary character herselfâ\\x80\\x94had had to point out the cruelty of his silence, and to remind him of that parent who ought never to have been absent from his thoughts. What was drudgery in the china warehouse, or cold looks and cutting words from those who loved him not, that to escape them he should have added so heavily to that burden of sorrow which he well knew his mother had to bear? Had she ever shrunk from a personal sacrifice by which the merest pleasure was to be conferred upon him 172 self? â\\x80\\x9cWicked, wicked boy though I have been,â\\x80\\x9d thought he, â\\x80\\x9c henceforth, at all events, mother, you shall never have cause to complain of the conduct of your son!â\\x80\\x9d Alas! how unfortunate is it that these inward deter-168 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, minations to lead a new lifeâ\\x80\\x94these little private Improve 172 ment bills which are passed in the Parliament of our own heartsâ\\x80\\x94can never be made sufficiently public ; and what is of greater importance, be got to be publicly believed ! that we cannot cry, â\\x80\\x9c Let bygones be bygones,â\\x80\\x9d and so become quits for what has passed, with all the world ! â\\x80\\x9c My behaviour, up to this time,â\\x80\\x9d so our con 172 fession runs, â\\x80\\x9chas been, I must confess, abominable, and nothing less ; but henceforward, 0 my fellow-creatures, I start upon a new tack and under an honest flag. I have got out of the Smuggling cyclone, and mean to be driven for the future by no other winds than \\'most straightfor 172 ward ones. You and I, 0 Eevenue Cutter, called Society, have been hitherto at cross-purposes, but let us mutually salute. I feel already, in anticipation, the delights that will flow from a due obedience to the Excise laws.â\\x80\\x9d But alas ! the Society ranges up with her guns double-shotted ; can be got to credit nothing of what is intended for the future ; harps solely upon some past â\\x80\\x9c Tubs,â\\x80\\x9d illegally run by us, the deuce knows when, and takes us into harbour a condemned vessel, just as we were upon the point of commencing a career of universal usefulness. Poor Dick was as full of pious resolves, as dead to any old temptations, when he turned the corner of the street leading into Golden Square, as any lad of his years could be in all London, when, lo and behold ! a hand is laid upon his collar, and a voice, as firm and quiet as that of conscience itself, remarks Weâ\\x80\\x99ve got you at last, young gentleman ; though we have been looking after you a plaguy long time!â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 169 Thus spoke that efficient officer A1 of the metropolitan police force, taking the steadiest gripe of the ladâ\\x80\\x99s coat- collar, hut managing, nevertheless, to convey no other idea to casual passengers, but that Dick and he were engaged in familiar conversation; â\\x80\\x9c Now, I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to throttle you, young sir, nor nothing like it, so I do hope you have made up your mind to come along without a row.â\\x80\\x9d Poor Dick had certainly just been making up his mind to obey all constituted authorities, hut the practical compliance thus immediately expected of him was rather embarrassing too. â\\x80\\x9c Why, you must have knowed,â\\x80\\x9d continued Al, in answer to his astonished look, â\\x80\\x9c that this here was the very place of all places as you should never have come to. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s one of us in every street out of that square yonder with his orders about you. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s been a de 172 tective a-lolling against your area-gates for the last fortnight. Why, lawk-a-mercy ! to see you a-coming here in the broad daylight, as though there was nothing out against you, and no reward for your being took up â\\x80\\x94why, it do beat lettuces for greenness ; and you a conspirator too ! â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c A conspirator !â\\x80\\x9d echoed the wondering lad. â\\x80\\x9c I do nâ\\x80\\x99t know what you mean indeed ; but I do pray that you will let me see my mother first, before you take me away.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c 0 lor ! 0 my ! I canâ\\x80\\x99t stand this,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the policeman, taking out a pair of handcuffs from his pocket. â\\x80\\x9cYou must he a slippery chap to talk like that. For a young murderer and a foreign plotter to he so170 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, precious innocent and devotedly attached to his parent, is something too much.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c0 donâ\\x80\\x99t, for Godâ\\x80\\x99s sake, donâ\\x80\\x99t !â\\x80\\x9d cried the agonized boy. â\\x80\\x9cI have done nothing to deserve to wear those things, indeed. I had nothing to do with itâ\\x80\\x94if itâ\\x80\\x99s about Count Gotsuchakoffâ\\x80\\x94except that I told upon him to Mr. De Crespigny to save the others.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Crepinny was his name, was it?â\\x80\\x9d repeated the policeman. â\\x80\\x9cVery good, sir. Now, here is a vehicle which will take us to Poplar quite comfortably, and without the necessity of my putting on the bracelets.â\\x80\\x9d The policeman beckoned to a passing cab, and the two got into it. As soon as they were inside A1 re 172 laxed his gripe of the lad, who was weeping bitterly, and bade him be of good cheer, for that it was very unlikely that they would do more than lag such a young â\\x80\\x99un as he. - ; â\\x80\\x9c Might I see the house, please ?â\\x80\\x9d cried Dick eagerly, as he perceived this change for the better in his captorâ\\x80\\x99s feelings. â\\x80\\x9c Might we drive slowly past, that I at least may see the house in which she is ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Mr. Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s, I suppose, you mean, my lad. Well, I daresay you may. Take the right hand of the square for Poplar, cabman. Here it is, then, and there isnâ\\x80\\x99t much to look at, as I can see. The familyâ\\x80\\x99s all gone out of town since yesterday, I reckon. Itâ\\x80\\x99s all shut up, with the blinds down, and the rest of it, just as though somebody had been and gone and died Hullo ! young fellow, keep up, will you ?â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated the police 172 man, as the boy fell heavily forward, and sunk down aTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 171 lifeless heap upon the floor of the cab. â\\x80\\x9c Well, I thought he was too young to carry it through so precious cool as he began it. Drive as fast as you can, will you, cabby ? for your fare here has been and fainted slap bang off.â\\x80\\x9d172 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, CHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH. THE WITNESSES. When Richard Arbour â\\x80\\x9c came to himself,â\\x80\\x9d as the phrase is, he also came to a series of policemen, beginning with Al, an inspector, three reporters, two magistratesâ\\x80\\x99 clerks, and one magistrate, not to mention a considerable num 172 ber of the general publicâ\\x80\\x94the last of whom were regard 172 ing him with a sort of terrified admiration, as though not altogether without hope that a lad of such bloody instincts might commit a homicide in the police court itself, for their especial edification and comfort. All the world, it seemed to Dick, were by this time more than fully informed of the active share he had taken in the assassination of the Russian count, as well as in the progress of Continental Revolution ; his fame had, indeed, already gone forth from the police station, and was becoming metropolitan through the exertions of several scores of street intelligencers, while the tele 172 graphic wires were even then doing their best to render it European. The police alone had hitherto been in possession of the ladâ\\x80\\x99s real name, but there was now no further need for even that concealment ; and theTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 173 Family Scapegrace was fulfilling liis destiny with a vengeance. Dick leaned forward in the Dock with his face buried in his hands, to the great disgust of a gentleman in the crowd connected with one of the illustrated papers â\\x80\\x94who had been sent for post-haste by a member of the force who was in his pay, in order to purvey the lineaments of so remarkable a criminal to the Publicâ\\x80\\x94 and with only the picture of that house in Golden Square before him with its drawn-down blinds. The thought of his dead motherâ\\x80\\x94of the murder that he seemed to have in truth committedâ\\x80\\x94prevented his feeling those apprehensions to which a person in his circumstances would otherwise have doubtless been a prey. There was even a certain miserable consolation in the fact, that this misfortune had befallen him, when, at least, it could wound that long-suffering heart of hers no more. The acute reporters were therefore in error, through whom some half a million of interested readers were informed next morning that â\\x80\\x9c the youthful prisoner was deeply impressed by the sense of his disgraceful position, and the very serious nature of the charges brought against him.â\\x80\\x9d Dick listened to the details of his capture, which A1 delivered from the witness-box, as to some extraneous narrative which had not sufficient interest to win him for ever so short a space from his secret sorrow. It was an original and exciting story, too, and almost all new to him, describing his own superhuman cunning and personal agility, and thereby indirectly evidencing the174 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, sagacity and determination of his captor. When it was finished, there was quite a murmur of applause from the British Public at the spirited conduct of their servant, and they regarded Dick with a renewed wonder, as being athletic as well as sanguinary beyond his years. If the lad had belonged to their own class in life, lie would have had sympathy, and even commendation ; but not being sown in the proper soil, nor of the crop that is usually garnered in police courts, they looked upon him as a something of monstrous growth. â\\x80\\x9c Call the next witness,â\\x80\\x9d said the magistrate. Dick was leaning forward again in his old attitude, with his thoughts wandering away to the lock on the river, and the song which his mother had sung there on that last happy day they had spent together, when a familiar voice struck sharply upon his ear. â\\x80\\x9c Lor, Smith, and whoâ\\x80\\x99d a thought of seeing you here ? Miss Backboard wrote as you were the wickedest boy she had ever seen, but I never believed her until this moment ; though you did run off with the best tortoise-shell â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Hold your tongue, sir,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the magistrate angrily ; â\\x80\\x9c how dare you speak to the prisoner ? Who is this witness ? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s his name, officer ? Why isnâ\\x80\\x99t he sworn 1â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I canâ\\x80\\x99t help it, you see, Smith,â\\x80\\x9d groaned Mr. Tips- away ; I must tell the truth, you know ; itâ\\x80\\x99s perjuryâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Will you be sworn, sir, or will you not?â\\x80\\x9d roared the irascible magistrate. â\\x80\\x9c Now, what have you got to say about the prisoner ?â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 175 â\\x80\\x9c Well, sir, he was a good enough hoy, as far as man 172 ners go, that I will say for him ; hut he was never a good cutter, Smith wasnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Smith ! whoâ\\x80\\x99s Smith ?â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the magistrate. â\\x80\\x9cWe are supposed to know nothing about Smith here. You must tell us your whole story,\\' sir, from beginning to end.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Tipsaway smiled blandly, coughed deliberately, set his hair on end by means of two rapid passes of the fingers of the right hand, and commenced as follows : â\\x80\\x9c My fatherâ\\x80\\x99s name Avas William, sirâ\\x80\\x94the same as my OAvnâ\\x80\\x94but he had not the abilities ever to rise above the spear of an apprentice, though always in the best of establishmentsâ\\x80\\x94but that, of course, is all altered now, and what was fashionable at that time â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Goodness gracious !â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the magistrate, â\\x80\\x9c this person is an idiot. This fellow ought never to have been brought here ; he is not fit to give evidence ; heâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c And you never spoke a truer word nor that, sir, Mr. Policeman, or my name isnâ\\x80\\x99t Martha Tipsaway,â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated a female voice from amid the croAvd. â\\x80\\x9c They would bring him along here, in spite of what I told â\\x80\\x99em, that they might just as Avell have brought the Avig-block from our back-parlour.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Iâ\\x80\\x99ll commit that Avoman,â\\x80\\x9d shrieked the magistrate, â\\x80\\x9c as soon as this case is over ; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll commit her as sure as I sit here.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c And Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to know hoAv youâ\\x80\\x99ll get the case over, Mr. Poâ\\x80\\x9d176 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, Here Mrs. Tipsawayâ\\x80\\x99s voice was arrested so suddenly, as to convey the idea of her windpipe having been com 172 pressed by the human thumb ; and she herself was borne away, gurgling, from the presence, by two of the myrmi 172 dons of the law. â\\x80\\x9c Now look here, witness,â\\x80\\x9d observed the magistrate, with that elaborate calmness which is the offspring of despair, and not of patience. â\\x80\\x9c Do you know why you are put into that box, or do you not ?â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Tipsaway, whose native intellect had been much shattered by the late outbreak on the part of his wife, and who did not know that he had been put into a box, or see any box into which he could be put, except a ridiculously small one of tin upon the magistrateâ\\x80\\x99s table, contented himself with shaking his head slowly and mournfully, and pursing up his lips. â\\x80\\x9c Then take him away,â\\x80\\x9d roared the magistrate, â\\x80\\x9c and put somebody into his place who is a Witness, and not a Tool and a Dummy.â\\x80\\x9d There was a soft and muffled sound, as of an Ã\\x86olian harp, heard for half a second, and Mr. Drizzle, thrusting something hastily into his apron, was ushered into the pen recently occupied by his master. Mr. Frizzleâ\\x80\\x99s trepidation and modesty were so exces 172 sive, that he kissed the policemanâ\\x80\\x99s thumb instead of the book that was presented to him for that purpose, and was rebuked by the official accordingly. â\\x80\\x9c Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a very old trick,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the magistrate indignantly ; â\\x80\\x9c and you had much better not try it 011 in this court, I warn you. Whether you kiss the bookTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 177 or not, mind, you are equally liable to a criminal prose 172 cution.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Frizzleâ\\x80\\x99s bony knees knocked together audibly, and a low and not unmelodious whistle was heard to pervade the court. â\\x80\\x9c Officer, who is that whistling ?â\\x80\\x9d cried the magis 172 trate sharply. â\\x80\\x9c Who is it that dares to whistle while I am speaking ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Please, sir, itâ\\x80\\x99s the witness,â\\x80\\x9d responded a policeman standing immediately beside the wretched Frizzle. â\\x80\\x9c The witness, was it ? â\\x80\\x9d returned the magistrate very quietly, and filling up a sheet of paper that lay before him. â\\x80\\x9c Very good, witness.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Frizzle whistled again. â\\x80\\x9cWhistle once more, witness, and your committal will be made out for one monthâ\\x80\\x99s hard labour. At present, you have got six days of it for contempt of court.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Please, sir,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the prisoner suddenly, â\\x80\\x9c that young man cannot help whistling. He always used to whistle whenever Mr. Tipsaway swore at him, or Mrs. Tipsaway boxed his ears. He always does it when heâ\\x80\\x99s frightened ; and I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe he could stop himself to save his life.â\\x80\\x9d A loud and prolonged chirrup here broke forth from the witness-box, as though to corroborate this testimony. â\\x80\\x9c I never heard such an extraordinary case as this in all my life,â\\x80\\x9d whispered the magistrate to his clerk ; â\\x80\\x9c the only person in the business who seems to have a grain of sense belonging to him, is the boy in custody.â\\x80\\x94178 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, Very well, then,â\\x80\\x9d added he alond ; â\\x80\\x9c you must whistle what you have to say, I suppose, witness, although it is not the usual way of giving evidence in a court of justice. Do you know the prisoner at the bar ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir (whistle) ; and a very nice young man he is, sir (whistle). I never knew anything against the young man, exceptâ\\x80\\x9d Here the witness looked regretfully at Dick, and executed several bars in a tremulous and birdlike manner. â\\x80\\x9c You must tell the whole truth,â\\x80\\x9d cried the magis 172 trate ; â\\x80\\x9c you must not be swayed by pity for the prisoner. What is it that you know against him. You must tell it all.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c He snipped a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s ear-tip, sir, the very last day but two as he was with us,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Frizzle, all in a breath ; after which he sighed, as one who has per 172 formed faithfully a painful duty. â\\x80\\x9cWho has the getting up of this case ?â\\x80\\x9d inquired the magistrate. â\\x80\\x9c Why are these imbecile persons permitted in the witness-box ?â\\x80\\x9d Upon this, a tall, intelligent-looking person, exces 172 sively heatedâ\\x80\\x94one Inspector Lynx, who did (metaphori 172 cally speaking) the Poplar murderâ\\x80\\x94stepped forward, and explained that in his unavoidable absence a mistake had been committed ; it was the female Tipsaway that ought to have been sworn, and not her husband or his apprentice, who could speak to nothing which impli 172 cated the young man in custody. At this statement, Mr. Frizzle gave a feeble smile, and looked round the court, as if some tribute had beenTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 179 paid to liis sagacity and usefulness ; but upon being very sharply directed to stand down, he relapsed again, and tottered paralytically 011 to the bench behind the witness-box, where he was charitably permitted to remain, and whence an occasional smothered â\\x80\\x9c tootâ\\x80\\x9d from his favourite instrument alone gave token of Iris presence and survival. â\\x80\\x9c So you want me after all, Mr. Policeman,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mrs. Tipsaway mounting the steps of the witness-box as though she were a Boadicea, and it were her triumphal car. â\\x80\\x9c Things mostly comes about as 1 expect â\\x80\\x99em to do, somehow. Says I to that poor boy there ; â\\x80\\x98Now, donâ\\x80\\x99t you he a-trying to deceive Martha Tipsaway, for no good will come of that, so sure as your nameâ\\x80\\x99s Bichard Smith which it was, as far as was known to me at that present speaking. We took him in, Mr. Policeman, after a deal of begging and praying, for â\\x80\\x98 You have no character from your last place,â\\x80\\x99 says I. â\\x80\\x98 No,â\\x80\\x99 says he, â\\x80\\x98but I am an orfling, and in want of the necessities of life,â\\x80\\x99 or words to that effect. It was not a prudent thing to do, I am fully aweir of that, my lords and gentlemenâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94observed Mrs. Tipsaway, paren 172 thetically, and waxing into eloquence beyond her subject â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cbut I always was a chicken-hearted, Christian-like body, and we thought it would be made up to us in some way or another, which it hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been in this world, Goodness knows. That lad was as comfortable as any one of us, with his three meals a-day, and table-ale, and what not, learning the fashionablest of styles, along with the respectable young man who has just stood down,180 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, Mr. Policeman, wlio plays so sweetly upon the harpisa- cord, if that is the name you call it, being only a tortoise 172 shell comb and the thinnest of brown paper ; and a most ingenuous performance, as was allowed by Mr. de Cresspinny himself, a nobleman of France. The count was very fond of him, he was, and let him be in the smoking-room with the other emigrates who frequented our establishment, although unknown to him, he spoke the French language like a native.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Oh, this Frizzle was a favourite with these foreign gentlemen, and spoke the French language without their being cognizant of it, did he?â\\x80\\x9d interrogated the magistrate. â\\x80\\x9c Not as I am aweir on,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mrs. Tipsaway, with an air of lofty and abstracted coolness ; â\\x80\\x9c I never heard tell that he did. I am here to speak of what I knows, and not of what I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. If I were asked my private opinion, I should say that Frizzle spoke no other than his native tongue, and that but very imper 172 fectly. He could whistle like any foreign cock-y-olly bird, and a long sight better than most ; but as to his speaking the outlandish lingo of the gents in our â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c It was the prisoner Smith, then, whom you would give us to understand was conversant with the French tongue, and that that fact was unknown to the emigrants who frequented your house ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Smith was the word I used, Mr. Policeman,â\\x80\\x9d re 172 marked Mrs. Tipsaway in a tone of pity and forbearance ; â\\x80\\x9c which, if you will be good enough to listen to, atten 172 tive, and put it down in a book, you will find my wordsTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 181 come true. One day, when I was passing their door, permiscuous, when the others were gone, all except Mr. de Cresspinny and Smithâ\\x80\\x94Smith, not Frizzle, this time, if you will be so good as to keep it in mindâ\\x80\\x94I heard summut as went cold to the pit of my stomach, so that I had to take half a glass of raw brandy almost imme 172 diate, a thing I never touches, except when non compos, Mr. Policeman, as I could get both sides of our house, and, for the matter of that, many over the way, to prove. They was a-talking in a solemn sort of voice, as this might heâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94and from this point Mrs. Tipsaway con 172 tinued her evidence as though she were suffering from an aggravated form of quinsy sore throat. â\\x80\\x9c â\\x80\\x98 I can speak your language,â\\x80\\x99 says Smith, â\\x80\\x98 as I saw him falling down upon his marra-hones through the keyhole, or else may I never speak another word.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The dickens you can,â\\x80\\x99 answers Mr. de Cresspinny ; and I thought he would have choked the young chap, for all the world as Count Gotsucliakoff, as is dead and gone, did, a few days before in that very room, which ought to have come first, Mr. Policeman. That was the poor Itussian who was deaf and dumb. My husband used to call him all manner of names, although I always told him he had better he civil to everybody, for that there was no knowing ; and, indeed, as it turned out, he could hear all the time as well as any person, and better than some people, and if I had said Smith, would never have dreamed that I said Frizzle, nor anything like it. He tried to murder the poor lad in that same room, as 1 believe, although, of course, that was no call why Smith182 EICHAED AEBOÃ\\x9cE ; OE, should get him murdered after all was forgotten and for 172 given, or ought to have been, and a penknife to he stuck into him, or what not, behind a hoarding in such a part of the town, saving your presence, Mr. Policeman, as Poplar. â\\x80\\x98 No, Smith,â\\x80\\x99 says I, â\\x80\\x98 let bygones be by 172 gones â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c On a previous occasion, then,â\\x80\\x9d interposed the magis 172 trate, â\\x80\\x9c this Gotsuchakoff had assaulted the prisoner at the bar in that apartment ? Are you aware of the extent or nature of the provocation upon that occasion ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThere was a thumb-mark and four fingers, Mr. Policeman, as black as your hat upon the ladâ\\x80\\x99s throat, and the bottle of brandy brokeâ\\x80\\x94which, however, was emptied first you may be sure, wherever the poor count wasâ\\x80\\x94and had to be returned, or threepence paid in money, to the Bunch of Grapes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c The magistrate wishes to know what the two quar 172 relled about,â\\x80\\x9d suggested an officer at the witnessâ\\x80\\x99s elbow. â\\x80\\x9c And I daresay he does, which was also my case, and nothing came of it,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mrs. Tipsaway. â\\x80\\x9c The boy was as deep as garret, and as false to me as he was to Mr. T. ; and you see what has come of it, Smith, and are sorry enough, I daresay, when it is too late, as is always the way in this world. â\\x80\\x98 He was not agoing to be knocked about by Kussians,â\\x80\\x99 that was all he said, â\\x80\\x98 or he would know the reason why.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Or he would know the reason why,â\\x80\\x9d repeated the magistrate. â\\x80\\x9cNow, did he make use of that expression revengefully ? Did those words give you the impression of menaceâ\\x80\\x94of paying out a person ?â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 183 â\\x80\\x9c 0 no,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mrs. Tip.saw ay briskly, becoming suddenly aware of the consequences which might flow from a too general and dramatic rendering of what had actually taken place. â\\x80\\x9c On the contrary, Smith seemed particularly forgiving and affable ; he said he didnâ\\x80\\x99t mind, not he, for that it would be all the same two or three days hence.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d remarked the magistrate, â\\x80\\x9cthis was in the same week in which the murder took place ; and the prisoner at the bar observed within your hearing, did he, and with reference to the Russian count, that it would be all the same two or three days hence?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c A hundred years hence, was the exact words he used, Mr. Policeman, though, not being a copy-book, I canâ\\x80\\x99t speak letter for letter, to what a person said, all in a moment. â\\x80\\x98It would be all the same a hundred years hence,â\\x80\\x99 said he ; and I should have thought nothing about it but for this second talk as I overheard between the lad and Mr. de Cresspinny : â\\x80\\x9c â\\x80\\x98 I can speak your language,â\\x80\\x99 says the boy. â\\x80\\x9c â\\x80\\x98 The dickens you can !â\\x80\\x99 says the Prench gentleman in an awful voice. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Ay,â\\x80\\x99 says the boy; â\\x80\\x98but thereâ\\x80\\x99s another as speaks it too, whom you donâ\\x80\\x99t know of.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cWho?â\\x80\\x9d says De Cresspinny, grinding his teeth most terrible. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Why, the Russian,â\\x80\\x99 says the boy, â\\x80\\x98who ainâ\\x80\\x99t no more deaf nor dumb than that â\\x80\\x99ere table. He listens to you, bless you, he does, and knows about all your plots and â\\x80\\x99spiracies ; he keeps all your handwritings in his134 EICHAED ARBOUR; OR, pocket-book ; and if he were searched this moment, you would find them there.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Would you know that pocket-book again, if you were to see it?â\\x80\\x9d asked the magistrate. â\\x80\\x9c Of course I should : it was of Russian leather, as was natural, he being one of â\\x80\\x99em, you know, and I have seen it in his hand again and again.â\\x80\\x94Ay, that is the pocket-book, sure enough, which I can swear to.â\\x80\\x94Well : â\\x80\\x98 I canâ\\x80\\x99t believe it,â\\x80\\x99 says Mr. de Cresspinny. * Why, he has been a humbugging of us for thirty years, if this be true.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9c â\\x80\\x98 But it is true,â\\x80\\x99 says Smith ; â\\x80\\x98 it is, and you may take your Davy on it.â\\x80\\x99 And then the French gentleman swore most dreadful in his own tongue, which I am thankful to think I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t understand; and they came out, and I ran into the back-parlour just in time, and was no more fit for plaiting, let alone delicate hair- work, all that day, than if my fingers had been toes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c And that is all you know about the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s con 172 nection with Mr. de Crespigny and the Russian count?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c That is all, Mr. Policeman, leastways except that when my husband read out of the Dispatch newspaper that a foreign gent had been murdered at Poplar, answer 172 ing to the description of old Dumâ\\x80\\x94or Count Gotsucha- koff, as is the Russian name of himâ\\x80\\x94Smith nearly fainted out of his chair ; and being sent out for a cab, he took hisself off with a couple of best tortoise-shell combs, which have not been returned ; and I have never set eyes upon him since until this day.â\\x80\\x9d This was all that Mrs. Tipsaway had to say of theTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 185 matter, and almost all that anybody else had to say. The hones of the Eussian count and the photograph of his dead body could witness nothing, while not one of the foreign gentlemen who had formerly frequented the perruquierâ\\x80\\x99s shop was now to be found. To commit the lad for trial upon such evidence, fully corroborated by his own voluntary statement of the affair, seemed out of the question ; but on account of the importance and mystery of the case, he was not released, but remanded until that day-week upon the criminal charge.186 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, CHAPTER THE EIGHTEENTH. GOOD SAMARITANS. â\\x80\\x9c It is not a case that admits of bail being taken,â\\x80\\x9d were the last words that smote upon Dickâ\\x80\\x99s ears as he was led out of Court, but it was an unnecessary severity of speech. There was no competition among respectable householders to share the honour of becoming Dickâ\\x80\\x99s security. It seemed, indeed, as if he had cut his moor 172 ings for good and all, as far as concerned that class of persons, and that he was drifting out into the great ocean of scoundreldom, never to come within sight of port again. Nor was there one friendly pilot to put off from either bank, and take the helm, or even to holloa from the last pier-head, as he swept by, a single warning word. He had been in his cell about a couple of hours, and had his untasted dinner lying before him, when a police 172 man entered, with â\\x80\\x9cA lady to see you, young gentle 172 man;â\\x80\\x9d and Dick heard the rustle of a silk garment without daring to lift his eyes. Had Sister Maggie, then, come forth from his dead motherâ\\x80\\x99s room to com 172 fort him ? Nay, did she bring a last message of fare 172 well from those clay-cold lips, after having deliveredTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 187 which, she would depart, and he would see her never more? The poor lad shivered in that unseen presence as our First Parents might have done when the rebukeful angel pointed to the gates of Eden with his flaming sword, and bade them depart for ever. â\\x80\\x9c I have brought you money, my poor boy,â\\x80\\x9d said a tone sisterly indeed, but which was not his sister Maggieâ\\x80\\x99s, â\\x80\\x9cwhich myâ\\x80\\x94that is, which Eichard and Mr. Sunstroke owe- to you. I thought, perhaps, that you might need it here.â\\x80\\x9d Dick stretched out his hands for her to take them in her own with a mute gratitude, but he could not yet look up even into her faceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9ckept darkâ\\x80\\x9d though she might be by Mr. Trimming, out of a due regard to maternal prejudice. â\\x80\\x9c You are very, very good to me,â\\x80\\x9d said he ; â\\x80\\x9c but this is not a place for you to be in. Why didnâ\\x80\\x99t Mr. Sunstroke come to see me ?â\\x80\\x9d Dick would have said, Why didnâ\\x80\\x99t Mr. Jones ?â\\x80\\x94for that was the name by which he always spoke of the photographer to Lucidoraâ\\x80\\x94but that he was anxious to spare her feelings. At this the girl began to sob hysterically, and hide her face in her turn. â\\x80\\x9c You mustnâ\\x80\\x99t mind them, Dick, if they do not seem to feel as you would, who have been brought up properly and all that ; but I would not let them sell your face about the streets, as Sunstroke wished to do, now that you were in trouble and a public charac 172 ter, and I broke the glass, so that they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t take any impressionsâ\\x80\\x94you gave it to me, you know, your-188 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, self, and therefore I had a right to do as I pleased with itâ\\x80\\x94and now Eichard is angry with me, and they donâ\\x80\\x99t know that I am come to you. I am so glad I did though, Dick, for, as I came hurrying into the police-office, there was a letter put into my hand by some personâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t know whoâ\\x80\\x94and I have seen the magistrate to whom it was directed, and he said it was very important, and would do you good.â\\x80\\x9d The lad shook his head, and groaned, as though the time was past wherein anything could do that now. â\\x80\\x9cYou must not take on like that Dick. What is done canâ\\x80\\x99t be undone ; but we can always do better for the future although, added she, with a bitter laugh, â\\x80\\x9c I ainâ\\x80\\x99t quite the one to preach it. The first thing to be done, is to get you out of this ; and the magistrate, who is a kind man, though he interrupts one so, thinks that this may be managed. There was a copy taken of the letter, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve brought it here, only it isnâ\\x80\\x99t the least like the other to look at, which was all written upon paper as thin as a cobweb, and in such a little, little hand, and all in French.â\\x80\\x9d Lucidora produced a document from the magistrateâ\\x80\\x99s office in the stiffest possible handwriting, but containing a very free translation from the original. It bore the date of about a fortnight back, but not the name of the place where it was drawn up, nor had it any heading or superscription other than this ; Declaration concerning the Execution of Alexis Gotsuchakoff, Spy and Traitor. â\\x80\\x9c The following statement has been drawn up by the undersigned at the especial request of one of them, HenriTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 189 de Crespigny, to be laid before the police magistrate or other authority before whom one Eichard Smith may at any time be summoned in connection with the fate of the above-named Count Alexis Gotsuchakoff, lawfully done to death on Wednesday last, at midnight, and in accordance with an enactment against traitors which he himself had subscribed. â\\x80\\x9c It is true that the lad was the discoverer of the treachery of that man, inasmuch as he was the first to in 172 form one of us of the countâ\\x80\\x99s not being a mute, which Got 172 suchakoff had successfully pretended to be for more than thirty years ; but he was certainly unaware of the im 172 portance of such a disclosure, and far less could he have anticipated the punishment which it justly entailed upon that unhappy man. â\\x80\\x9cWhen Eichard Smith had informed M. de Cres 172 pigny of the countâ\\x80\\x99s having spoken the French tongue in his hearing, as well as of his having certain docu 172 ments in his possession, which he (the count) professed to have destroyed, affecting the lives and liberties of the undersigned, as well as those of hundreds of innocent persons, whose betrayal he was in that case plotting, M. de Crespigny at once repaired to Herr Singlerâ\\x80\\x99s lodging â\\x80\\x94it being then about seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the evening. Having communicated to him the above intelligence, the two went separately out, for the purpose of calling together the principal members of our Society, with the exception of Count Gotsuchakoff, for immediate and important deliberation. â\\x80\\x9c In a little time, the chiefs of the Society then in190 RICHARD ARBOTJR ; OR, London, comprising representatives from every Euro 172 pean nation, and numbering five-and-twenty persons, assembled at the rooms of M. de Crespigny, as being the most commodious for that purpose, where the circum 172 stances which have been described were laid before them. It was decided that four should be selected out of that body by ballot, to go at once to Count Gotsucha- koffs, apd acquaint themselves certainly with the truth or falsehood of this chargeâ\\x80\\x94the most hateful that can be preferred against a fellow-creature, and therefore one the proof of which it is necessary to place beyond all doubt before proceeding to act upon it. The persons thus selected were Henri de Crespigny, Rudolph Singler, Antonio Castigliano, and Suwarrow Blaskiâ\\x80\\x94the last being a countryman of the accused person. â\\x80\\x9c In case of proven guilt, the execution of Alexis Gotsuchakoff was intrustedâ\\x80\\x94a dreadful but necessary and sacred dutyâ\\x80\\x94to the hands of these four persons. The two first mentioned preceded the other two, in order to avoid observation, to the countâ\\x80\\x99s lodgings in Poplar, and found him retired to his sleeping-chamber, although it was then scarce eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and it was his general custom to sit up very late at night. â\\x80\\x9c He observedâ\\x80\\x94talking with his fingers, as he always didâ\\x80\\x94that he was not well, being overtired with the protracted sitting of the Society during that day. There was a haggard and terrified look about him while he stated this, never beheld in him before, and which con 172 vinced the spectators that he guessed the nature and reason of their unseasonable visit.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 191 â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cWe wish,â\\x80\\x99 cried M. de Crespigny, speaking aloud, and looking sternly at the wretched man, â\\x80\\x98 to examine your pocket-book, with those slips of paper in our hand 172 writing in it, which you have omitted to burn this day.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9c It was terrible to see how pale and terror-stricken the count turned at this, his fingers trembling so that they could scarcely form the denial which he gave by their means, in order to keep up the notion that he could not speak ; although, in his agitation, lie forgot that hy that very denial he was acknowledging that he was at least able to hear. â\\x80\\x9c At the same moment, Castigliano and Blaski entered. I have asked this man,â\\x80\\x99 said De Crespigny, address 172 ing himself to them, â\\x80\\x98 who has never understood word of mine (as he has made me believe) for thirty years, to see the slips in my own handwriting and yours, which he carries in his pocket-book, and he replies with his fingers â\\x80\\x94as though he could not use his tongue as well as his earsâ\\x80\\x94that he has them not.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9c â\\x80\\x98 I suppose the lad at the perruquiers told you,â\\x80\\x99 observed Gotsuchakoff in the Drench language ; which, to every one there presentâ\\x80\\x94notwithstanding what they had been made acquainted withâ\\x80\\x94seemed like some prodigious miracle. â\\x80\\x98 If I had not been so mercifully faint-hearted, I should have killed him. It is hard that thirty years of success in such a part as mine should have been con 172 cluded by a rascal boy, whom, if ever again I meetâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9c â\\x80\\x98 Silence, wretched man ! â\\x80\\x99 cried De Crespignyâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 silence, and think of your lies no more. There is no192 EICHAED ABSQUE; OB, plotting in the grave, no traitorâ\\x80\\x99s work to be done among the dead ; and vengeance is for us, and not for you!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98So you came to murder me?â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed the count, half-rising in his bed, and thereby disclosing that he was fully dressed, and had only made pretence of illness. The Society has decreed your death,â\\x80\\x99 returned De Crespigny. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98So soon V ejaculated the countâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 so soon, and with 172 out trial ? What good can my death then do to it ? I will make it a terror to kings, if you let me live. Have I served its foes for thirty years, counterplotting, revealing, destroying for them, without being trusted, think you, in return ? I swear to you that I will henceforth serve it alone.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98It needs no traitors,â\\x80\\x99exclaimedCastigliano, snatching the pocket-book, a corner of which he perceived protrud 172 ing from beneath the pillow. â\\x80\\x98 See, here are the slips upon which we wrote this very afternoon, and that he made believe to burn; any one of which would be our death-warrant in the place where he would have sent them. What has the traitor written here, Blaski ? It is in your own language.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98It is the entire detail of our plan of to-day,â\\x80\\x99 returned the Russian. The other three crowded round to look over his shoulder as he translated, and Count Gotsucha- koff seized the moment to leap from the bed, and make for the door of the sitting-room. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98It is locked,â\\x80\\x99 said De Crespigny quietly, as his companions rushed upon the unhappy wretch, and carried him back into the inner chamber, bound and gagged. â\\x80\\x98ITHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 193 knew that such a traitor would never have the courage to meet his end like a man.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9c At this moment, a step was heard upon the stairs, and the lodging-house keeper knocked at the outer-door, inquiring whether anything would be wanted before she retired for the night. The count will require nothing more,â\\x80\\x99 replied Herr Singler ; â\\x80\\x98 we are all going out in a little, and have per 172 suaded him. to accompany us.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9c Then they turned the man with his face towards the wall, while they arranged the manner of his death, and drew lots for him whose hand should perform the deed. Next, they wrapped the countâ\\x80\\x99s cloak around him, and a woollen comforter about his mouth to conceal the gag, and two of them took him between them into the street to an unfrequented spot, close by, which had been agreed upon. When they reached that spot, and found themselves alone, the one upon whom the lot had fallen struck the fatal blow with a sharp poniard, and the body was placed out of sight behind a hoarding of planks. â\\x80\\x9c The above is copied, word for word, from the minutes of the Society which organised the deed. It desires not to excuse its proceedings in this declaration, or in the eyes of him to whom it is addressed ; else it could easily set forth reasons abundantly sufficient for the execution of the traitor in question, as one who had caused to be committed, and for the sake of blood-money, the judicial murder of many hundreds of persons, as well as brought imprisonment, exile, and ruin upon their helpless wives and children ; and who, moreover, within the very hour194 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, of his death, was disclosing, to those who hired him, a certain scheme of that Society of which he was a sworn member, the betrayal of which would have brought scores of honest men to the scaffold, and of noble ladies to shame. The sole purpose, however, of this declaration is to set forth that the lad, Richard Smith, employed at the perruquier Tipsawayâ\\x80\\x99s, has had nothing whatever to do with this matter, except so far as has been already stated, and had neither share nor knowledge of the execution of Alexis Gotsuchakoff.\\' (Signed) â\\x80\\x9c Henri de Crespigny. â\\x80\\x9c Rudolph Singler. â\\x80\\x9c Antonio Castigliano. â\\x80\\x9c SUWARROW BlASKI.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c There, you see they acknowledge that you had nothing to do with it,â\\x80\\x9d cried Lucidora, â\\x80\\x9c and the magistrate believed it too ; of that I am sure. I dare say, the Russian deserved it, poor fellow, telling upon people that had trusted him through all these years ; but it was an awful end. What a thing it would have been to have met him in the street between those other two, bound and gagged, and walking to his death among crowds of people that would have rescued him if they had only known !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Horrible, most horrible !â\\x80\\x9d cried Hick with a shudder ; â\\x80\\x9c and but for me, it would never have happened ; and yet I would expose a wretch like that to his dupes, if it all was to be done again to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x9d replied Lucidora doubtfully ; â\\x80\\x9c I think it is ill work to be meddling with those foreignTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 195 folks. Do you know that the magistrateâ\\x80\\x94who thought I was your sister at first, I thinkâ\\x80\\x94said that the whole business was so grave that it would probably have to be laid before the Home Secâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cA gentleman to see you,â\\x80\\x9d cried the janitor, suddenly opening the door ; at which Mrs. Jones slunk into a corner petrified, under the impression that the august personage to whom she had alluded was at hand, about to pay a visit of ceremony to the accused person, pre 172 paratory, perhaps, to his being led forth to immediate execution. â\\x80\\x9c Why, my poor boy, Richard,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the visitor, who was no other than good Mr. Mickleham, â\\x80\\x9cwhat a position is this I find you in, and what a blow it would have been to pottery in case you had really been con 172 cerned in this assassination ! You have, however, as I just learn, only to appear before the magistrate, and go through a legal form of release, and then you will come home with me to Kensington. My solicitor assures me that there was scarcely any ground at all for your re 172 mand. There, there, Richard, do nâ\\x80\\x99t cry, my ladâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t disturb yourself, although of course it was hard to hear them patteringâ\\x80\\x94that is what they call it, I believeâ\\x80\\x94 pattering the broad-sheets about your apprehension and personal appearance immediately opposite your uncleâ\\x80\\x99s establishment. Your names being identical is, without doubt, a great misfortune ; and it would have certainly saved us much annoyance if you had been related to him upon your motherâ\\x80\\x99s side instead of your fatherâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d At these words the flush of glad surprise which had196 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, risen into the boyâ\\x80\\x99s cheeks at the news of his speedy enfranchisement, faded off at once, and he sunk down into his chair again, with â\\x80\\x9c My motherâ\\x80\\x94my poor mother ; there is no pardon for my having murdered her !\" â\\x80\\x9cRichard Arbour,â\\x80\\x9d cried the old gentleman kindly, â\\x80\\x9cI am glad to see this sorrow for your late undutiful con 172 duct, but I do not wish to see you despair : he comforted, for your poor motherâ\\x80\\x99s death does not lie at your door. She had been ailing for many months, and even years, and her end was expected even before it came. Doubt 172 less, it would have pleased her to have seen your face by her bedside, hut it could not have saved her. I may tell you, even, that your sister Margaret was of opinion that it would have distressed her mother more to see the disagreements between yourself and certain members of your family, than to know, by your letters, that you were at least cheerful-hearted and not in want. I doubt whether I am right in saying so much, since it may only encourage you in your roving and indeed vagabondâ\\x80\\x9d But by this time Dick was upon his knees mum 172 bling the old gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s hand as though it were ginger 172 bread, and Mr. Mickleham could not somehow conclude his valuable remarks ; his nose, if one might judge from a very ostentatious use of his pocket-handkerchief, putting in a prior claim to his attention. There was also a sobbing noise, as of a cistern-pipe in difficulties, from an obscure corner of the cell, which caused Mr. Mickleham to inquire into its nature with the greatest apparent interest. â\\x80\\x9c It is a very good friend of mine, sir,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick softlyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthe only one, to say truth, who would haveTHE FAMILY SCAPEGBACE. 197 been likely to come and see me here, except yourself. Lucidora â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Lucidora ! â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the old gentleman suspi 172 ciouslyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c what a very singular name ! â\\x80\\x9d The young lady thus alluded to came quickly for 172 ward, wiping her eyes, and took Dickâ\\x80\\x99s hand, which he extended to her very gratefully. â\\x80\\x9c I am glad, Master Richard Arbour, that you are going amongst your friends again, and to live with respectable people. This gentle 172 man, I see, considers me very far from that, and com 172 pany fit for neither him nor you.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c No, no,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Mickleham nervously ; â\\x80\\x9creally I never meantâ\\x80\\x94dear me, noâ\\x80\\x94doubtless a most respects able young personâ\\x80\\x94but Lucidoraâ\\x80\\x94such a very singular nameâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Sir, you are quite right,â\\x80\\x9d replied the girl, not with 172 out some dignity. â\\x80\\x9c I should, however, not have been here at all, if I had thought this poor lad would have had any help from my betters. My own experience has been, that when folks get into trouble, their respectable friends are not very active in getting them out of it.â\\x80\\x9d With which remark, the young lady left the room, and with such a sweeping curtsy to Mr. Mickleham, that the wind of it seemed to take away the old gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s breath for several seconds. â\\x80\\x9c She has been exceedingly good and kind to me,â\\x80\\x9d observed Dick apologetically. â\\x80\\x9cIndeed!â\\x80\\x9d responded the other drily, and drawing on his gloves. â\\x80\\x9c I trust, however, that in future it will not be necessary for you to cultivate similar friend-198 BICHAED AEBOUK ; OE, ships.

It is just as well that you have not touched that dinner, Dick, for it would have been throwing away anything like an appetite to have eaten it ; and, gracious goodness, what a miserable taste in crockery! The commonest delf, and the very ugliest pattern that can be got in Staffordshire! â\\x80\\x9d And with an expression of regret that the police should neglect so powerful a means for the reformation of criminals as well-selected earthenware, Mr. Mickle- ham led the way to the magistrate.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 199 CHAPTEE THE NINETEENTH. THE EXCOMMUNICATION. When Mrs. Benjamin Arbour had been buried, in such a manner as did no discredit to that respectable firm to which she had the honour of being allied by marriage, there was still another solemnity to be held in Golden Square upon that same afternoon. The actors in it were the entire Arbour familyâ\\x80\\x94Adolphus, Maria, Johnnie, Margaret, and Uncle Ingram, with Dick added â\\x80\\x94as the race-cards say of any extraneous matter. He had come that morning from Mr. Micklehamâ\\x80\\x99s house at Kensington, by express invitation, to attend his motherâ\\x80\\x99s funeral, but neither his uncle nor his other relatives had so much as taken his hand in theirs, with the exception of Sister Maggie. She had never set eyes on him since that happy day on the river long ago ; new experiences of life had altered his looks and made a man of him in the meantime, but her heart seemed to know no change, but beat responsive as of old to his in a long embrace of love. â\\x80\\x9c She bade me give you this, and this,â\\x80\\x9d she whis 172 pered, kissing him tenderly ; â\\x80\\x9c whatever is said of poor200 BICHABD AEBOÃ\\x9cE ; OE, mamma to-day, Richard, and whoever says it, remember, if it be a word of rebuke for you, that it is not true.â\\x80\\x9d Maggie knew what pangs of self-reproach were rankling in the hoy, for Lucy Mickleham had written to her every day about him, while her father had even paid a visit to Golden Square in person in the vain hope of moving Mr. Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s heart towards the prodigal. Luncheon was laid out upon the sideboard of the dining-room when the gentlemen came home, and its place upon the huge mahogany table was occupied by the family Bible. Uncle Ingram having assembled the family and closed the door, seated himself opposite to the volume, as though it were a ledger, and selecting a broad-nibbed pen from the standish, filled it carefully with ink. â\\x80\\x9c Richard Arbour,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9c it is not my purpose to embitter the feeling which I am told you are beginning â\\x80\\x94tardily enoughâ\\x80\\x94to entertain regarding the wicked undutifulness of your past life, by any remarks of mine. When I was in the position of your natural protector, and was paying for your support and education, I some 172 times thought it my duty to remonstrate with you upon your misbehaviour ; but as, from this date, I give up all charge concerning you, and wash my hands of you and your future actions altogether, I spare you further cen 172 sure. I say nothing of the manner in which you have resolutely opposed yourself to every plan for your own prosperity and well-doing. I say nothing of the wrong you have done to those whose greatest weakness has been a blind attachment to an unworthy objectâ\\x80\\x94your-THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. m 201 self ; nor of the serious pecuniary expense that I have been put to for your maintenance up to this time. Your share of your motherâ\\x80\\x99s property, who would pro 172 bably but for you have been living nowâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9c Uncle, uncle !â\\x80\\x9d appealed Margaret passionately. â\\x80\\x9c Well, then, to cany out my intention strictly, and not to hint at what has been done or undone, your for 172 tune of Â£G00, sir, lies in that pocket-book, and you may take it away with you when you leave this house.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Keep it, sir, and pay yourself out of it !â\\x80\\x9d replied Richard doggedly ; â\\x80\\x9c I will never accept one farthing of it from such a hand.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt will be paid into my bankerâ\\x80\\x99s to your name, then,â\\x80\\x9d returned the merchant coolly, â\\x80\\x9c to be spent when you please and how you please, which, if we may judge from the company you have been recently keeping, will be disreputably enough ; but mind, when that is gone, you never have one guinea more from me ; no, not one shilling to rub against anotherâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I do not want to rub one of your shillings against another,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Dick, maddened by the contemp 172 tuous malice that sat upon the countenances of his eldest brother and sister, as much as by his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s cruel scorn. â\\x80\\x9c What have I done ?â\\x80\\x9d cried he, turning so sharply round upon Adolphus that that gentleman drew in his legs with great rapidityâ\\x80\\x94which before were luxu 172 riating at utmost length, as the legs of one who is seeing justice done upon the wicked at no personal riskâ\\x80\\x94and put himself into a posture of self-defence ; â\\x80\\x9c what have I done that I should be treated thus vilely by you all ?202 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, I have stood it often for the sake of her who is gone, and whose loss not one of you, save Maggie yonder, has a single tear for ; but I am not going to stand it now.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c He is about to butcher his eldest brother,â\\x80\\x9d observed Maria, with acrimonious distinctness ; â\\x80\\x9c he is nothing less than a second Cain.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ay, and he is Able, too,â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick with epi 172 grammatic ferocity, and excited, as usual, to frenzy by that sisterly voice. â\\x80\\x9c Silence, Maria ; do not touch him, Adolphus,â\\x80\\x9d ex 172 claimed Mr. Arbour sternly ; â\\x80\\x9c you have done with him from henceforth as well as myself. You ask what you have done, sir, do you, to deserve this treatment ? I will tell you, then. You have killed your motherâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c That is a lie,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick furiously ; â\\x80\\x9c and there is none who knows it better than yourself.â\\x80\\x9d The corners of Mr. Ingram Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s mouth gave a twitch at this, the resultant of two forcesâ\\x80\\x94anger at his nephewâ\\x80\\x99s insult, and consciousness of having been really somewhat hard upon the deceased lady. â\\x80\\x9cYou have killed your mother,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, â\\x80\\x9cor at least have shortened her life by your undutiful ways ; you have associated â\\x80¢ with conspirators, andâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94haircutters ; you have voluntarily abandoned, I say, that station of life into which, as your catechism very properly remarks, it has pleased Heaven to call you, and connected your 172 self with a set ofâ\\x80\\x9d : here Mr. Ingram Arbour, whose indignation had caused him to rashly leave the safe cur- rentof speech-prepared-beforehand, for the eddies of extem 172 poraneous discourse, grounded heavily upon a sand-bar.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 203 â\\x80\\x9cA set of bloodthirsty assassins!â\\x80\\x9d suggested sister Maria. â\\x80\\x9cA set of bloodthirsty and continental assasins,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Uncle Ingram, making the remark his own by extension of epithet. â\\x80\\x9c That is not true, sir,â\\x80\\x9d returned the hardy Dick, as lie thought of kind Mr. de Crespigny. â\\x80\\x9c You have been in the hands of the police, and narrowly escaped from the imputation of murder ; our name has been hawked about the streets, through you, in connection with a capital crime ; you are a disgrace to the family, sir, and you belong to it from this moment no longer. And with that Uncle Ingram drew the broad nibbed pen through the name of Richard Arbour, which was written on the fly-leaf of the book before him, whose mission was to preach forgiveness of all injuries. That name had been inscribed there, with faltering fingers, by the poor ladâ\\x80\\x99s father, when he lay a-dying, some sixteen years ago, whose own name also stood above it, written in the heyday of his life, when he and his Leety were but newly married. Richard did not ask himself whether the deed was just, or if so, whether his uncle had the right to execute it ; he only felt as though some terrible and inexorable excommunication had been pronounced against him, which he had not the power to despise or set at nought. The occurrences of his short life which had led to such a scene, and especially those tremendous ones that had thronged the last few days of it, whirled through his204 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, brain so fast, that he could scarcely hear what was pass 172 ing. He knew that Maggie was interceding for him, and that Mr. Arbour was replying to her obdurately, and that was all. â\\x80\\x9c It is of no use, uncle,â\\x80\\x9d at last he heard her say ; â\\x80\\x9c for flesh and blood is stronger than pen and ink.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c \"VVe will see, he answered, more bitterly than he was accustomed to speak to his favourite niece ; â\\x80\\x9c we will put that to the test at once. You, Adolphusâ\\x80\\x94 I begin with you, my eldest nephew and my heir, although all who are here present, save one, will have no reason when I die to complain that I have left them unprovided for. Are you prepared to forget your rela 172 tionship to this fellow here ; to neither speak nor write to him ; to treat him as though he had met with that fate which the law has been within a little of awarding him ? Will you swear upon this sacred book, I say, to abjure him as one of the family, and so to express your sanction of the act of justice which has just now been done by me ?â\\x80\\x9d The look which, in the capacity of Head of the Family, Adolphus assumed upon this solemn adjuration, was a sight to see ; he appeared to have borrowed half of it from the rÃ´le of Brutus in the act of sacrificing his sons for the commonwealth, while the other half (which was his own), bore a strong resemblance to that more modern hero of the dramaâ\\x80\\x94Tartuffe. â\\x80\\x9c It is a very painful duty, uncle Ingram, but it is my duty, and being so, I should be wrong to shrink â\\x80¢from it. Brother Bichard,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, â\\x80\\x9c as after ITHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 205 have taken this oath, our intercourse will cease, I ask of you if you have any final observation to make before I do so.â\\x80\\x9d This hypocritical address acted upon Dickâ\\x80\\x99s prostrate condition like a cordial dram ; he felt the embers of indignation kindle once more within him, and had a difficulty in suppressing an impudent twinkle of his downcast eyes, as he replied : â\\x80\\x9c 1 have one thing to say, Adolphus, but it should not be said here.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I have no secrets with such as you,â\\x80\\x9d responded the other, loftily ; â\\x80\\x9c whatever you have to speak must be spoken here, and in my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s presence. If I can carry out any last wish of yours, sir, consistent with duty, with honesty, and with proper feeling, I shall be happy to do so.â\\x80\\x9d The mantle, or toga, of Brutus here seemed to forsake the shoulders of Mr. Adolphus Arbour, and his air resembled greatly that of Mr. Calcraft, the hangman, when demanding of a gentleman about to be artistically dealt with, whether there is anything, which, after the ceremony, he can have the pleasure of doing for him. â\\x80\\x9cThere is one thing, brother Adolphus,â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick, in a confidential whisper which could be heard all over the roomâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c there is one thing consistent with the virtues you have mentioned, that I do think you ought to do : you should keep your word with your uncleâ\\x80\\x99s maid, poor Betsy, and marry her at your very earliest convenience.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI swear!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Adolphus, viciously, missing in his blind fury the volume which he would have206 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, struck with Ms clenched fist, and overturning the ink- bottle. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Dick, drily; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m glad youâ\\x80\\x99ve sworn it; and now I do hope youâ\\x80\\x99ll get the bans published as soon as possible.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMaria!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Ingram Arbour, pallid with rage at this introduction of the comic element into a scene which .was intended to have been profoundly grave, â\\x80\\x9c you have heard what I have said to your elder brother ; are you likewise prepared to give up this ribald hoy, and to forget that he ever bore our family name to its disgrace ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI am,â\\x80\\x9d returned that young lady, regarding the outcast biliously ; â\\x80\\x9c and it would have been better, in my judgment, if this thing had been done before.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSwear away,â\\x80\\x9d observed Dick, with cheerfulness. â\\x80\\x9cI can only regret, Maria, that I can get nobody to promise to marry you.â\\x80\\x9d Mariaâ\\x80\\x99s yellow countenance was shot with scarlet, like some inexpensive silk, as she abandoned the lad as her brother for ever and ever, but she did not venture upon expressing her indignation in words again. â\\x80\\x9cAnd you, John, are you, too, prepared to let all connection cease between this fellow and yourself?â\\x80\\x9d Johnny Arbour had no absolute malignity in his nature, and would not willingly have hurt a fly, unless the act had been of manifest benefit to himâ\\x80\\x94in which case, however, he would have sacrificed the entire human family without the least internal struggle. He did not â\\x80\\x9c see the goodâ\\x80\\x9d of a domestic condemnation suchTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 207 as tlie present, wherein, moreover, as far as words went, the proposed victim was clearly getting the best of it ; and he walked up to the table with much such mis 172 givings as some Tory voter who approaches the polling- booth secure indeed of the final triumph of his candidate, hut also aware that there are rotten eggs and cabbage stalks to be got from the unrepresented democracy who wait outside the threshold. â\\x80\\x9c Brother John,â\\x80\\x9d cried Dick, arresting him in the act of ostracism, â\\x80\\x9c as you have the Bible there, will you swear upon it that it was not yourself who cut Bill Dempseyâ\\x80\\x99s eye out with a snow-ball, years ago, and laid the blame on me ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI swear,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Johnny hastily, turning pale as death, and tottering to his seat, as though he had just- been struck off the roll of practising attorneys. \"You may here perceive,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Dick, with the air of a showman exhibiting a wax-work ruffian in some â\\x80\\x9cBoom of Horrorsâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cyou may here perceive how a young man looks, from head to foot, who has just com 172 mitted a perjury.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c My dear Margaret,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Ingram Arbour, â\\x80\\x9c it is now your turn to do your duty. You have learned from his own mouth within the last few minutesâ\\x80\\x94if you entertained any doubt of it beforeâ\\x80\\x94what sort of charac 172 ter this young man really is ; how insolent, how malig 172 nant, how wanting in all self-respect as well as in re 172 spect to others.

It is because I was with her then and at all times, and know the wishes of her loving soul so well, that I would not now desert this boy of hers although his weaknesses were ingrained vices (which they are not), and his follies crimes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I do not wish to be angry with you, Margaret,â\\x80\\x9d returned the old man firmly; â\\x80\\x9chut I must he obeyed by you as well as by others. Whoever of you from this day forth holds intercourse with that boy yonder, whether by speech or letter, will derive no benefit from what I have to leave behind ; their name, so help me Heaven, shall never so much as be written in my will.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c My own dear sister Maggie,â\\x80\\x9d cried Dick suddenly, â\\x80\\x9c do not cross your uncle in this matter for the sake of me, I pray. I shouldâ\\x80\\x94indeed I shouldâ\\x80\\x94be far more wretched in the thought that I had been the cause of your being left unprovided for, of any wrong being done to you, than even in the knowledge that we were never more to meet in this world. This man cannot preventTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 209 my loving you ; he can hinder our hands from clasping, but that is all.â\\x80\\x9d Maggie heard him with a proud smile of love and triumph, hut when he ended, only shook her golden hair for answer to him. â\\x80\\x9cAnd think you, Uncle Ingram,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed she â\\x80\\x9c that I would barter such a love as thatâ\\x80\\x94one single kiss, one hand-clasp, one kind wordâ\\x80\\x94for the being set down in a dead manâ\\x80\\x99s will ?â\\x80\\x9d So scornfully the girlâ\\x80\\x99s eyes flashed upon him that the old man did not care to meet them with his own, but kept his face averted, and with his fingers tore the pen that had crossed Eichardâ\\x80\\x99s name out into fragments. â\\x80\\x9cI did not think so, Margaret,â\\x80\\x9d answered he, in suppressed tones, and with some effort ; â\\x80\\x9c and I meant to use no threat, or at least not only threats. Have I earned nothing at your hands, niece ? Have I not ever been kind and true to you? Have I ever refused a request in reason? Have I not shewn my love in a thousand ways ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou have, uncle; and far oftener than I have deserved. If some of that kindness, some of that con 172 sideration, some of that love, had been shewn to that poor boy yonderâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSilence, girl!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Arbour, fiercely; â\\x80\\x9cdo not dictate to me what I should have done, or what I should have left undone. I have humbled myself too much already to you, and now, as I perceive, to little purpose. 1 was but recapitulating what I have felt towards you, in order to let you know, that while remembering itâ\\x80\\x94 k 2210 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, that in despite of itâ\\x80\\x94I was prepared to punish your disobedience as it deserved. We have had talk enough, and I waste my words no longer about this matter. As sure as I stand here, a living man, if you abjure not the companionship of that boy, now and for ever, you will find yourself portionless, penniless, or with only that miserable pittance between yourself and beggary as lies here now, between him and the jail which will receive him when it is spent.â\\x80\\x94That is well, Margaret,â\\x80\\x9d continued the old man in a triumphant tone, as the girl rose, while he spoke, and with pallid lips laid her hand upon the still open Bible ; â\\x80\\x9c that is well, child, and you will swear while there is yet time, I know.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I swear,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Margaret firmly, â\\x80\\x9c in the presence, for all that I can tell, of the sainted soul of that ladâ\\x80\\x99s mother, who was buried this day, that I will never desert him, or forget that he is her son and my own brother, from this day forth until the day I die.â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 211 CHAPTER THE TWENTIETH. AMONG FRIENDS.\\' The domestic shell having thus exploded without alto 172 gether confining itself in the direction intended by the astonished bombardier, there was Chaos enough in that respectable Golden Square dining-room without the discordant element of Dickâ\\x80\\x99s presence. He wisely con 172 cluded that he would only be making matters worse by remaining, and so he unceremoniously left the room at once. Mrs. Trimming, suspiciously near the door, was in the hall to receive him, to fold him in her substantial arms, to drop upon his exiled brow her sympathetic tears. â\\x80\\x9c Itâ\\x80\\x99s a sin and shame, Master Dick ; but itâ\\x80\\x99s along of that young Mr. Adolphus who misleads your uncle ; it done my heart good to see you a sticking up to him. My Richardâ\\x80\\x94Mr. Jones, I meanâ\\x80\\x94always told me as how it would come to that. â\\x80\\x98Some day or another,â\\x80\\x99 says heâ\\x80\\x94but I am glad you did not touch him, for you should never lay hand upon your own flesh and bloodâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9c it will be Dick versus Dolly with a vengeance.â\\x80\\x9d Hereâ\\x80\\x99s a note for you from him, which I was to be very parti-212 EICHAED AEBOXJE ; OE, cular to put into yoiir own hand. God bless you, my dear hoy ; and if ever a five-pound note, or, for the matter of that, a ten Heaven preserve us, hereâ\\x80\\x99s my master !â\\x80\\x9d The young outlaw seized the handle of the front door, and hastened with considerable asperity to place that visible barrier between himself and his sometime relative ; -but the next moment his hat, weighty with its trappings of woe, brought to mind the sorrow which had only been in abeyance during the preceding scene, and he took his homeward way, weeping and despondent â\\x80\\x94not because he had been disinherited, but because he had been bereaved and orphaned. The little villa at Kensington, to which he was now returning, had been for the last few days a home indeed to him. Mr. Mickleham had never alluded to any of the circumstances which had brought him there, save when he himself had evinced a wish to speak of them, but had treated him with the courtesy of a host as weli as the interest of a father. Lucy was never tired of talking with him of his sister Maggie, and now and then, when she saw he was more than commonly depressed, of his dead mother ; for she also had known what that loss is, and how far better it is to speak of such a grief than to shut it up in the lonely heart which is its prey. Now and then, too, in gayer moments, she would slily advert to the deterioration of her hair, which, she persisted, had never recovered the injury it had received at the hands of a certain incompetent person. â\\x80\\x9cIt was only one little, little curl,â\\x80\\x9d remonstratedTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 213 Dick, imagining at first that she had discovered the loss of her missing ringlet. â\\x80\\x9c I stole it, I confess, but who would not have been a thief and picked a lock under such temptation !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to say that you have stolen a lock of my hair, you wicked, wicked boy ! â\\x80\\x9d cried the girl, blushing ; but it is probable that she would not have sent him across the seas for that offence, if it had lain in her power, nor, indeed, to any great distance from Kensington. She was always persuading him to go back to Darkendim Street, and be reconciled to his uncleâ\\x80\\x94incited thereto by her papaâ\\x80\\x94and built up con 172 siderable hopes of his turning out a sort of Industrious Apprentice, to be eventually a lord mayor of London, after all. Dick was born to be misunderstood by his friends as well as to be condemned by his enemies. There was another person in the little Kensington household, too, who helped to make it a paradise for the young rogue, deserving though he was of altogether different quarters. Mr. Mickleham had a son William, about ten years older than Dick, and after that ladâ\\x80\\x99s own heart. Not that Mr. William was irreclaimable, erratic, vagabondish, or any one of those many adjec 172 tives which yoke so harmoniously with the word Scape 172 grace, but he had a tenderness for those that were. All literary menâ\\x80\\x94I speak it to their honourâ\\x80\\x94with the exception of a few of the heavier sort, (the sumpter mules of the profession, who carry all the classical quotations for us), have an eye of pity and an open hand for the poor mauvais sujets to whom Society presents214* RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, quite another portion of her person, or even her clenched fist (for in spite of her fine-lady airs and assumptions of indifference, she can shew herself a considerable virago where she thinks it safe to do so) and Mr. William Mickleham was to some extent â\\x80\\x9c a literary man : â\\x80\\x9d not openly and avowedly so, indeedâ\\x80\\x94for such a confession would have shocked his father into an apo 172 plexyâ\\x80\\x94but he mitigated the rigours of a government clerkship by an occasional flirtation with the muse, and regarded her clandestine offspring with that affection, the depth of which no man, who has not similarly sinned himself, can ever plumb. He was not a poet in any high sense of the term, of course ; Heaven is not so superfluous as to permit people in the enjoyment of government situations to be also great geniuses ; but he had a deeper knowledge of human nature than is pos 172 sessed by most persons. In particular, he had an insight of appreciation denied to many a one of keener intellect. Where a mere man of the world beheld a mental defor 172 mity, William Mickleham detected the latent cause of its outgrowth, and found it not always a weakness. Other men in his office could â\\x80\\x9c spot â\\x80\\x9d their companions with equal accuracyâ\\x80\\x94an expressive metaphor, though borrowed, I believe, from the billiard-tableâ\\x80\\x94but he knew what they were fit for, not only what they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t do : he understood more than that the round hole was unsuited to them, and could sometimes indicate the polygon which should be dug for their especial accom 172 modation. It was abundantly clear to him that the hole in Darkendim Street, wherein his father had found him-THE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 215 self so comfortable for so many years, was of far too exact proportions ever to suit that very irregular figure, Master Richard Arbour. â\\x80\\x9c If you were my son, Dick,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Mr. Mickle- ham, junior, with relation to this matter, on the third night of the ladâ\\x80\\x99s acquaintance with himâ\\x80\\x94by which time he had gained his confidence as easily as ever Jesuit mastered that of womanâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c if you were my son, I tell you honestly, you should go to sea to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Say the day after,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick, flippantly ; â\\x80\\x9c to 172 morrowâ\\x80\\x99s a Friday for the subject of his future pro 172 spects had got by this time to be rather an exacerbating one to the young gentleman. â\\x80\\x9c Itâ\\x80\\x99s wonderful how constant the symptoms of your disease are in every case,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the philosopher musingly, puffing at a long churchwarden pipe, with its bowl half-way up the chimney, in order that the smell of tobacco might not pervade the house ; â\\x80\\x9c itâ\\x80\\x99s impossible to touch upon the question of the future fortunes of any of you Scapegraces, without getting an impudent reply for oneâ\\x80\\x99s pains.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I did not mean to be impudent,â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick, penitently. â\\x80\\x9c Of course not, my dear sir,â\\x80\\x9d answered the other ; â\\x80\\x9c I know you didnâ\\x80\\x99t. You are impudent by natural consti 172 tution. You can no more prevent it, than you can pre 172 vent your hair curling, or your nose turning up. I suppose, too, you have been a good deal bullied already about what is to become of you ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ah, I just have,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick, with a deep-drawn216 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, sigh. â\\x80\\x9c I remember that Maria used to tell me that 1 would never get salt to my porridge, to encourage me to set about it, I suppose, when I was so young that I did not know what porridge meant ; then Adolphus was always impressing upon me that if I lived to he a hundred, I should never make anything of business, and at the same time pitching into me for not making some 172 thing bf it ; while, as for Uncle Ingramâ\\x80\\x940 lor, the things I have had said to me about what I was to be, and what I was not to be, they make me perspire to think of them.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I know,â\\x80\\x9d returned the philosopher, nodding ; â\\x80\\x9c and there was â\\x80\\x98 an old friend of your fatherâ\\x80\\x99s,â\\x80\\x99 or two, was nâ\\x80\\x99t there, who remembered you when you were â\\x80\\x98 so high,â\\x80\\x99 and prophesied that you would never grow up to be such a man as he? They asked you what you were going to be, didnâ\\x80\\x99t they, as though you were a chrysalis about to astonish them by some extraordinary transfor 172 mation ; and when you said you didnâ\\x80\\x99t know, remarked it was high time you did ; and when you did know, and told them, they objected to it? The friends of oneâ\\x80\\x99s father are oppressive. There ought to be a funeral pyre upon which the whole of his contemporaries should be sacrificed, on his demise without distinction of sex or age ; indeed, I think the women are the worst.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c They are,â\\x80\\x9d returned the young gentleman, not with 172 out a shudder of reminiscenceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c they are, and no mis 172 take.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c And why wonâ\\x80\\x99t you be a sailor, Dick, eh ? What, you are blushing ! You must certainly have some rea-THE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 217 son of which you ought by no means to be ashamed. The Scapegrace never blushes, so far as I have observed, unless when in the act of being influenced by some good motive.â\\x80\\x9d The lad blushed more than ever, as he replied, that his mother had once obtained a promise from himâ\\x80\\x94he did not know with what intention, hut it was upon the Sunday before he came up to London for the first time â\\x80\\x94that he would never, under any circumstances, go to sea. The philosopher patted the young manâ\\x80\\x99s head ap 172 provingly. â\\x80\\x9c A dead motherâ\\x80\\x99s wish is the best of rea 172 sons, lad,â\\x80\\x9d observed he. â\\x80\\x9cYou must, however, set your hand to something or other ; since you are not in that position of life wherein people enjoy the reputation of being able to do anything you choose without doing it ; and besides, there is the vulgar necessity of getting food. Ah, Dick, Dick, what a shiver that was ! Was the remark I made too coarse a one then ? Did it hint, ever so remotely, that you had not a shilling of your own, and were living at another manâ\\x80\\x99s cost? How strange it is that Providence should have given so much of the Sensitive Plant to natures that have far more need of the Prickly Cactus ! Is there, then, no more active line of life adapted for you than that of sitting to a pho 172 tographer ? The professions are out of your reach ; the trades disgust you ; what think you, then, of the pen ? Can you write, my Eichard ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c 0 yes,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick, briskly ; â\\x80\\x9c I can write a very tolerable hand, and even do flourishes with a steel pen L218 RICHARD arbour; or, â\\x80\\x94swans, and all thatâ\\x80\\x94but I canâ\\x80\\x99t say much for my spelling.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I was referring to authorship,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. William Mickleham, involuntarily setting hack his hair from his classical forehead. â\\x80\\x9cThere is little or no demand for poetry of a high order in the present day, but prose, I understand, gets its value, or at least its price. I should think you might try your hand with some prospect of success at the ephemâ\\x80\\x94that is to say the Sparkling Style, which is now so universally popular. They say, it is true, that a good many of the descriptive pieces are turned off by machinery with the same pattern woven in, but they can scarcely have dispensed altogether with brain-work, either. I think rather that that school of writers must have discovered some ingenious adaptation of natural means whereby they produce their extraordi 172 nary results. I am not sure but that before describing any plan or object, they invert themselves, and in that position imbibe some effervescent mixture. You can stand on your head, my boy, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure. Well, when you next have a leisure twenty minutes, do it ; then take one of my .Seidlitz-powders yonder, and express your ideas in writing of the tool-house at the end of the back- garden. It will not be very accurate, but it will be lively, and just like enough for many persons to discern what is intended, whereby their self-complacency will be aroused and flatteredâ\\x80\\x94which, for all I know, is the object of the sparkling writer, and explains his popula 172 rity. What ! you donâ\\x80\\x99t think you could overcome the physical difficulties ? Why, there are authors of twentyTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 219 yearsâ\\x80\\x99 standingâ\\x80\\x94standing on their heads, I meanâ\\x80\\x94who (apparently) suffer from it not the slightest inconve 172 nience. At your age, such an admission is serious in 172 deed. You must he bilious, Dick. In that case, the Bilious School will he just the thing for you. Its dis 172 ciples are moody, witheringly sarcastic, and suspicious to an excessive degree. According to these, the most frightful tragedies are in the course of being enacted in every family, quite unknown to the Detective Police. We all wish each other dead, or, at the best, donâ\\x80\\x99t care about the matter either way. Oneâ\\x80\\x99s wife is in love with her music-master, and over the piano the pair interchange the most dangerous sentiments in Italian, a language we know nothing about ; the money which our dead father liad especially laid aside for our instruction in that tongue having been dissipated by his widow in the tra 172 velling expenses of her second honeymoon. There is also the Mutual Improvement Schoolâ\\x80\\x94all serious con 172 descension and personal advice, with intimate relations established with the reader whether he will or noâ\\x80\\x94which 1 will not insult you by recommending to your notice.â\\x80\\x9d Thus, half in banter, half in earnest, did Mr.William Mickleham suggest this and that line of life to the im 172 practicable youth, without any very great faith in his own recommendations. lie concluded, rightly, that this was a case where that oyster the world must be opened after the operatorâ\\x80\\x99s own manner, and with what instrument he would, and for the present, Mr. William Mickleham, like his father and sister, had fallen back upon vague anticipations of good resulting to the lad from the inter-220 EICHAED AEBOUE ; OE, view lie needs must have with his uncle at the funeral of Mrs. Arbour. He was therefore disappointed scarcely less than they when he learned how that interview liad terminated. The Â£600, which was forwarded to Dick by Mr. Ingram Arbour on the following day, he could not be persuaded to make use of, and it was suffered to lie in his name at his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s bankers, where the old gentleman liad placed it. There came, too, an affectionate letter from Maggie, assuring him of her well-being, and representing herself on the same footing with her uncle as before, except that lie would not permit Richardâ\\x80\\x99s name to be mentioned. â\\x80\\x9c You may stay with me, Niece Margaret, so long as I live, as usual,â\\x80\\x9d he had said, â\\x80\\x9c but when I die, you will find that my oath of disinheritance has been kept to the letter.â\\x80\\x9d The girl, however, did not write that latter part of his determination to her brother. She was not only one who was careful for others rather than for herself, but of that still rarer sortâ\\x80\\x94and rarest in the female sex perhapsâ\\x80\\x94who are not solicitous to be known as sufferers even by the being in whose cause they have sacrificed themselves. All she stipulated for, was that whatever course Dick decided upon, he would let her know it ; and so concluded with her prayerful wishes for his good. There was a postscript, howeverâ\\x80\\x94for Maggie was woman as well as angelâ\\x80\\x94which alarmed the lad not a little. â\\x80\\x9c I do not come to you as I long to do, since it would only enrage my uncle ; you, I am sure, would be the very last person to desire to expose others to his wrath, whose only crime is their tenderness for you.â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 221 Mr. Mickleham had been in unusually low spirits that afternoon, so that Dick did not like to speak of any annoying subject in his presence ; but as soon as that gentleman was enjoying his customary nap after dinner, and he found himself alone with Mr. William, he deter 172 mined to make a confidant of that gentleman, of whose sagacity lie had formed a high opinion, and get that same uncomfortable postscript of Sister Maggieâ\\x80\\x99s explained. â\\x80\\x9c Well,â\\x80\\x9d observed his mentor, when he had perused the letter, â\\x80\\x9c I have never had the pleasure of seeing Miss Margaret Arbour, and rather mistrust one young lady\\'s ecstasies about the virtues of another ; hut I now believe that all the good I have heard of her from my sister falls short of her real merits.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cShe is the very greatest brick,â\\x80\\x9d observed Dick, enthusiastically, and with his cheeks glowing as they always did when his theme was Maggieâ\\x80\\x99s virtues ; â\\x80\\x9c she never mentions herself, you see, nor hints at the loss to which she has subjected herself on my account. She even triesâ\\x80\\x94God bless herâ\\x80\\x94to make it appear that her uncle has forgiven her, though I know the old â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Never mind,â\\x80\\x9d interpolated the philosopher, â\\x80\\x9c you may omit the adjectives.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell, I know him a precious deal too well to think that possible,â\\x80\\x9d continued Dick ; â\\x80\\x9cit is for that very reason that I am so puzzled about this postscript, Mr. William. She is not afraid on her own account, of course ; who, then, are these others whom she warns me not to expose to my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s anger ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps Mr. Ingram Arbour is about to impeach222 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OK, the magistrate, who directed the inspector, who ordered the peeler, who called a cab, and thereby effected your discharge from custody. These vindictive uncles will run through the whole House that Jack built in revenge upon every portion of it that has chanced to stand between them and their victim. I have known it to occur my 172 self a hundred timesâ\\x80\\x94upon the stage. It is, without doubt, the magistrate of Poplar who is going to catch it.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c You are sure, sir,â\\x80\\x9d inquired the boy appealingly, â\\x80\\x9c that nothing within your own knowledge has taken place between Yes, I see there has 0 Mr. William, pray, do not deceive me. Has your dear father, my kind friend, suffered any annoyance from my uncle upon my account ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Well, Dick, the fact is, I think there has been a sort of a row in Darkendim Street to-day. Your brother, I fancy, indulged in some strongish language about har 172 bouring ruffians in defiance of the express wishes of the head of the firm ; and, you see, my father is a commercial manâ\\x80\\x94in short, heâ\\x80\\x99s been a good deal more cut up about it than I should have been ; but he would be angry enough, mind you, if he thought that I had whispered it to you. I dare say Mr. Adolphus told your sister what pleasant things he was about to say, as junior partnerâ\\x80\\x94 for he has been taken into the firm, I hearâ\\x80\\x94to the managing clerk ; and she means to put you on your guard lest you should unwittingly hurt us. But, bless your heart, we are not so easily hurt, Dick ; and you shall not be turned out of our house to please Twangfo himself, â\\x80¢\\'-the offspring of the sun and moon, and first-cousin to theTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 223 planetary system, and far less for any pigheaded young china-merchant, such as Mr. Adolphus Arbour.â\\x80\\x9d Dick could not trust himself to speak, hut gratefully wringing the philosopherâ\\x80\\x99s hand, rushed up into his own chamber, and locked the door. His conscience reproached him more bitterly than it had ever done, save when his mother lay a-dyingâ\\x80\\x94in that he had given no thought to the possibility of what he had just been told, but had been so ready to say all was well, so long as he was enjoying present ease. He determined that that day should be the last on which he would run the chance of bringing down the lightning of his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s wrath upon any human being, even though he should have to beg his bread through the world. He would not even risk a call upon good Mrs. Trimming for the loan she had offered. But what, by the by, was that letter which she had given him from her son, and which had lain unopened until now in the coat-pocket whither his haste had thrust it on leaving his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s house ? He took it out with some vague hope of help, and as he read it, his clouded face began to brighten, and his eyes to dance as the eyes of the poor man will at the sight of a five-pound note, so long as the Bank of England standeth. There was good news besides the note, too, upon that rather dingy piece of paper, and in that other than fashionable female hand. â\\x80\\x9c Bless her kind heart,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Dick, kissing the soiled and vulgar sheet of paper, which was not from Mr. Jones at all, except the superscription ; and then, as though the action had reminded the young dog of who was in the back-garden, he ran down towards that arbour which224 EICHAED AEBOUK ; OR, Mr. William Micklehamâ\\x80\\x94with that offensive deprecia 172 tion of things pertaining to himself which is the affecta 172 tion of other philosophersâ\\x80\\x94would persist in calling a tool-house. A tool-house ! Say rather a bower of roses by Bendermereâ\\x80\\x99s stream ; or the pleasure-house in Xanadu â\\x80\\x94although it was Kensingtonâ\\x80\\x94where Alph the sacred river ran, through caverns measureless to man ; for did not Lucy Mickleham take her Berlin-work there upon summer evenings, and the pure stream of Dickâ\\x80\\x99s first love flow round it fathomless !THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 225 CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIRST. OUT OF TOWN. At seventeen, and with a five-pound note in oneâ\\x80\\x99s pocket, who is there that needs â\\x80\\x9cto call the Lord Mayor his uncle ?â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94an expression, ladies, borrowed from the clas 172 sics of the lower classes, and signifying, generally, the advantages of any high social connection. With elastic youth upon our side, and so much money as puts the immediate future out of base consideration, whom, in 172 deed, need we envy ? Not the hoary duke, whose span of existence even our five pounds discreetly expended may see the end of, and whose manner of lifeâ\\x80\\x94if we may believe the popular novelistâ\\x80\\x94has not been such as to afford him entire serenity in its contemplation. Nay, scarcely any old gentleman, we may say, in any how 172 ever eminent social position, hut would he glad to change places with us, and barter all his honours and riches for the privilege granted to Hezekiah of old. Remem 172 ber that, 0 unfriended weary young tramp, plodding with scanty wallet upon Lifeâ\\x80\\x99s crowded highway, and may it he a comfort to your murmuring spirit. The third of those who recline in the splendid chariots whose226 EICHAKD abboue; oe, wheels cover you with dust, are by no means to he envied ; nay, not even he in the bishopâ\\x80\\x99s coach yonder, who has worn his purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day, since that vicarious hour when he married the dangerous girl betrothed to his patronâ\\x80\\x99s heir, and left his own sorrowing Katie to wear the willow. It is possible that poverty-stricken Youth does com 172 fort itself in this fashion, and it is certainly observable that it does not promote or lead revolutions (as one might well expect it to do) in the same proportion as unprosperous Middleageâ\\x80\\x94that period which despises both the hopes of the Young and the regrets of the Old, and estimates to an extreme degree mere loaves and fishes. It was probably most excellent natural spirits, how 172 ever, rather than the above reflections, which made Eichard Arbour whistle and sing so blithely as he trod the leafy lanes of Devonshire, on the third day from that on which we parted from him at Kensington. He had during that interview in the arbour prepared Miss Lucyâ\\x80\\x99s mind for his immediate departure, setting forth the positive necessity of it so vividly, as to silence all her eloquent love-battery except a sigh or two. He did not confide to her the precise nature of the employment he had in view, nor was her trustful nature solicitous to discover what he whom she loved would fain conceal ; nor did he reveal it more.particularly to her brother, or to Maggie, with both of whom he communicated by letter, after he had left London. By letter, too, he had ex-THE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 227 pressed his profound gratitude to Mr. Mickleham, and the hopes which he entertained of getting an honest livelihood, and of not shaming his generous protector by any future conduct ; and by letter he had informed Lucidora that her advice in case of the worst had been followed, and that he accepted her five pounds with the most heartfelt thanks, as a loan which he trusted would be but temporary. Having thus performed his literary dutiesâ\\x80\\x94which were always somewhat irksome to himâ\\x80\\x94and set himself right with all his friendsâ\\x80\\x94which was a novel as well as satisfactory position to find himself inâ\\x80\\x94Dick had travel 172 led along merrily by coach and railway to within a little of the town of Salterlcigh in North Devon, which he was now approaching on foot. The noontide light fell green and golden through the shadowing branches that almost met above his head, and lit up the red sandstone banks that walled him in on either side. Walking amid a rainbow of colours that seemed rather to belong to the air than earth, and conscious of the unseen summer influences in his heart and brain, it was no wonder that he thought of Darkendim Street, and its smell of mouldy straw, with a sort of pleasant scorn. There is no man so closely wedded to Town, but that on some days in every year he acknowledges to himself that his marriage was one of convenience, and that the Country is his true and natural consort, after all. To the Young especially, just emancipated from the din and toil of a city life, a day among green fields is the Eevival Epoch of the earliest and freshest aspirations, when Nature once more228 RICHARD ARBOUK ; OR, makes us that offer of communionâ\\x80\\x94faint though it he grown with much rejectionâ\\x80\\x94which she pressed upon us when we were lads and lasses long ago. Dickâ\\x80\\x99s step had an elasticity which it had never felt on the road from Golden Square to the city, although he had already walked five times that distance, and the young blood leaped in his veins like sparkling wine. Presently the laneâ\\x80\\x94which was a wide enough road, howeverâ\\x80\\x94seemed to end abruptly, and to lead to the verge of a hlood-red cliff beneath which lay the gleam 172 ing sea. Dick had seen blue glimpses of the ocean, here and there, before, for his way had lain along a range of elevated moorland for miles by coach, hut this sudden revelation of the great deep, literally at his very feet, almost took his breath away with admiration. He had beheld the Tower of London and St. Paulâ\\x80\\x99s without ex 172 periencing those tremendous sensations, which had been expected of him by Mr. Mickleham, (who had taken him thither when he first came up to town), and had regarded even the commerce-hearing Thames with its crowded Pool with considerable equanimity ; but the scene now before him affected him to an extreme degree. He sat down upon the lane-side, and taking his knapsack from his hack, drank in the gorgeous vision with that thirst which more lads feel for the sights of nature than dare to own it ; for even in youth we soon learn to hold it weakness to he subject to impressions produced merely by the works of the Creator, as having little or no prac 172 tical hearing. The long broken line of gray which marked the opposite coast had indescribable charms forTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 229 Dick ; it might he Wales upon the map perhaps, hut to him it was Fairyland. The stately vessels, so far off, that, notwithstanding their white wings, they appeared motionless, were floating mysteries ; the steamships, whose black pennants trailing tlirough the sky pro 172 claimed their course, outward or homeward hound, had each for him its story. The hues of earth, and sea, and sky had changed, the noonday insect monotone had ceased, the air came cooler from the stream close by, which ever hurried oâ\\x80\\x99er the cliff to meet the sea, when Dick took up his worldly goods again, and pursued his way once more ; for the road did really turn, though almost at right angles, a few yards short of the precipice, and immediately at the foot of the winding hill lay Salterleigh. It was a large vil 172 lage, hid in a beautiful ravine, apparently closed up to eastward by a thick wood, amid which could be seen a stream of silver, which was the waterfall for which the spot was famous ; southward, however, another hill, as steep as that which Dick was descending, afforded egress, in the strange case of any one wishing to quit so fair a residence ; and westward was the one broad street that led to the harbour and the little pier. As the lad neared the high gray bridge which crossed the ravine, and gave access to the town, a mighty red and yellow placard, stuck on a fallen oak tree, like a vulgar libel on a dead heroâ\\x80\\x99s fame, arrested his attention.230 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, Stupendous Attraction ! !

There was one old man, however,\"looking out of a window in the High Street, horizontally, so as to convey the idea of his being in bed at the same timeâ\\x80\\x94which indeed he wasâ\\x80\\x94 who informed the stranger that everybody was away to see the Beasteses, and that he himself, the speaker, could from his present elevated position catch a sight of the pictures in front of the principal caravan.232 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, Following the direction of the eyes of this enthusiast, Dick presently came upon the only level spot which Salterleigh could boast of, situated in a romantic hollow of the gorge, usually dedicated to cricket, once a year to the wrestling which formed the principal attractions of the village fair, and on this particular dayâ\\x80\\x94unexampled in Salterleigh annalsâ\\x80\\x94to the menagerie aforesaid, whose twenty gigantic caravans, arranged in an oblong, and covered over with tarpaulin, presented a material Para 172 dise to so much of the population as could not raise the shilling demanded for admittance. These unhappy per 172 sons, some threescore in number, had been standing in front of the gigantic picture and the little flight of steps â\\x80\\x94that was a Jacobâ\\x80\\x99s ladder to them, upon which a more favoured race ascended and descendedâ\\x80\\x94from noon to eve, and even now evinced no signs of weariness. Besides the barest possibilities of good fortuneâ\\x80\\x94such as that of some caravan more top-heavy than its fellows falling side 172 ways, and so revealing some hid treasure of natural his 172 tory ; or that more hopeless chance of the vinegar-faced woman, who sat in the shrine upon the platform, beckon 172 ing them up into the sacred place gratuitously, out of mere good natureâ\\x80\\x94there was enough even outside the show to repay any reasonable expectations. There were, in the first place, to be seen no less than thirteen beefeaters, and royal beefeaters, too, unless faith is to be denied to golden letters encircling black velvet capsâ\\x80\\x94and in that case, where is Scepticism to cry halt ? Each of these persons had some mighty instru 172 ment of music, constructed, as it seemed, out of the trunksTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 233 of golden elephants, cunningly fitting one into the other, and producing in combination a volume of sound which might well he designated imperial quarto. Once every two hours, these gorgeous persons took outside places upon the stage, and discoursed much eloquent wind- music ; they were accustomed so to do in thickly popu 172 lated cities, and were apparently unaware that they had long ago attracted every inhabitant of Salterleigh. Now and then, too, a stout and melancholy-looking gentleman, with a massive watchguard, who was rightly whispered to be the great Tredgold himself, would come to the front, and exclaim, in a sonorous voice : â\\x80\\x9c Walk up, ladies and gentlemenâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94at which the threescore would most pas 172 sionately cheerâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80¢â\\x80\\x9c and inspect the greatest wonder of the age. This is the only opportunity which will be afforded in this town, in consequence of the pressure of engage 172 ments, and on account of her Majesty Queen Victoria having bespoke the exhibition at Windsor Castle for the 14th of next month.â\\x80\\x9d Then he would converse with the vinegar-faced woman in the shrine, as to the advisability, it was fondly conjectured, of lowering the price of admit 172 tance, for it was observed that she always shook her head malevolently, and nothing came of it. Lastly there were sounds to be heard, nay sights to be seen, even by the outsiders, in connection with the animals themselves. The camelâ\\x80\\x94or so said the village schoolmasterâ\\x80\\x99s son, who ought to know, if anybody did â\\x80\\x94was heard to sneeze distinctly, and the elephantâ\\x80\\x94 the same authority settled itâ\\x80\\x94to trumpet ; although there were certain ignorant and stubborn persons who l 2231) EICHAED Ã\\x80EBOUE; OE, held this latter noise to he only Mr. Tredgold yawning. That gentleman did yawn pretty loudly, it must he con 172 fessed, as the evening drew on, and he still heheld the same patient hand standing in front of his own, and not â\\x80\\x98\\'walking up â\\x80\\x9d with a single shilling. The striped legs of the female hyena had been caught sight ofâ\\x80\\x94rather in 172 delicatelyâ\\x80\\x94hy one fortunate outsider through a cranny, which -had instantly been stopped up from within on his indiscreetly expressing his gratification ; and one of the workhouse lads protested that he had heheld the jackal peering round the corner of the platform itself : upon cross-examination, however, this testimony broke down, the witness confessing that he was not prepared to swear it was not a specimen of the canis communis after allâ\\x80\\x94 the village clergymanâ\\x80\\x99s own dog, which with a rash reliance upon its masterâ\\x80\\x99s sacred character, had accom 172 panied him into the show, from which it subsequently emerged howling, and leaving a quarter of an inch of its curly tail in the possession of the racoon. Dick elbowed his way through this shillingless crowd, whom he sincerely pitied, and ascended the steps amid a tempest of welcome from the band. The vinegar-faced woman smiled acidly upon him from her shrine, as saints both in and out of niches sometimes do, and her skinny hand closed like a snap-purse upon the expected coin. Dick hesitated a moment, doubtful as to whether it would be better to enter as a spectator and make his observa 172 tions in that unprejudiced character, or to make known his desire of joining the company at once ; Mrs. Tredgold however, upon whose practical mind the ladâ\\x80\\x99s dustyTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 235 clothes and scanty knapsack had in a few seconds made their impression, decided this matter for him by calling ont: â\\x80\\x9cNow young man, be alive, if you please, and donâ\\x80\\x99t percent the nobility and gentry obtaining haccess to the hexhibition.â\\x80\\x9d Nature had given to this lady a voice sufficiently shrill, but she generally intensified it by speaking over the edge of a small key, belonging to the cash-box, and held up to her withered lips whenever she was perform 172 ing her pecuniary duties upon the platform. Her tone did not strike Dick as betokening a propitious frame of mind for welcoming an addition to the staff, and there 172 fore he walked on and into the show without reply.236 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SECOND. A LECTURE UPON NATURAL HISTORY. The menagerie of Tredgold, late Trimming was realty a fine collection of animals in good condition, and some 172 thing very different from those melancholy exhibitions made up of a few mangy camels and shuffling elephants which was all the natural history that travelled in the days of our fathers. There were eight caravans on either side the oblong, and a couple at both ends. Some of these were divided into two, three, or even four compartments; the female Hyena, for instance (whose legs had been so shamefully espied), occupying the ground floorâ\\x80\\x94which, however, was, of course, the height of the caravan-wheel from the groundâ\\x80\\x94and the Jackal the floor above ; and a rather trying overhead lodger he must have been, in case that lady was nervous ; for he spent the whole of his days and most of his nights in pacing to and fro like a sea-captain ; and that not only upon the floor of his scanty chamber, but half way up the walls thereofâ\\x80\\x94either through not being able to stop himself (for he was always in a state of great impetuosity, and as though he had just recollected some very par-THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 237 ticular appointment which must be kept immediately), or from some other reason known only to Buffon and his own mind. On the second floor resided a Badger of an evil odour, who, being very much ashamed of him 172 self, as he well might be, was always endeavouring to conceal his person from the public eye in a very in 172 sufficient quantity of straw. It was a painful position for any animal, aggravated in his particular case by the conduct of a couple of wild cats in the attics or third floor, who never ceased to express their disapprobation by hissing and pretending to expectorate. On the other hand, the next compartment was what is called in Edinburgh, a self-contained houseâ\\x80\\x94without flatsâ\\x80\\x94the whole of which was in the occupation of a Bhinoceros, whose horn had been exalted in a manner totally uncon 172 nected with the Eastern metaphor ; for, having moulted or dropped off, or been knocked off the animalâ\\x80\\x99s nose (which retained merely a small knob, as if to mark the locality of the missing ornament), it was hung up on the top bars of his cage, to the wonder of the public, and the distress (as is but too probable) of its original possessor. Mental anxiety of some sort was at all events depicted upon his leathery countenance; while his hide bore unmistakeable testimony, in its superfluous folds and excrescences, that it had been made for him to order (unless it was procured at second hand, which seems unlikely) at a period when he was a fatter and more prosperous beast. By the time Dickâ\\x80\\x99s observations had extended thus far, the sagacious elephant Ninus (so called from there238 RICHARD arbour; or, having been eight elephants before him under the Tred- gold dynasty, of whom two yet remained) rang a mighty bell with his trunk, and the chief exhibitor exhorted the spectators to follow him round the establishment, and listen to his illustrated treatise upon the brute creation. The Salterleigh audience, who had done this five times alreadyâ\\x80\\x94for each of the performances was repeated every hour, with the view of edifying the fresh arrivals that were supposed to he pouring into the exhibition momentlyâ\\x80\\x94obeyed the summons with an alacrity which must have been gratifying indeed, one would have thought, to the feelings of any lecturer ; but the gentle 172 man in question, who had sent round his hat after the last four performances with its little appeal to the generosity of the public entirely unresponded to, took up his pole of reference as though it had been a pilgrimâ\\x80\\x99s staff, and as if he could willingly have delegated the privilege of dilating upon the affairs of the animal world to anybody else. His quick eye lit upon the only new face among the staring eyes and expanding mouths of his listeners, and to Dick he principally addressed his remarks, as to one who knew how to recompense as well as to appreciate instruction. â\\x80\\x9c Of all the pursuits calculated to ennoble and refine the human mind, that of the study of natural history, when accompanied by living specimens, it has been agreed upon all hands, is the most advantageous ; this is full of wonderful and interesting phenomenonsâ\\x80\\x94such as what they will touch, and what they will not touch, in the way of food, who are their natural enemies, howTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 233 obedient they are to the eye of man (in this exhibition, entirely unassisted by the whip), and so on, from the gigantic elephant, three beautiful specimens of which are now before us, down to the ridiculus mus, or dor 172 mouse, so familiar to those around me, and doubtless kept in a lozenge box, or other warm receptacle, by many of them in their early childhood. Mnus, acquaint this gentleman with the knapsack, who is perhaps an artist, and wishes to take your picture, that you are very glad to see him. What! you wonâ\\x80\\x99t say a word, my friend ! That is very rude. You are glad to see him, I hope, at all events.â\\x80\\x9d Nmus being thus invoked, emitted a most awful sound, the reverberation whereof it doubtless was that had so gratified the outdoor spectators, and which Mr. Mopes (the exhibitor) explained was the affirmative of the animalâ\\x80\\x94the elephantine â\\x80\\x9c Yes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd you donâ\\x80\\x99t want him to go away again just yet,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, â\\x80\\x9c not till he has heard the lecture, and seen the Earthman and the Earthwoman, and beheld the lion-hunt conducted by the Invincible Tickero- candua?â\\x80\\x9d Mnus being again called upon to reply, and feeling, as many other great personages feel in presence of the public, that he had no observation to make beyond that to which he had already given utterance, repeated the same. â\\x80\\x9c That is well, Mnus,â\\x80\\x9d observed the exhibitor with hardihood. He now says â\\x80\\x9c No,â\\x80\\x9d you see ; he does not want this young gentleman to go away. Give him a240 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, cake, Jeeheeboy, and mind (whispered he to the atten 172 dant black) itâ\\x80\\x99s one of the cayenne pepper ones ; the haggeravating brute !â\\x80\\x94Cakes and nuts, gentlemen, may be procured, as stated in the bills, of his keeper only, which he will pick up with his trunk, or having opened his mouth at the word of command Young man,â\\x80\\x9d observed the lecturer, suddenly interrupting himself, and addressing one of the more youthful of his hearers, â\\x80\\x9c do nâ\\x80\\x99t let me see you a-doing that again, or you leave this exhibition directly minute ; and I recommend you not to get into the way of that â\\x80\\x99ere elephant, neither, any time this ten years. Hoysters indeed ! A pretty thing to be offering an hoyster to a poor animal like that, who has not got even fingers to open it. Eespect other per 172 sonsâ\\x80\\x99 tastes, sir. How would you like half-a-dozen aber- nethies, and two quarts of nuts, with their shells on, chucked down your throat, I wonder? And Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure youâ\\x80\\x99re opening yoar mouth wide enough, anyway.â\\x80\\x94The elephant, gentlemen and ladies, is sometimes called the whale of terra firma, and, indeed, he can exist for a con 172 siderable period under water by means of his trunk, which he elevates above the surface, as in the ordinary diving-bell ; when the stream is not deep enough for total immersion, the ingenious animal converts this member into a garden-engine, and cools his body by spouting upon it volumes of water. These animals were made use of by Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, in his wars against the Eomans ; and that monarch had so high an opinion of their docility and right feeling, that he was on one occasion heard to observe that it was easier toTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 241 turn the sun from its course, than any of those from the path of honour. The mahout, or elephant-driver, in India is armed with a steel weapon, which, being driven with considerable violence into its neck, the sagacious beast will immediately quicken its pace. Ninus and his two consortsâ\\x80\\x94polygamy being permitted among this gigantic raceâ\\x80\\x94will presently go through the singular and interesting performance of standing on their own heads, and placing themselves in other classical attitudes.â\\x80\\x9d Through the whole of this eulogium, the three ele 172 phants kept nodding their heads, as though in the gravest corroboration, and officiously presenting their trunks to each of the company (to the manifest perturbation of the Devonshire mind), as though they were touting with invisible cards for some advertising establishment. â\\x80\\x9c The Nylghau,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Mopes, addressing his remarks to the animal so designated, who seemed to have been unable to make up his mind whether he should be an ox or an ass, and to have been punished for the indecision pretty severely by having had the hump of the dromedary clapped upon himâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c is one of the most vicious of the natives of India. When meditat 172 ing an attack, this insidious quadruped will fall upon his knees in a devotional attitude, shuffle on obsequiously a few paces, and then darting forward with a powerful spring, rarely fails to annihilate the astonished spectator. â\\x80\\x9c The CÃ¢mÃ¨lÃ«opÃ¢rd and her young. This quadruped has justly been called the gentlest of animals, as well as being by far the tallest and most useless. The young one before you, which has only been ushered into the242 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, world a few days ago, is upwards of nine feet high, without which bountiful provision of nature in respect to altitude, he would he unable to partake of that re 172 freshment which his tender age demands. His amble is very peculiar, and may he likened to the knightâ\\x80\\x99s move in chess, or the spectacle which might he afforded by a camp-stool in active motion. This creature commonly culls its food from the upper branches of tall trees, thus interfering with the requirements of no other animal ; when reduced to crop the herbage of the ground, it has to set its forelegs exceedingly wide apart, in order to bring its mouth sufficiently low ; and from that absurd position it surveys the landscapeâ\\x80\\x94being gifted with the attribute of looking backwardsâ\\x80\\x94from between its own liind-legs. When erect, it can, on any moderately level ground, observe the approach of an enemy from the other side, or nearly so, of the horizon, and can then make offâ\\x80\\x94though unfortunately only up hillâ\\x80\\x94at con 172 siderable speed. â\\x80\\x9cThe Llama, which is sometimes designated the Camel of the East, in consequence of its being able to go for a lengthened period without waterâ\\x80\\x94and, of course, all other liquid refreshmentsâ\\x80\\x94is good to eat, and also excellent for paletots or overcoats. Too easily attracted by curiosity, alas, the hunter has only to lie on his back, with his heels in. the air, and these confiding creatures will flock round him, as the hoys of our country will surround a street exhibition ; when even the discharge of his fatal weapon is considered (by the survivors) to form a part of the interesting performance. They areTHE- FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 243 extensively used by the Peruvians as beasts of burden ; but from the circumstance of their being very weak, excessively slow, and obstinate beyond belief by persons who have been only accustomed to mules, there is little probability of their superseding the horse amongst our 172 selves. The Llama is a native of South America, but it is occasionally found in Tibet, where it is held in the greatest veneration, and even worshipâ\\x80\\x94probably on account of its rarity.â\\x80\\x9d It was a characteristic of Mr. Mopesâ\\x80\\x99 lectures, which Dick, of course, did not get acquainted with till after 172 wards, that on days when the company were numerous, and their donations liberal, his accounts of the animals he described were eulogistic, and even flattering ; whereas on unsatisfactory occasions, such as the present, when Mr. Mopesâ\\x80\\x99 mind was soured by a lack of appreciation, they were detractory and calumnious. â\\x80\\x9c The Brown Bear, in common with the rest of his species, has the power of sitting, and even walking, in an erect position, as well as that of climbing trees ; but he does nâ\\x80\\x99t do any of it well. It is said that he will not attack a person sleeping ; but this, I think, from what I know of him, must mean when the bear is sleeping, and not the man. He is a fierce and remorseless animal, and we keepers who have to venture into his compart 172 ment risk our lives for a comparatively trifling considera 172 tion. Observe his claws, gentlemen and ladies, and how he stuffs his fore-paws into his mouth, as though for want of a human sacrifice. It looks like toothache, but itâ\\x80\\x99s nothing of that sort, I do assure you.214 richard arbour ; or, â\\x80\\x9c This animal, with the partially shaved countenance, and the inadequate white shirt, is the Guereza Monkey, a native of Africa, the climate of which can alone excuse such insufficiency of clothing. From the bush-like ter 172 mination of its tail, which commonly forms its cushion, combined with the contemplative expression of its coun 172 tenance, it is sometimes confused with the fabled Rum- tumfoozleum, so familiar to many of my hearers as the animal who â\\x80\\x98 sits upon the tip of his tail a-wondering at the ordinances of nature but this is not the case.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Mopesâ\\x80\\x99 harangue became wearisome enough to Dick by this time, who, from much acquaintance with the Zoological Gardens, knew almost as much about the subject as did the lecturer ; but he was too astute a lad to disgust one who would probably be his future com 172 panion, by exhibiting the indifference he really felt. He therefore accompanied him in his tour round the four quarters of the globe, and his researches into earth and sky with laudable attention, laughing only when Mr. Mopes laughed, which was seldom, and not during the delivery of his more eloquent passages, where the fun was not so obvious to the narrator as to his hearersâ\\x80\\x94a rule that it is well to observe at lectures of a more scientific character. The most interesting of all the animals in Dickâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, although those about which Mr. Mopes had least to say, were the lions and tigers, who occupied three contiguous densâ\\x80\\x94the lions by themselves, the tigers by themselves, and in the third den a lion and a tigress together. What a contrast was there between the appearance of the kingTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 2Vo of beastsâ\\x80\\x94extended at full length, slumbrous and re 172 signed, but far from torpid, with his calm earnest eyes half open, conscious alike of strength and of captivityâ\\x80\\x94 and that of his fellow-prisoner, whose eye seemed to speak fire against every created creature, during that noiseless but impatient pacing to and fro, and whose awful throat to send forth from time to time the very name of the author of her woes, and the object on which her revengeful heart was broodingâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c Man, Man !â\\x80\\x9d With what care, too, despite her wrath, when her rapid stride led her across the lionâ\\x80\\x99s extended paws, did she pick her way, cautious not to offend the powerful ; and what a murderous sneer she wore at sight of the exhibitor, whose approach she awaited poised upon three legs, a monument of ferocious beauty, as though the hour of her deliverance was at last at hand, and he who was about to confer the benefit should be the first to rue it. â\\x80\\x9cDid Tickerocandua enter that very cage?â\\x80\\x9d was Dickâ\\x80\\x99s inquiry. â\\x80\\x9c Certainly,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr, Mopes ; â\\x80\\x9c leastways when there was any encouragement afforded by the spectators, he did so. Under present circumstances, which were humiliating to him as a Briton and a believer in the perfectibility of the human race, such a course was out of the question ; but even now the Lion-tamer of Central Africa would go through his astounding performances with the three lions and four lionesses in the neighbour 172 ing compartment, as advertised in the bills. Whether folks were real gentry, or merely rubbish, added Mr.246 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, Mopes, with meaning, â\\x80\\x9c word is always kept with the public in every case.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd does the Lion-hunter venture among those tigers by themselves?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Dick with interest, and pointing to that far from Happy Family of Felinw in question, who, ceaselessly winding in and out, and over and under one another, seemed to he treading some terrible tiger-measure to . a running accompaniment of snarls and growls. â\\x80\\x9cDoes he go in among them tender-hearted critturs ?â\\x80\\x9d echoed Mr. Mopes, with derisive scorn ; â\\x80\\x9c why, not if he knows it ; no.â\\x80\\x9d By which that gentleman did not mean to convey the impression that Tickerocandua ever visited them unconsciously, as in his sleep, hut that if he were so rash as to do such a thing at all, the perfor 172 mance would not be repeated. â\\x80\\x9c The Earthman and the Earthwoman will now make their appearance,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the lecturer ; and as he spoke, the pair alluded to descended a little ladder lead 172 ing from one of the two caravans occupied as dwelling- houses, and made their bows to the company. Little akin to humanity as this couple were, they illustrated the poetâ\\x80\\x99s statement, that â\\x80\\x9cMan wants but little here below, nor wants that little long,â\\x80\\x9d by their respective garments, which seemed to be entirely formed of strings of shells, and which, as they moved, made a pleasant tinkling like that of sheep-bells ; they could hardly have been put on, however, for a similar purpose, since the wearers were not of a character to become lost or indis 172 tinguishable among any amount of their fellow-ereatures.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. The Earthman and the Earthwoman had a certain (per 172 haps) earthy odour about them, which, independently of the shells, made you aware of their presence at a consi 172 derable distance : their hue was an unhealthy brown, relieved by red and yellow spots, wherewith they tattooed themselves precisely as the peripatetic cake-dealers of the humbler sort are wont to sprinkle their gingerbread. Round their waists and arms they v r ore German-silver rings of a mighty thickness, wRich gave them the appear 172 ance of having just been released from personal confine 172 ment, in order to go through their â\\x80\\x9c characteristic war- dance and the only vocabulary of v 7 hich they were possessed consisted, or seemed to do so, of two wordsâ\\x80\\x94 Woggadaboo, signifying â\\x80\\x9c How do you do ?â\\x80\\x9d and Wiggidy, which was Earthen for â\\x80\\x9c Thank you, sir.â\\x80\\x9d It is to be hoped, that as they were unable to speak the. English tongue, so were they mercifully debarred from understanding it when spoken by their exhibitor. â\\x80\\x9c This is the Earthman and the Earthwoman, gentlemen and ladies,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mr. Mopes, dexterously insinuat 172 ing, by emphasis, the immense difference that lay be 172 tween barbarism and civilization, â\\x80\\x9cand it is supposed that they are the lowest of created human beings. It has been conjectured by some that they are more akin to the ourangoutang, or wild man of the woods, whose acquaintance w r e have just been cultivating, than to the human ; but this is easily disproved by the inspection of the toes or fingers ; and, moreover, the interesting specimens now before us live where there are no woods, but in holes of the earth, after the manner of the rabbit248 KICHAKD ABBOUK OK, or cony, and hence their name. The taller one is, of course, the male, who is, however, kept under strict con 172 trol, and sometimes even beaten by the female, which, again, materially strengthens their position as being allied to the human family. They will perform their characteristic war-dance, accompanied by singing ; after which they will go round the company and wish them â\\x80\\x98good-by,â\\x80\\x99 by shaking hands, an accomplishment they have been recently taught with infinite pains and trou 172 ble : the mode of salutation among themselvesâ\\x80\\x94that of rubbing each otherâ\\x80\\x99s noses briskly together for several secondsâ\\x80\\x94having been found almost ineradicable.â\\x80\\x9d At the conclusion of this eulogium, the Earthman and Earthwoman began to jump about in their charac 172 teristic, but rather alarming manner, at the same time uttering a war-cry compounded of the words Woggada- boo and Wiggidy ; after which they pervaded the spec 172 tators, who pressed as eagerly forward for a clasp of their clammy hands as though they were monarclis (which, indeed, they were said to be, in Earthland), and touching for the kingâ\\x80\\x99s-evil. These ceremonies being ended, and the elephants having duly stood, according to the programme, â\\x80\\x9c upon their own headsâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94which, indeed, if they must needs stand on any, it was quite as well they should have doneâ\\x80\\x94and placed themselves in other â\\x80\\x9cclassical atti 172 tudes,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Mopes announced that â\\x80\\x9cthe performance would now conclude with the unique exhibition of Tickerocandua the Invincible, in his tremendous charac 172 ter of the Lion-hunter of Central Africa ; the only tamerTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 249 of the Monarch of the Forest now travelling, who could be relied upon with confidence for not having his head bitten off, or other unpleasant accident occurring, which but too often turned, what the public had expected to be a harmless exhibition, into a most distressing spec 172 tacle.â\\x80\\x94It was usual at this stage of the proceedings for those who were satisfied with the lecturer to bestow upon him some small pecuniary trifle, the amount of which was left to the ladies and gentlemen themselves.â\\x80\\x9d At these words, the attention of all Salterleigh be 172 came at once engrossed by things which had had no sort of previous interest for them ; such as the wood-work and bars of the caravans, the tarpaulin that roofed the exhibition, their clergymanâ\\x80\\x99s dog, and, in short, every object which they could admire without laying them 172 selves under an obligation to Mr. Mopes ; who, on his part, smiled sardonically, and inquired audibly of Dick, as he flipped that young gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s sixpence perpendi 172 cularly in air, whether he had ever seen such a heap of mean ones out of Devonshire. The question would have been rather an embarrassing one to answer without offence to either party ; but luckily, at that moment, Tickerocandua the Invincible was seen descending the ladder of the same caravan which had already sent forth the Earthman and his consort, and Mr. Mopes turned upon his heel, with the air of a monarch who feels indeed that the hour of deposition has arrived, but who, for his part, scorns to how his regal knee to the coming usurper.250 RICHAED ARBOUR; OR, CHAPTER THE TWENTY-THIRD. THE LION TAMER. The personal aspect of the Lion Tamer of Central Africa was certainly impressive in a very high degree. His actual height could scarcely have been less than six feet two, while it was artificially raised by a circlet of eagleâ\\x80\\x99s feathers set in a coronet, which the majority of enraptured beholders believed to be constructed of virgin gold. A leopard-skin, worn somewhat after the manner of a Scotch plaid, set off a jerkin of green leather, while his legs were encased in a pair of huge jack-hoots. Such was the costume in which Tickerocanduaâ\\x80\\x99s proprietors would have it supposed that he pursued the King of Beasts in the arid plains of his native land, armed only with an ordinary-looking carterâ\\x80\\x99s whip, which he carried, however, with an air as though it had been the sceptre of Timbuctoo. He was undeniably a magnifieent-looking fellow, to whom not even the luxuriant tresses which were swept hack from his forehead in the style Acrobatique, could impart a touch of effeminacy ; and as he trod the floor with abstracted air, he looked every inch as much a kingTHE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 251 as any playactor, and, it is probable, a vast deal more so tlian any actual occupant of a throne. Gazing neither to the right hand nor to the left, he gravely approached the cage where the lions were awaiting him, by no means as though he were an article of consumption, especially decorated for their table (as would have been my feeling, or yours, brave reader, in such a case), but rather as though he had â\\x80\\x9c a crow to pick,â\\x80\\x9d as the expression runs, with one of themâ\\x80\\x94an account which it distressed him as their ruler and natural protector to have to settle. In execution of this painful duty, therefore, as soon as he had deliberately opened the cage-door, just wide enough to admit himself, and bolted it on the inside, he applied his whip with considerable energy to that monarch of the desert, who happened to be making the greatest roaring of the seven ; then seizing him by a great handful of mane, he forced him to stand upon his hind legs, and rest his massive forepaws upon his own breast, in which position he stood for a minute or two, the lion looking straight into his face with the eye of an epicure regarding his first morsel, and Tickerocandua looking at the lion as though he would like to see him at it. Then disentangling himself of the King of Beasts by the simple process of throwing him backwards, he took up an exceedingly small wooden hoop, and re 172 quested, in ceremonious dumb show\\'â\\x80\\x94as though he were conferring the Order of the Garter upon some dis 172 tinguished courtierâ\\x80\\x94that the largest quadruped there present should leap through it without the previous precaution (which seemed absolutely necessary) of taking252 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, off his head and shoulders ; the thing appeared only one degree less preposterous than a request that the camel over the way should attempt the eye of a needle ; but at the second crack of the whip, and after a single groan of remonstrance from the lion, the creature darted through It, fitting it closely indeed as a bullet its barrel, but with all that shaggy amplitude of mane shrunk down to no 172 thingâ\\x80\\x94laid back like the ears of a vicious horse on the one side of the hoop, and reasserting itself on the other like the quills of an exceedingly fretful porcupine. In addition to this example of what the professional lion-hunter (as well as the lion) has to go through in Central Africa, Tickerocandua now inserted a couple of ridiculously narrow shelves in the back of the cage for the accommodation of a pair of lionesses ; and arranging the remaining five animals in the form of a sleeping- couch, he reclined upon them in a luxurious attitude, while those dangerous-looking cherubs watched over him from their exalted position. Finally, having re 172 ceived a carbine from the hands* of Mr. Mopes, and compelled the whole of the animals to leap many times over his head and shoulders at full gallop, he drove the seven into a corner, snarling and growling, and dis 172 charged among them, from his deadly weapon, a penny 172 worth of powderâ\\x80\\x94a ceremony w T hich concluded the representation of the method of conducting lion-hunts. During the whole of this spectacle Dick was trans 172 ported with delight ; he had never imagined such a mastery over creatures he had so often admired and dreaded was attainable, and he looked upon him whoTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 253 had achieved it, as the bravest, and perhaps the best of men. There was so undisguised an expression of wor 172 ship in his countenance, that Tickerocandua himself, accustomed as he was to the incense of public adoration, bowed to the lad in a stately manner as he passed through the crowd ; and when he reached his caravan, and felt Dickâ\\x80\\x99s hand laid reverently upon his tiger-skin, he observed, in a voice less regal than might have been expected, and even a little thick, â\\x80\\x9cWell, what is it, young un ? Would you like to make your living among wild beastesses like me ?â\\x80\\x9d Dick replied respectfully that such was not only his wish, but his settled intention. â\\x80\\x9c Why, bless my liver,â\\x80\\x9d replied Tickerocandua, whose name, in private life, by the by, was Eobinson, and whose knowledge of Central Africa was derived from oral tradi 172 tion rather than from personal experience, or from books ; â\\x80\\x9c Why, bless my liver, I never seed a young fellow of your age bit soâ\\x80\\x94never ! Boys, ay, and sometimes gals too, I have seen .bit ; but a young man like you Lord love you, go away home to your mother, do, for the hexhibitionâ\\x80\\x99s closing!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I am going to belong to your company,â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick earnestly. â\\x80\\x9c I have got a letter from Mr. Trim 172 ming, who used to have the show, or at least from Mrs. Trimming, to Mr. Tredgold, to ask him to take me on here.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Eh, what ? Mrs. Trimming ! â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated the beast- tamer ; â\\x80\\x9c a young ooman with dark hair and eyes, as was Lion Queen here for a little time, only nothing would254 BICHAED AEBOUE; OB, ever induce her to go in among the hanimals, and her name is Lucidora ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ay, thatâ\\x80\\x99s her,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick. â\\x80\\x9c Come up along with me then,â\\x80\\x9d returned Tickerocan- dua, as he led the way up the steps of the caravan ; â\\x80\\x9cwe have plenty of time for a little chat together about old friends, for master and missus are at supper at present, and hates to he disturbed over their wittles as much as the creeturs themselves.â\\x80\\x9d The caravan was of polished deal, and consisted of three apartmentsâ\\x80\\x94one devoted to the Lion Hunter of Central Africa, one to the Earthwoman and her consort, and one to the purposes of a common sitting-room. The privacy of each apartment, however, was not so great as these arrangements implied, the partitions being by no means sound proof ; and, indeed, throughout the subse 172 quent conversation which was held in Tickerocanduaâ\\x80\\x99s sleeping-apartment, the words Woggadaboo and Wiggidy made themselves distinctly heard through the single plank which intervened between Dick and his new friend and the two aborigines from the Mountains of the Moon. The convenience, however, if not the seclusion of the arrangements, was undeniable ; the furniture was good if not plentiful, while every article of it had some use beside that which its outward appearance indicated. Not only was â\\x80\\x9cthe bed by night a chest-of-drawers by day,â\\x80\\x9d but one of the chairs hung down perpendicularly from the wall, until it was wanted, and the other turned over (sometimes when it was not wanted) and became a wash 172 ing-stand. There were little cupboards, too, like rabbit-THE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 255 hutches, for the keeping of all sorts of properties, hanging round the room in default of pictures, and one of them was the cellar, wherefrom Tickerocandua produced a bottle of spirits, and drank Dickâ\\x80\\x99s health out of it straightway, without the intervention of a glass. â\\x80\\x9c I always find thatâ\\x80\\x99s good for me,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed he, whenever I get away from those precious lions.â\\x80\\x9d To this Dick responded, â\\x80\\x9c Ah !â\\x80\\x9d merely, like a prudent lad ; but he thought within himself, that if the Lion Hunter of Central. Africa performed that beneficial cere 172 mony, after each of his representations, and the repre 172 sentations took place every hour, he must get through a good deal of Hollands in the course of the day. Could it be possible, then, that Tickerocandua stood in need of Dutch courage ? That he was acting a part that he was not equal to, and that when the play was over for the time, such a stimulant was necessary to recover him from subsequent reaction ? As Tickerocandua took off his crown of eagle feathers, and passed his hand over his brow, with something like a sigh, it seemed to the lad that such indeed might be the case. The tone of the beast-tamer, however, was blithe and jovial enough, as he asked after his old acquaintance, Richard Trimming â\\x80\\x94just such a careless self-congratulatory tone, in short, as that in which men usually do ask after one who lias been a boon-companion to them for some little way on the road of life, but since then, it is likely may have taken a wrong turning. â\\x80\\x9c Well,â\\x80\\x9d answered the lad laughing, â\\x80\\x9c he lives by photography, just at present.â\\x80\\x9d256 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, â\\x80\\x9c I was afraid that â\\x80\\x99ud be it,â\\x80\\x9d observed the other gravely, â\\x80\\x9c and Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry for it. An honest livelihood is the best, he it ever so hard a one.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Oh, its honest enough,â\\x80\\x9d explained Dick hastily, â\\x80\\x9cas far as that goes ; he lives by taking other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s faces, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Dear, dear ! so poor Dick has got to that, has he ? We always said there was need to hold oneâ\\x80\\x99s hat on with both hands in his company, and that even then he would be sure to pick oneâ\\x80\\x99s pockets. Such a clever fellow, too, and not to make anything of his chances after all ? Why this ere Travelling Hexhibition must have been worth at least twenty pounds a week to him. There was a yellow- throated sloth in it at that time as was five hundred pounds to begin with in any manâ\\x80\\x99s purseâ\\x80\\x94always a throwing itself upon its back, and requestinâ\\x80\\x99 of the public to come on if they dared for a scratch-match : and yet they do say Trimming lost the whole biling of it at three-card loo in six months. He was an awful gambler, was Dick ; the best card-player, billiard-player, skittle- player, and what not, as was to be looked on ; but nothing ever comes of that worth speaking of ; itâ\\x80\\x99s light come, light go ; or else thereâ\\x80\\x99s somebody else as is always just a point or two beyond you ; thatâ\\x80\\x99s where it is. Did Dick ever tell you how he did the Yankees over the water Vâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9c He told me some queer things of his own doings, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t think he ever told me that,â\\x80\\x9d replied the lad. â\\x80\\x9cWell, it was in the days of Trimmingâ\\x80\\x99s luck, and he had some six hundred pounds to the good about him ; so what does he do but goes to Hew York and loses aTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 2r>7 little of it in the best of the public billiard-rooms, and then by rail and coach to the far West, stopping at every\\' big place to lose some more ; and dropping here a little and there a little all the way as though it were a paper- chase, with dollar notes. When he got to Buffalor, or some such wild-beast sort of a name, he had hut twelve pounds belonging to him to bring him back to England, and then he began to calkilate that it was about time to think of making his fortune. So he played a little better at Buffalor, and commenced to win instead of lose ; and then a good deal better at each of the places at which he had been defeatedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cpicked upâ\\x80\\x9d as the saying\\'isâ\\x80\\x94on his way West. Those who had found him an easy victory before, could scarcely understand how a manâ\\x80\\x99s play could so improve in ten daysâ\\x80\\x99 time, and were riled thereby most uncommon, but of course they had to pay when they lost. When he got back to New York itself, he put the pot on to a very considerable extent, and won a heap of dollars nightly ; he told me that he did not get less than a couple of thousand pounds, in all, out of that same room; and he would have made more, only one night an accident happened which might have been rather serious. He perceived, by the behaviour of some of the players, that he had been â\\x80\\x9cblown uponâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94got found out in factâ\\x80\\x94and by their savage looks and whispers among themselves, that a quarrel was going to be picked with him, after which, as he well knew, he would have to take one of Colonel Coltâ\\x80\\x99s lead pills, or become a sheath for a bowie knife. He saw he would never be permitted to get clear away m 2258 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, from them rooms again, and yet he had every farthing of money he possessed in the world at that moment ahout his person. He had won three or four hundred dollars already that vefy evening, and he placed the notes osten 172 tatiously upon the mantel-piece as he Avent on with his game ; then haAÃ\\x9bng contrived to cut his hand with the brass rim of a pocket so as to make it bleed, he left the room under pretence of going to wash it, in his shirt 172 sleeves, indeed, but with a whole skin. He never came back either for his coat or his money, hut went right away, and put himself under the protection of the police, until the steamer started for England.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c And did he get safe home with all the rest he had Avon ?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Dick, Avho could scarcely reconcile such a fact Avith the sky-parlour and modest manner of life affected by the gentleman in question, since he had had the advantage of his acquaintance. â\\x80\\x9c Ay that he did, and lived like a figliting-cock upon it for six months or so, by which time it was all gone and more with it ; he was reduced, indeed, so low on that particular occasion, I remember, that he had to take to the Dumby Dodge.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c The Dumby Dodge ?â\\x80\\x9d remarked Dick interroga 172 tively ; â\\x80\\x9c I never heard of that, I think.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Well, my boy, itâ\\x80\\x99s a profession that feAv people take up with for choice, and until most other trades have failed. You go about to sporting public-housesâ\\x80\\x94them in the dog-line principallyâ\\x80\\x94and stick pins into yourself for the gratification of the nobility and gentry ; thatâ\\x80\\x99s what is called the Dumby Dodgeâ\\x80\\x94because, I suppose,THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 259 you donâ\\x80\\x99t holler out when they hurt you. Dick Trim 172 ming had great natural gifts in that way, and couldnâ\\x80\\x99t feel, bless you, in the arms no more than if they had been stuffed with saw-dust ; his lips in particular, might have been orange peel for all that they cared about pins. But he had his tender pints, of course, and suffered accordingly. For my part, I should not like to see it done, a bit better than to make a pincushion of my own carcass, but diiferent persons are differently constituted ; and for the matter of that, it â\\x80\\x99taint a usual thing to lock oneâ\\x80\\x99s-self up with half-a-dozen lions and lionesses, ten times a-day, for the enjoyment of oneâ\\x80\\x99s fellow-creatures.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Thatâ\\x80\\x99s true,â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick, â\\x80\\x9c I never expected to see you come out of that cage alive to-day.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done that same trick,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Tickero- candua coolly, and entering a figure in his note-book, â\\x80\\x9c exactly three thousand times in the last four years ; I keep account of it, so that when my time does come, my successor may know exactly what he has to look to. Except Newcomo, the lion-tamer belonging to Edwardsâ\\x80\\x99 concern, that was Wombwellâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94and is the largest hex- hibition as travels, for all what our advertising bill says â\\x80\\x94I gives in to no man for pluck and steadiness ; but itâ\\x80\\x99s a bad tradeâ\\x80\\x94-a dangerous game, young manâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94(here Mr. Robinson took another pull at the gin bottle, as if to conceal a passing shudder)â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c and I should never advise you, nor nobody else, to take to it, if half the money, ay, or a quarter of it, is to be made by other means. The man who was here as lion-tamer just before me, was a black man, and would have been safe, one260 RICHARD ARBOÃ\\x9cR ; OR, would have thoughtâ\\x80\\x94to look at himâ\\x80\\x94from any animal that hadnâ\\x80\\x99t a very depraved happetite, indeed ; and yet that ere tigress in the fourth caravan from thisâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c The beautiful creature that is in the same cage with the lion ?â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Dick ; â\\x80\\x9c I saw her lying down to rest as soon as she found she was not wanted, and sleeping through all the noise and tumult of the hunt nÃ¨xt door, as though she were in her native jungle.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Sleeping !â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Tickerocandua contemptu 172 ously, â\\x80\\x9c that striped devil never sleeps. She does nothing but shut her eyes, and think of human flesh ; thatâ\\x80\\x99s my belief. She made but one bite at that poor darkey, itâ\\x80\\x99s true, but you might have put your head in the hole aâ\\x80\\x99most.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Has that tigress eaten a man, then Vâ\\x80\\x99 demanded Dick with horror. â\\x80\\x9c She has hilled a man, and eaten as much as she could of him, returned the beast tamer. I was tele 172 graphed for from London, and took his place within twenty-four hours afterwards. People ainâ\\x80\\x99t picked up in every town thatâ\\x80\\x99ll accept such appointments as this, you see, and particularly after these little accidents. I had been bred up to the work all my life, and was well worth my salary, high as it is, as Tredgold very well knew. Why, it was I who introduced the lion-hunt into this shop. I am the man that draws the company. If there wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a chance of seeing me eaten up alive ten times a- day, why, how would this show be filled I should like to know ? Do you suppose theyâ\\x80\\x99d stand a-gaping atTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 2G1 them elephants all day if there wasnâ\\x80\\x99t something start 172 ling to follow ? Donâ\\x80\\x99t they get tired enough of that fool Mopesâ\\x80\\x99 talk about the creetursâ\\x80\\x99 intelligenceâ\\x80\\x94and the beasts are sharp enough, itâ\\x80\\x99s trueâ\\x80\\x94and affectionate doci 172 lity, and so forth. Oh Lor ! just you ask Doll Jeehee- boy about that ! He knows something about their gen 172 tlenesses, he does ; he could have shewn you, one day, five smashed-in ribs and a broken arm in proof of it. I shall never forget him a-lying under that angelic-tem- pered Ninus, who had his off forefoot lifted up to finish him with, nor the voice in which he cried out, â\\x80\\x98 Oh Niney, Niney, what are you a-doing on ?â\\x80\\x99 as though he would expostulate with the terrible creetur.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c But he did spare him, did he not,â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick, â\\x80\\x9c or how comes it that the poor fellow is alive ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Oh yes, he spared him, just as the cat spares the mouse when he is tired of torturing it, for a little, being always certain of his victim. The beast would let none of us go into the den and drag Doll out ; however, one of the visitors went inâ\\x80\\x94a parson he was, and as milk- soppy a chap to look at as ever you saw ; but he was a brave gentleman. He said as how the same Power as saved Daniel from the lions would help him then in doing a good action. That was what I call bringing the Scriptures home to a fellow, that is ; and, for my part, I wish I could feel like him when I put on my boots and feathers every morning.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c You are not afraid, however,â\\x80\\x9d said Dick ; â\\x80\\x9cI am sure of that.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAfraid!â\\x80\\x9d returned the other scornfully; â\\x80\\x9cwell, T2G2 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, should think not ; what made you put such a question to me, Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to know ? I flatter myself that none of my feathers are white ones. Ho, no ; hut let the pitcher go to the well no matter how oftenâ\\x80\\x9d added the beast tamer gravely, â\\x80\\x9c it must needs come to smash at last. Itâ\\x80\\x99s risky, you seeâ\\x80\\x94the thing is risky after allâ\\x80\\x94there, thatâ\\x80\\x99s my last pull at the bottle for this evening and with those words Tickerocandua replaced the tempter in its pigeon-hole. â\\x80\\x9c But how did you pluck up courage to go in among the creatures for the first time ?â\\x80\\x9d persisted Dick. â\\x80\\x9c I can fancy custom reconciling a man even to such a trade as yours ; but the apprenticeship seems the wonder.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Well, you see, there were only twoâ\\x80\\x94a lion and a lionessâ\\x80\\x94when I first came, for the tigress I would then have nothing to do with ; and I could keep my eye on both of them at once ; and when I got to be straight with them, the others were added, one by one, and see 172 ing the old stagers behaving civilly to me, they did the same ; for all the world like human beings. They are jealous and suspicious of one another, too, and donâ\\x80\\x99t know how to pull together, thank Heaven ; beside which, they are afraid of the whip.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I should have thought they could have scarcely felt such a thing as that,â\\x80\\x9d observed Dick, pointing to the weapon in question ; â\\x80\\x9c why, the thong is scarcely so thick as that of an ordinary carterâ\\x80\\x99s whip.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Lift the other end,â\\x80\\x9d replied Tickerocandua grimly ; â\\x80\\x9c and then tell me what you think of it.â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 2G3 â\\x80\\x9cWhy, itâ\\x80\\x99s loaded,â\\x80\\x9d cried the astonished lad ; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s nothing less than a tremendous life-preserver.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Just so,â\\x80\\x9d returned the other coolly ; â\\x80\\x9c hut it is un 172 necessary to mention it to the general public. They would not be half so pleased if they thought I could defend myself. One tap on the right place from that there seeming bit of leather, and not a lion living but must go down before it, like a pin in a skittle-alley.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Youâ\\x80\\x99d hit him on the head, I suppose ?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Dick with interest. â\\x80\\x9cWell, you see, youâ\\x80\\x99re an outsider at present, young man, and these things are secrets of the profession ; but I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind telling you this much, that you might beat one of them lions about the head for half an hour with that there loaded handle, and he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t know but what you were only killing his fleas for him. And speaking of fleasâ\\x80\\x94of which there are a great many in this here shop, although they are never mentioned among the Collection in the billsâ\\x80\\x94do you know that it is about time to turn in, for we keep early hours ; Mr. and Mrs. T., too, must have done their supper this long time. You can have that mattress yonder for to-night, if they will give you leave, but afterwards you must sleep out in lodgings. Nobody but me and that Earthenware lot, as I calls â\\x80\\x99emâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94and Mr. Eobinson pointed with his thumb to the apartment occupied by the lady and gentleman from the Mountains of the Moonâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cbeing permitted to have quarters in the Hexhibition at night.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Then to whom does that beautiful caravan next door belong?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Dick.264 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, â\\x80\\x9c To the master and mistress, of course,â\\x80\\x9d replied Tickerocandua, with an air such as a sentry at Windsor Castle might assume, if he were asked who resided there. â\\x80\\x9c It ainâ\\x80\\x99t far for you to walk ; only take care of the steps, which are steepish ; and if you went a cropper down them, you might pitch on to the glass box full of ser 172 pents, which aint a pleasant family to break in upon un 172 expected,\\' I can tell you.â\\x80\\x9d With this friendly piece of parting advice, the Lion Tamer of Central Africa set up his bed, which was exactly like the flap of a dinner-table, and proceeded to divest himself of his jack-boots and tiger-skin.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 265 CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FOURTH. MR. AND MRS. TREDGOLD. Taking exceeding care not to disturb the great family of ophidia, snugly reposing in their blankets of many folds, Mr. Richard Arbour once more descended into the exhi 172 bition. The place was quite deserted of human occu 172 pants, all the duties of the company in connection with the brute creation having been fulfilled. Only a stifled bark from the jackal proclaimed his sense of wrong at not being let out to the grave-yards upon so beautiful a summer night, and a disappointed cry from the cheetah, intimated that he was hunting in his dreams, and had just missed his spring at a phantom antelope. The horned owl, indeed, was wide awake, with his ears unne 172 cessarily erect, and his eyes exceedingly like a pair of policemanâ\\x80\\x99s lanterns, fixed suspiciously on nothing parti 172 cular ; but, as he was never known to be otherwise, it is not necessary to except either him, or the weazel, from the general drowsiness. The stork, with a misdirected economy, was husbanding one of her spindle legs as usual, by making the other do double duty, and had wrapped her wing carefully about her head, as a servant- N266 KICHAED AEBOUK ; OE, girl carries her prayer-book in her handkerchief. A monkey or two, swung by their tails, like pendulums, as if anxious to take note of time even while they slept ; and the porcupines were huddled together in a manner to make a thin-skinned spectator shudder, and with a natural affection overcoming circumstance greater than their brethren of the quill, the Poets, ever described in song. The rap which Dick administered with the highly- polished knocker upon the highly-polished door of Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s residence, did resound amid the general silence rather alarmingly ; but he was not prepared to hear the holt shot with great sharpness upon the other side, and a tremulous voice demanding through the keyhole what was the matter, and in particular, whether that con 172 founded alligator was about again. This interesting quadruped, as Dick subsequently learned, was a recent addition to the collection, and the bane of its proprietorâ\\x80\\x99s existence. That benevolent gentleman had caused a mighty hath to be prepared for it, and had let it out, upon one occasion, for the express purpose of its taking its natural refreshment therein ; but instead of doing so, the animal had snapped at the company generally, and pursued his keeper round the show for upwards of an hour, with his mouth open, to the estimated extent of thirteen feet. Spare iron bars from the cages had been plunged into that dreadful vacuum, only to be snapped in pieces like slate-pencils ; and he was only captured at last by means of a casting- net, in which an experienced fisherman entangled theTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 267 amphibious beast, after a chase which lasted for an entire afternoon. â\\x80\\x9c What is loose, then, if it aint the alligator 1â\\x80\\x9d de 172 manded the voice again in tones a little reassured ; â\\x80\\x9c it isnâ\\x80\\x99t that there abominable nylghau I do hope, nor yet the puma ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c No, sir,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick, half suffocated with laughter ; â\\x80\\x9c itâ\\x80\\x99s only me ; and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got a letter for you.â\\x80\\x9d At these words the door was opened slowly and cau 172 tiously, as though Mr. Tredgold were yet unsatisfied that they might not be the ruse of some subtle animal devised to put him off his guard, and gain admittance into the caravan. â\\x80\\x9cAnd who are you, sir!â\\x80\\x9d demanded the pro 172 prietor fiercely, as soon as he saw how little formidable his visitor really was. â\\x80\\x9c Who the deuce are you, sir, and who is your letter from ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c My name is Eichard Arbour, who is seeking em 172 ployment in your service, sir ; and the letter is from Mrs., or at least from the young woman thatâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cFrom whom ?â\\x80\\x9d cried a voice so shrill that it almost set Dickâ\\x80\\x99s teeth on edge, and so close to his ear that he could hardly think a plank, however thin, interposed between him and the speaker. â\\x80\\x9c Bring it in directly, Mr. Tredgold : I insist upon knowing who it comes from.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou may fetch it yourself, madam, if you feel so excessively anxious about it,â\\x80\\x9d replied that gentleman, winking wickedly at Dick, and by rapid pantomimic action making him aware that Mrs. T. had her nightcap on, and was not in costume suitable for her appearance before a stranger.268 RICHARD ARBOUR] OR, â\\x80\\x9c Itâ\\x80\\x99s a business letter, my love, respecting the taking on of an additional hand into the establishment, and has nothing to do with you whatever.â\\x80\\x9d There was a rustling sound as though somebody were getting into a silk dress in a very excited manner, and in another moment the mistress of the caravan was in the apartment, thinner, and so to speak, skimpier than ever, in consequence probably of some deficiency of under-garment, and wearing a bonnet over what was most certainly never intended to be a bonnet-cap. â\\x80\\x9c Let me look at that note this instant, sir !â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Tredgold was a particularly stout person, and as he held the letter on high with one hand, and waved that lady spare away with the other, Dick bethought him how glad Mr. Sunstroke would have been to get them both upon a slide, as an allegory of Plenty defying Pamine. â\\x80\\x9c Who is it, Mr. Tredgold ? I insist upon being told. What is the name, boy, of this young female, who ven 172 tures to address a letter to my husband ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t tell her,â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated the proprietor, â\\x80\\x9c or you shall have no place in my service.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c You shall never put foot inside his establish 172 ment, unless you do,â\\x80\\x9d responded the lady. Here was a dilemma which threatened to defy all Dickâ\\x80\\x99s powers of conciliation and finesse, had not Mrs. T. herself put an end to it, by catching sight of the sig 172 nature of the missive as it fluttered tantalizingly above her head. â\\x80\\x9c You wicked, base, abominable man,â\\x80\\x9d cried she ; â\\x80\\x9c how dare you flaunt such a name as that beforeTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 2G9 my very eyes, and under my own roof-tree ! This is why you have been so short, and short, and short again of money is itâ\\x80\\x94for thisâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how long! Luci 172 dora, forsooth ! What, that trapesing wanton baggage as went away with Trimming, is it ? Oh, youâ\\x80\\x99re a nice respectable sort of married man, you are ! I suppose she acknowledges your last twenty-pound note, or so, and wants another, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll he hound.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou are a pig-headed old she-unicorn !â\\x80\\x9d responded Mr. Tredgold with some rudeness ; â\\x80\\x9cand you may read the letter, and answer it too, yourself, for all I care.â\\x80\\x9d The unicorn was a term of severe reproach among Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s company, from the circumstance of its forming a constant subject of complaint from the visitors ; the more simple of whom perceiving it advertised in the bills, were induced to expect its appearance among the animals, and were apt to be dissatisfied with the sub 172 stitution of the rhinoceros in its stead, and the informa 172 tion from Mr. Mopes, that that comparatively familiar quadruped was supposed to be the Unicorn of the Ancients. Nevertheless, Mrs. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s curiosity over 172 came her indignation, and she applied herself to Luci- doraâ\\x80\\x99s communication without reply. â\\x80\\x9c My dear Mr. Tredgold (â\\x80\\x9c Her dear Mr. Tredgold, indeed ! hoity, toity, well I like that : Oh you infamous woman !â\\x80\\x9d and the lady shook a bony finger at space, as though it were a female of unprincipled character.) As an old friend (â\\x80\\x9c Ay, old enough to know better, goodness knows ; Miss Lucidora was no chicken when she came270 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, here, for all she pretended to be so childish and timor- someâ\\x80\\x9d), and for the sake of old times (â\\x80\\x9c Very pretty, upon my word and honour, I wonder what she is going to say next !â\\x80\\x9d) I want you to grant me privately a little request. (â\\x80\\x9c Heavens, Mr. Tredgold ! am I to read any more of this abominable communication ? I feel my ears tingling from top to toe with shame already.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Tredgold muttered something about his being unaware that her ears had any toes, and even that it would do some peopleâ\\x80\\x99s ears good if they were made to tingle after another fashion.) This is, that you will admit the young gentleman, who is the hearer of this letter, and in whom I take a very great interest (â\\x80\\x9c Oh, indeed, you then, child, are a victim of thisâ\\x80\\x94this disrespectable hussy likewise, are youlâ\\x80\\x9d) into your company as exhibitor, or in some other remunerative office for which he may he fitted. Mr. Trimming desires his best regards to Mrs. Tredgold (â\\x80\\x9cimpudent fellow !â\\x80\\x9d) and yourself ; and believe me to be yours faithfullyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c Hers what 1 Oh the brazen-faced creature ! Faithfully, forsooth ! Do you hear that, Mr. Tredgold ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHear it!â\\x80\\x9d echoed that gentleman; â\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t hear it : hearing is no name for being pierced by such a cracked penny-trumpet ; you will split the drum of my ear.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Yours faithfully, Lucidora,â\\x80\\x9d gasped Mrs. Tredgold, without seeming to notice the observations of her irri 172 tated consort, but with a certain mitigation in the ferocity of her manner, too. â\\x80\\x9c So you thought to ingratiate yourself with me, young man, did you, by bringing theTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 271 recommendation of sucli a female, the disgraceful com 172 panion â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMadam,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Dick with firmness, â\\x80\\x9cthe person you allude to has been very kind to me ; if you have no place for me in your establishment, I must try my fortune elsewhere, but I cannot stand by and hear her spoken of in this manner.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou are right, lad,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Tredgold de 172 cisively, â\\x80\\x9c and I like you for defending your friend : he is quite right, I say, woman, and do you be quiet. I regret that we have no suitable occupation to offer you in the present juncture of circumstances (which was Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s favourite pleonasm for â\\x80\\x9c now â\\x80\\x9d), but Mr. Mopes suits us very well as chief exhibitor, and Mr. Taper is good enough in his absence. We have nothing, absolutely nothing, at our disposal.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Except the part of second butcher,â\\x80\\x9d interposed Mrs. Tredgold sardonically ; â\\x80\\x9c Bairman declares he cannot do his work much longer without an assistant ; you may help him, if you like, at ten shillings a-week, young man ; but that place, I suppose would hardly suit such a fine young gentleman as you.â\\x80\\x9d At this advantageous proposal, Dick looked up with 172 out much rapture ; but perceiving Mr. Tredgold tele 172 graphing over his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder that he should accept the situation, he replied meekly : â\\x80\\x9c Any place, madam, however humble, in your establishment, must needs be a respectable position for one in my circumstances. With your good leave, I will enter upon my duties to-morrow morning.â\\x80\\x9d272 EICHAED AKBOTJK; OE, Mrs. Tredgold had expected her proposition would have choked off the youth, and his humility disarmed her indignation. Her heart, too, was not without the soft place in it peculiar to females of every age, and Dickâ\\x80\\x99s good-looks, despite the disadvantages of candle 172 light and dusty raiment, had made some way with her Moreover, she knew that to retract her offer would aggravate her husband beyond judicious limits. She had her way in all domestic matters, and was permitted a considerable freedom of language and choice of epithet, hut Mr. Tredgold was master in his own caravan, after all. She knew how far she could venture in vitupera 172 tion, to an adjective, and could detect the notices of danger in her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s answers, as though she were a railway engine-driver, and he a flag-policeman. When he used the expression, â\\x80\\x9c you pig-headed old she-unicorn,â\\x80\\x9d it was the signal for â\\x80\\x9c caution,â\\x80\\x9d and her express-tongue slackened accordingly ; hut when he said, â\\x80\\x9c woman, be quiet,â\\x80\\x9d it was a warning to shut off steam immediately, or, at least, to shunt off upon a siding, and there confine herself to smashing coal-trucks and bullock-vansâ\\x80\\x94in other words, to rebuke her servants, and not her husband. â\\x80\\x9c And where will you sleep to-night, young man ? â\\x80\\x9d inquired she, pointing to his knapsack : â\\x80\\x9c it is rather late to be looking after lodgings in the town, I doubt.â\\x80\\x9d A man of less conjugal experience than Mr. Tred 172 gold would have here suggested that accommodation might have been given to the lad at once in the caravanTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 273 itself, but that sagacious gentleman held his tongue, and left the proposal to the lady. â\\x80\\x9c It is late,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick, â\\x80\\x9c and if you would kindly permit meâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c You shallâ\\x80\\x9d interrupted Mrs. Tredgold, with em 172 phatic condescension, and not perhaps without a wish to be beforehand with her husband in the proffer of hospi 172 tality ; â\\x80\\x9c you shall lie in that corner yonder for to-night ; but mind that you take off your boots, or else youâ\\x80\\x99ll scratch the boards.â\\x80\\x9d This apprehension lest Dick should employ himself like the Cock-lane Ghost, arose from the fact that the floor, the walls, and indeed almost every article of furni 172 ture in the room, were of the most highly-polished mahogany, wherein Mrs. Tredgold took a great and not unreasonable pride. It was evidently a vast relief to her mind when Dick explained that the Lion Tamer of Central Africa had already offered him an asylum for that evening, if they would permit him to accept it ; and when her husband asked the lad to remain and smoke a pipe with him before retiring to rest, she offered no .objection, but withdrew graciously into her own apartment, like any Lucretia, Griselda, or other obedient consort of antiquity. â\\x80\\x9c Sheâ\\x80\\x99ll be listening,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Tredgold to his guest in a muffled voice, â\\x80\\x9cso you had better not say any 172 thing thatâ\\x80\\x99s very particular, you know. And what about Trimming?â\\x80\\x9d added he aloud; â\\x80\\x9che was proprietor here when I was chief exhibitor ; but he made a regular mess of the business.27-i RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, Dick imparted what he knew concerning Mr. Jonesâ\\x80\\x99 manner of life, as he had already done at the request of Tickerocandua. â\\x80\\x9c A clever fellow, and yet a fool,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Mr. Tred- gold, by way of corollary, when he had finished. â\\x80\\x9c He had a genius, too, after a certain fashion. He netted up 172 wards of four hundred pounds in one day by old Mossy- face.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c A race-horse ? â\\x80\\x9d observed Dick interrogatively. â\\x80\\x9c Ho, sir, a lion. Many years ago, the elder Womb- well made a great deal of money by getting up a fight between dogs and lions, and Trimming resolved to do the same. There was a man named Jonathan, who had four couple of bull-dogs, which he offered to back against anything that could be brought against them, and a match was easily arranged between them and Mossyface. We dared not advertise, as Wombwell did of old, in the papers, but we sent out notices to all the sporting nobility and monied swells who were in the neighbourhood, and put the tickets up at two guineas a head. The match itself was for five hundred pounds, and the betting, which was in favour of the dogs, was something tremendous. The fight lasted three-quarters of an hour, at the expiration of which, there being only four dogs able to hold on (the rest having been wiped out by the paws of Mossyface), Jonathan cried out ; â\\x80\\x9c I have lost, but spare my bull 172 dogs.â\\x80\\x9d Had the dogs got the better, it was arranged beforehand that the exclamation should have been : â\\x80\\x9c I have lost, but spare my lion for, indeed, both dogs and lion were Trimmingâ\\x80\\x99s own property, while JonathanTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 275 was no other than our present animated lecturer, Mr. Mopes, who will tell you all about it. It was a fine conception of Trimmingâ\\x80\\x99s ; hut when the matter of the double ownership got to he known, it is said to have given some dissatisfaction.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHe seemed to me to he a high-spirited, good-tem 172 pered fellow,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Dick apologetically. â\\x80\\x9c Very much so,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Mr. Tredgold drily ; â\\x80\\x9cvery much so indeed, so long as he was pleased ; but when otherwise, he was rather the reverse. I give you my word of honour, that he was once upon the point of com 172 mitting a cold-blooded and atrocious murder upon the very person who is now addressing you. Because I refused to approach within a dangerous proximity of the animals in the course of my interesting lectures, he chose to he disappointed and offended ; and on one occasion, being inflamed with liquor, absolutely shut me up for forty minutes in company with the emu. I was in the same cage with that formidable bird, .sir, during the whole of that periodâ\\x80\\x94which seemed to me to extend over several weeksâ\\x80\\x94while Mr. Trimming and a brutal confederate (dismissed, I need not say, within the same hour in which the establishment passed into my hands) sat cross-legged outside the bars, enjoying the horrors of my situation. Thq emu, you may not be aware, is almost as big as an ostrich, and has a particularly sharp beak. I have got impressions of it on more than one portion of my person at this moment, and shall probably carry them to my grave. No, Mr. Trimmingâ\\x80\\x99s temper was by no means always equable. How does he behave,â\\x80\\x9d added270 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, Mr. Tredgold, sinking his voice to a whisper, â\\x80\\x9cto the young woman 1 How does he treat poor Lucidora ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Pretty well,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick sorrowfully ; â\\x80\\x9c almost always very well ; but not quite always.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Drinks, eh ? â\\x80\\x9d interrogated the other. â\\x80\\x9c Ah, poor girl, if she had only known what was best for her and who could haveâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c You are keeping me awake with your chattering ? â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the shrill-toned voice of Mrs. Tredgold through the panel, and her husband shuddered at it like a guilty ghost at cockcrow ; â\\x80\\x9c it is high time, young man, that you took yourself off next door. We keep early hours here, sir, night and morning, and Mr. Bairman will he glad of your assistance between six and seven.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ten shillings a week, then, and your keep,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Tredgold audibly, and as though he were concluding some foregoing conversation ; â\\x80\\x9c and lodgings you must of course find in future where you can.â\\x80\\x9d The conditions of the bargain thus concluded were not very advantageous, nor was the nature of the service he had engaged to perform by any means attractive ; but the frankness with which he had been treated by his new master was refreshing to Dick after the solemn reticence of the Darkendim Street government, and the companionship of Tickerocandua promised to be con 172 genial and interesting to him in a very high degree. That redoubtable hunter had fallen into so sound a slumber, that all the ladâ\\x80\\x99s efforts to induce him to open the door were fruitless ; and he was at last admitted by the Earthman in a costume scantier still than that inTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 277 which he was wont to appear in public, and with a bundle of flint-headed arrows in his hand, wherewith he un 172 mistakably threatened our hero with instant death, in spite of many â\\x80\\x9c How-do-you-dos â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9c Thank-you-sirs,â\\x80\\x9d delivered with even more than customary enthusiasm.278 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, CHAPTEE THE TWENTY-FIFTH. A LODGING WITH A LIONESS. As the full colonel of a regiment takes his ease and his annual stipend, leaving the conduct of affairs in the hands of his lieutenant-colonel ; or as the head of a firm holds himself aloof from the working members, and lets his junior partners perform the duties of the concern, while he himself leans rather towards the privileges; so did the first butcher of the establishment of Tredgold, late Trimming, depute most of the cares of his office to his newly-appointed assistant. One especial duty, however, did Mr. Bairman reserve to himselfâ\\x80\\x94namely, that of putting his four-footed victims to death with his own hands. Many men have a passion for slaughter by means of rifles and fowling- pieces, but Mr. Bairman was enamoured of the pole-axe. As long as he had health and strength to wield that weapon, observed he, in something of a devotional and submissive tone, he would continue to do so, as he had done for thirty years or so ; if ever he should find him 172 self unequal to the task of finishing off any animal doomed for sacrifice, he was ready, from that moment, toTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 279 put aside his sacrificial garment (blue) and the sacred axe ; but in the meantime, he would exercise his gift so long as it was intrusted to him. It was a strange and not very pleasing fancy, hut Mr. Bairman was himself a strange and by no means very pleasing man. His face was as deadly white as that of the most aristocratic daughter of Fashion, so that it seemed as though he had spilled something of his own vital fluid with every act of bloodshed, while a cataract of sandy-coloured heard de 172 pended from it, whereon he was wont to wipe his gory handsâ\\x80\\x94a habit which, even under less unpleasant cir 172 cumstances, is justly reprobated in the best circles. Mr. Bairman was not of that social disposition which gener 172 ally characterized the company whereto he had the honour to belong ; but if it had been otherwise, he would have had little opportunity for the display of geniality ; they shrank from his society and conversation in rather a remarkable manner, considering that their own callings were, for the most part, the reverse of delicate, and de 172 manded some strength of nerves. This gentleman was good enough to afford what he designated as a splendid spectacle to Dick upon the very first morning of his apprenticeship, in the slaying of an aged and decrepit horse. The fact of the poor animalâ\\x80\\x99s being blind did away with that necessity for fineness of treatment, upon which the artist particularly prided himself; but even as it was, the spectator was so perfectly satisfied, that nothing could ever induce him to behold a repeti 172 tion of such a performance. He would work with the barrow and the fork in the distribution of food to the wild280 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, animals, as in duty bound, but he would be witness to no more butcheries. Mr. Bairman was hugely tickled by this determination of his young ally, which he declared to have been his own when he first took to the business, and assured him that within a week or so he would come to feel quite differently. In the meantime, however, Dickâ\\x80\\x99s breakfast was utterly spoiled, and the ardour with ydiich he had regarded his new mode of life a good deal damped. â\\x80\\x9cNever you mind himâ\\x80\\x9d remarked Tickerocandua, to whose ear the lad confided his sentiments respecting his immediate chief; â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s a fine fellow in the shambles among tottering animalsâ\\x80\\x94a deuce of a fellow, as the saying is, among eggs with a stickâ\\x80\\x94but put him in front of a little bit of a cat like the puma, and I believe, if he had a whole sheaf of pole-axes, he would not dare to strike a blow to save his life. Why, when I wanted to give Regulus his castor-oil the other day, poor fellowâ\\x80\\x94 thatâ\\x80\\x99s the African lion, you knowâ\\x80\\x94and asked Bairman to lend me a hand, he made as much of it as though I had been going to administer him. The way is, you know, we tie his two fore-paws together and bring him to the front of the cage ; and then we get his mouth open, and put the oil down as easy as though he were a baby ; yet, if you believe me, that fellow trembled so that he spilt half the hott-le. He donâ\\x80\\x99t love me, I know, because I called him a funker ; not as I think it any blame to one as hasnâ\\x80\\x99t pluck to be unable to Â«hew it, only then he shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t go bragging about what he can do, and laugh 172 ing at other people who ainâ\\x80\\x99t so fond of bloodletting.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 281 Nothing \\'would give old Bairman greater pleasure than to see me eaten up alive, I know. Now, Mr. Tredgold is quite as much afraid of the beastesses as he is ; but then heâ\\x80\\x99s as tender-hearted as a chicken about others, too.â\\x80\\x9d Thus discoursed Tickerocandua, perched beside our hero on the lofty seat of the lionâ\\x80\\x99s caravan, and driving four horses in hand, which it was his pleasure rather than his duty to do ; for the Hunter was especially excused from all the fatigues and duties of travel to which the rest of the company, without exception, were liable. Every other person was expected to make him 172 self useful on the march, whether in running beside the leaders of the team of eight cream-coloured horses, which drew their band triumphantly through the towns, or in stopping the wheels of the giraffe-waggon as it toiled laboriously up the hills. There was no occasion to per 172 form this office to the elephantâ\\x80\\x99s chariot, insomuch as, like the Irish gentleman in the sedan-chair with the bottom out, that noble animal might, but for the look of the thing have dispensed with his vehicle altogether ; since while seeming to be drawn he really drew, as the more sagacious observers would sometimes discover, by catching sight of his feet underneath among the wheels. The procession commonly started on its journeys very early, as soon as those creatures were fed whose turn it was to feed upon the morning in question, and travelled very slowly. When they reached their destination, there was the show to be made readyâ\\x80\\x94a work of several hours N 2282 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, â\\x80\\x94so as to be opened to the public, if possible, on that same evening ; and then there were divers wants of the beasts to be attended to before bed could be thought of for the human. Dick led no very easy life of it in Tred- goldâ\\x80\\x99s late Trimmingâ\\x80\\x99s establishment, it is certain ; and if he had exchanged the China-trade for Lion-feeding, with the expectation of finding greater ease and leisure, he had made a mistake. Sunday was a day of rest to him which he had never before known how to properly ap 172 preciate, and we may be sure that he would not have spent one now, by way of holiday, in the Zoological Gardens. Nevertheless, except for the unpleasant character of his particular occupation, the young man was not dissatisfied with his mode of life, nor did he contemplate leaving it unless Mr. Bairmanâ\\x80\\x99s sinews should fail him, and the office of slaughterer devolve upon his own unambitious hands. Dick was a favourite among the whole company, except with the first Butcher, who was not in the habit of making favourites of anybody : even Mrs. Tredgold gradually forgot the lad had been once the protÃ©gÃ© of so despicable a young person as Lucidora, and 011 one occasion of indisposition, even made him a motherly present of a couple of family-pills. Mr. Tredgold was highly satisfied with him, and would consult him upon what was good for this or that of the larger animals, if Tickerocandua did not chance to be at hand. From the Beast-tamer, indeed, Dick soon learned all that that gentleman had to teach, as well as experiencing many practical kindnesses at his hands ; among which was this, that the whole expense and trouble of procuring lodgingTHE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 283 was saved to him by being permitted to take up his per 172 manent quarters in the Lion-hunterâ\\x80\\x99s house on wheels. On a certain dreadful winterâ\\x80\\x99s night, when the entire establishment was snowed up on a Yorkshire moor, and both domestic caravans were hospitably shared with the whole shivering company, Tickerocandua announced his intention of giving more room to others by making his own couch in the apartment of one of the lionesses, who had lately presented the proprietary with a couple of cubs. â\\x80\\x9c You may come too, if you like, Arbour,â\\x80\\x9d said he, half in jest and half in earnest ; and Dick answered on the instant, â\\x80\\x9c I willâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94although he felt some undeni 172 able qualms of terror as soon as the words had escaped his lips. â\\x80\\x9c You take your loaded whip, Eobinson, I see, not 172 withstanding that you have not the slightest fear ! â\\x80\\x9d sneered Mr. Bairman. â\\x80\\x9c Yes,â\\x80\\x9d returned the Lion-tamer angrily, â\\x80\\x9cbut it is because I am answerable for the life of the lad.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ah, to be sure,â\\x80\\x9d returned the other, â\\x80\\x9c the young man has not your determination of character ; that is true.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I beg of you, my good friend,â\\x80\\x9d observed Dick blushing, â\\x80\\x9c that you will use no extra precaution on my account ; I shall feel quite safe with you, without your whip.â\\x80\\x9d There was a murmur of approbation among the com 172 pany as Tickerocandua put the weapon aside, with â\\x80\\x9c Thatâ\\x80\\x99s my brave boy, Dick ; you would not dare to come, Butcher, though I took twenty whips.â\\x80\\x9d This statement being quite incontrovertible, Mr.284 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OK, Bairman gave only a ghastly grin by way of reply, and the Beast-tamer, turning his back upon him contemptu 172 ously, bade Dick put on his great-coat and bring a railway-rug. â\\x80\\x9c The old lady herself will keep me warm enough,â\\x80\\x9d said he ; â\\x80\\x9c but you must lie in the far-corner, as she may not take kindly to a stranger. You may talk in her company as much as you like, but you must not sneeze, or make any unusual sound, for her ears are easily offended.â\\x80\\x9d The establishment of Tredgold late Trimming, as the two friends beheld it on that wintry midnight, presented a singular spectacle. A long line of vehicles, as huge as were ever seenâ\\x80\\x94built for the accommodation of beastâ\\x80\\x94 since the Ark itself, cast their gigantic shadows upon the waste of snow ; motionless under the cold clear moon they stood, like some embodiment of weird romance, dispro- portioned, unnatural, and such as might be begotten in the dreaming brain through reading Mr. Edgar Poeâ\\x80\\x99s works, and after partaking of pork-chops for supper. The poor horses, released from the shafts as soon as locomo 172 tion became impossible, and huddled together in a circle that had with difficulty been cleared from snow for their accommodation, resembled some troop of phantom steeds in a spectral circus. The wintry blast that swept the moor was laden with sounds such as it had probably never borne beforeâ\\x80\\x94the muffled outcries of wild beasts from every quarter of the globe, astonished at the novelty of their situation, and wondering why the show was not set up as usual, and the public eye rivetted upon them with its customary admiration. This melancholy sceneTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 285 would doubtless have had a greater effect upon Dick, just issued from the warm and crowded caravan, had not his mind been so engrossed by the gravity of the coming adventure. He heartily repented of that foolhardiness which had prompted him to accompany his friend in taking up such dangerous quarters, although the fear of Man was so far stronger than that of Beast, that he dared not now for shame shrink back from the undertaking. â\\x80\\x9c There is really not the slightest danger,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Tickerocandua, reading perhaps his thoughts, â\\x80\\x9c if you are but pretty still. Only, in case of accident, be guided entirely by what I shall tell you. With these words the Beast-tamer undid one of the wooden shutters that was fastened immediately over the cage-door of the lioness, and without a moment of hesi 172 tation ascended by a little portable ladder into the den. Dickâ\\x80\\x99s heart beat loud and quick as he followed his leader, and almost leaped into his mouth as the animal gave a tremendous growl upon his unexpected appear 172 ance. â\\x80\\x9c Never mind her growling,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Tickerocandua coolly; â\\x80\\x9cwhen the creeturs growl itâ\\x80\\x99s safe enough, but when they walk round and round you, friendly-like, and shew their teeth without any noise, it is better to be upon the safe side of the bars. The tiger, indeed, will fawn upon you the very moment before he bites your head off. Poor old gal !â\\x80\\x9d continued he, approaching the majestic female, and patting her on the head, â\\x80\\x9cyour cubs are in perfect safety, I assure you ; they are being kept warm by your masterâ\\x80\\x99s fire, while Mr. Tredgold, who286 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, will on no account keep company with them, is banished into the bedroom. There is a young gentleman come to see you, but he isâ\\x80\\x99nt good to eat, so you need not stretch your mouth so wide in that direction. Make yourself comfortable yonder, Dick; I shall lay my head here, upon my ladyâ\\x80\\x99s hind-quarters, so that if she gets up, I shall be the first to know it.â\\x80\\x9d \"Whether Dick succeeded in making himself quite comfortable, is more than doubtful ; but he rolled him 172 self up submissively enough, and was silent. â\\x80\\x9c I will try,â\\x80\\x9d said he to himself, â\\x80\\x9c not to think of that confounded lioness, with all my might;â\\x80\\x9d but he was quite unable to keep her might out of his thoughts for all that. He fell a wondering whether she would eat the railway-rug first, and him afterwards, or swallow the whole bundle as the elephant did his oranges, without troubling him 172 self to take off the peel; and entertained a number of other ridiculous suppositions, which, however, were not the least less fearful because they were absurd. At last, not being able to bear longer this lying awake with eyes and ears at stretch, in silence and in darkness (for the shutter had been pulled to as soon as they were withinside), he suddenly demanded of Tickerocandua whether they were likely to have more snow on the morrow or not ? The Beast-tamer burst into a little roar at this, and the lioness into a great one ; so that it was sometime before Dick could get an answer to his important ques 172 tion. â\\x80\\x9c I do not know, I am sure, my lad ; but I knowTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 287 this, that you were not thinking very much of the weather, when you asked about it.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c No,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick frankly, â\\x80\\x9c I was thinking of that infernal animal; I canâ\\x80\\x99t get to sleep, and I shall go crazy unless you talk to me.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPoor lad!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Tickerocandua pityingly, â\\x80\\x9cit was wrong of me to place you in such a situation ; I will get up and let you out.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c No,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick firmly, â\\x80\\x9c I will stay here what 172 ever comes of it and no matter how much I fear.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Bravo,â\\x80\\x9d returned the Beast-tamer ; â\\x80\\x9c that is to have far greater courage than not to fear at all. The old lady here, however, will never hurt us ; although I own that now, when she has just had her cubs taken from her, I would not like to have her flying over me, as the others do, half-a-dozen times a day.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c How is it, by the by, that your face is often bleed 172 ing when you come out from that ?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dick. â\\x80\\x9c They all snap at me as they leave my shoulder,â\\x80\\x9d returned Tickerocandua ; â\\x80\\x9c and sometimes a tooth will graze the flesh for all that T can do. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s nothing compared with the labour of shifting them away, so that they should not rest upon me more than moment arily; if they leaped off less slowly, I should sink under their weight, even though their claws did not do for me.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c But does not the sight or taste of your blood make them dangerous?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Dick. â\\x80\\x9cI have always understood that that would set even the best tamed of wild animals beyond control.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c That is not so with human blood,â\\x80\\x9d replied Tickero-288 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, candua; â\\x80\\x9cbecause, with the exception of the Bengal tiger yonder, our friends do not know how good it is ; but if you came in from the slaughter-house Hush ! what is that moving about outside the caravan ? The old lady is getting uneasy. Great Heaven !â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated the Beast-tamer as the shutter was suddenly thrown back by an unseen hand, and a stick drawn rapidly across the bars of the cage-door, â\\x80\\x9c somebody wishes to murder us !â\\x80\\x9d A stifled roar burst forth from the lioness, making the ladâ\\x80\\x99s blood run cold, and the hair to rise upon his head, as if under the influence of the electric wheel. He felt that roar to be his death-knell; a prayer passed through his mind, which he had neither time nor power to utter; and before his eyes a glimpse of that dead motherâ\\x80\\x99s face, which he was perhaps about to see again, and for ever; and then the voice of Tickerocandua smote upon his ear, awaking him once more to life and action. It was not the Beast-tamerâ\\x80\\x99s ordinary tone, but the suppressed utterance of one engaged in some tre 172 mendous physical struggle who has no breath to lose. â\\x80\\x9cBush to the door; undo the bolt, lad; that is the only way that our lives can now be saved !â\\x80\\x9d Dick had his fingers on the fastening before Tickero 172 candua had finished his sentence; as the iron bars swung swiftly back, there was a hurtling noise in the air behind him; and, as he leaped, a flying body came with tremendous force upon his back, and rolled with him over and over, out of the cage. This was Tickerocandua, who had been sitting uponTIIE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 289 the head of the lioness until ejected from the position in that undignified manner. Dick and he would not have been safe yet, but that the enraged animal, in her furious spring after them, had well-nigh stunned herself by coming in contact with the iron-sheathed wall of the cage. Before she could perceive that the path of liberty lay open to her, the Beast-tamer had leaped up and closed it, whereupon the creature set up such a roar of baffled rage as brought half the company out of their sleeping-places, despite the bitterness of the night. â\\x80\\x9cThank Heaven, you are safe!â\\x80\\x9d cried they, when they beheld the two friends standing on the right side of the bars ; â\\x80\\x9c we feared that Dido had devoured you. What on earth have you done to enrage her ?â\\x80\\x9d Tickerocandua, whose colour had entirely left his cheeks, answered not a word. â\\x80\\x9c Fetch my whip, Dickâ\\x80\\x94 do not lose one moment ! â\\x80\\x9d cried he. â\\x80\\x9c You surely are not going to venture,â\\x80\\x9d began the lad ; but the expression of the Beast-tamerâ\\x80\\x99s counte 172 nance became so terrible, that he interrupted himself in the middle of his expostulation, and ran for the weapon without another word. The lioness, with open mouth, was thrusting her foreclaws through the bars, as though she would have torn his heart out, when Tickerocandua re-entered the cage, closing the gate behind him. She turned round with a short snarl, and sprang right at him, while the spectators shuddered at the horror which seemed inevi 172 table ; but the man lightly stepped aside, and bringing the butt-end of his weapon down upon her with no290 EICHAED AEBOÃ\\x9cE ; OE, great force as it seemed, the mighty beast, so instincr with strength and fury, lay in a moment motionless upon the floor of the den. He waited, with his foot upon her neck, till she recovered herself, when he beat her with the thong severely upon the back and legs ; after which he stepped out of the cage with great deliberation, observing to Dick that he was sorry to have had to punish the old lady, hut that if he had suffered lier to imagine herself his conqueror, even for an hour, his life would have been sacrificed on the next occasion that he entered the den. â\\x80\\x9cThere is one, however,â\\x80\\x9d added the Beast-tamer, suddenly seizing upon Mr. Bairman, who had been look 172 ing on with a very chagrined expression of countenance, â\\x80\\x9cto whom both you and I, Dick, owe a debt which I have much pleasure in settling.â\\x80\\x9d And with that, before any one could interpose, he had administered a dozen cuts of the whip across the face of the first Butcher, whereby that malignant disturber of the sleeping lioness and her lodgers was marked like the zebra of the desert for months to come.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 291 CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SIXTH. A MAN OF BUSINESS AND PLEASURE. It was a singular proof of the tenacity with which the Human, however fallen, will still cling to the skirts of Respectability, â\\x96\\xa0that Mr. Richard Arbour did not inform his friends, throughout this period, of the precise nature of his employment in Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s establishment. He was gaining an honest living by purveying their necessary aliment to Godâ\\x80\\x99s creatures, and yet he was ashamed of it. If he had been butchering the same for his own pleasure, with the latest description of fowling- piece, he would have written of his occupation not without a glow of personal vanity, but as it was, he â\\x80\\x9csankâ\\x80\\x9d the slaughter-house, and I am afraid rather led Miss Lucy Mickleham to understand that he was per 172 manently engaged, under the indirect patronage of Royalty (and indeed Y.R. always headed Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s posters) in certain scientific experiments in Natural History. Even Sister Maggie was cognizant of no more than that the outcast was bread-winning in some humble capacity connected with the animal world, and that being likely to better himself, he did not care toRICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, mention more particularly what his occupation was. Mr. William Mickleliam, while playfully announcing his be 172 lief that the Family Scapegrace was parading the south of England with a hear and a monkey, and would some day present himself at their gate to the sound of a tam 172 bourine or hand-organ, was quite unaware that in so saying he was in reality rather overestimating his young friendâ\\x80\\x99s social position. Nevertheless, these three held many Ã\\xa0 council concerning the absent lad and his pros 172 pects ; Lucy and Maggie, because they loved him ; and William, because, as the scaffolding whereby an attach 172 ment (fast rising to the story of affection) had been built up between himself and Maggie, he owed him no little gratitude. That Kensington cottage was indeed a holiday-house to the poor young lady, escaped for a while from the grim mansion in Golden Square, and the companionship of Adolphus and Maria, who, had they dared, would have treated her no better than Cinderella. Uncle Ingram, however, did not lose his affection for her, and strove, as it seemed, to make amends for the future wrong that he contemplated by present indul 172 gence. He took her into his confidenceâ\\x80\\x94which was, however, only a sort of mental counting-house, wherein he kept his business-speculationsâ\\x80\\x94and threw open for her all the chambers of his heart ; all, that is, save one â\\x96\\xa0â\\x80\\x94the Bluebeard Chamber, which it was forbidden for any to glance at, wherein he nursed his wrath and kept it warm against Nephew Dick. Perhaps the sense of justice, which was really strong within the old man, andTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 293 could, now and then, even overcome a prejudice, re 172 proached him with his hardness towards the boyâ\\x80\\x94whom he always pictured to himself as a boy, impatient of control, and obstinate under punishmentâ\\x80\\x94and made the subject more hateful to him than it would else have been. At all events, Maria could change her uncleâ\\x80\\x99s mood of doting fondness for her sister at any time, to one of anxiety and suspicion, by dropping a casual word which should remind him of the intimacy, still un 172 broken, between Maggie and Dick. Mr. Ingram Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s memory was waning upon many points but not upon this. He forgot some matters which had formerly been at least as familiar to him as his prayers ; his judgment upon matters of business, in former days so uniformly clear and decisive, was now apt to vacillate ; but he always remembered that there was one Dick Arbour who had turned out a disgrace to the family, and never wavered in his determination to separate it from him, and him from it. The diligence and activity manifested by Adolphus in Darkendim Street, and the good reports of Lawyer Johnnieâ\\x80\\x99s assiduity in the country, contrasted strongly with the misconduct of their younger brother ; he of course looked all the blacker by contrast ; and it is possible that these whited sepulchres, on their parts, received an additional coat of purity by the comparison. It may have been the absence of that foil, perhaps, which prevented Adolphus from appearing so excellent a man of business in the eyes of Mr. Mickleham as in those of his uncle. To the sagacious managing-clerk, it was evident that the steady but successful course pur-294 EICHAED ABSQUE; OB, sued by the Head of the Firm for so many years was little relished by the junior partner ; and that though cautious and prudent enough by nature, the young man beheld with impatience the many chances of great gains which spring up in the path of every important com 172 mercial house, rejected for the comparatively insignifi 172 cant profits of mere legitimate trading. This was especially apparent since the return of Mr. Adolphus Arbour from a late business expedition to Paris, where he had picked up and brought back with him certain brittle opinions concerning the extension of the china trade, as well as a personal friend in one Mr. Frederick Charlecot, who abetted him in the same. This gentleman, who had laid him under some chance obligations at a cafÃ©, by becoming his successful inter 172 preter in a squabble with the waiter respecting his bill, was not himself a man of business. On that first occa 172 sion of their acquaintance, and while sipping the Johan- nisburg, which he had politely invited Adolphus to share with him, he had confessed, with regret, that his means having always been sufficient for his moderate w T ants, he had never embarked in any of those streams of enterprise which were the boast and life-blood of their common country. â\\x80\\x9c They interest me, they have a charm and an attraction for my intellect, such as it is,â\\x80\\x9d observed he, â\\x80\\x9c but I have never been practically concerned with them. I have made other menâ\\x80\\x99s fortunes more than once, by suggesting this and that line of conduct, which recom 172 mended itself to my theoretic commercial judgment ; it was doubtless assisted by that combination of chancesTHE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 295 which enters more or less into every speculation, but iny friends were as grateful as though I had been their guardian angel throughout. I have felt, however, little ambition to incur the trouble and necessity of\\'making money for myself. I am an idle dog, you see. I smoke â\\x80\\x94and if you care for cigars, I think you will like this Cabana as well as any you will meet with in Paris. I drink, although never to excess, for that would interfere with my intellectual pleasures, as well as disorganise my digestion ; and I make friendships where I find any sensible, long-headed fellow like yourself, who is also a gentleman. My family is what would, I believe, be con 172 sidered â\\x80\\x9cgood,â\\x80\\x9d even by the most exclusive ; but through a too long residence in the everlasting atmosphere of Parisian saloons, they have become un-English, and too frivolous even for me. We often quarrelâ\\x80\\x94my family and myselfâ\\x80\\x94concerning our Nation of Shopkeepers. They accuse me of being a democrat and a sans cullottc, because I affirm that a merchant-prince is as good as a prince who is not a merchant. They would consider you, sir, if, as your name suggests, you are a connection of the great house of Arbourâ\\x80\\x94in the light of aâ\\x80\\x94upon my soul they wouldâ\\x80\\x94of a mere tradesman!â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Adolphus Arbour visibly blushed, though he replied with no little testiness : â\\x80\\x9cAnd why not, sir? Why in the world not, sir, I would like to know!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Exactly,â\\x80\\x9d rejoined the exquisite, lighting a fresh Cabana ; â\\x80\\x9cyou have hit the very gist of the whole question. Why not you should like to know? You donâ\\x80\\x99t deny it. Why should you ? You are proud of it. You ask if my29G RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, family are any better for not having their hands sullied â\\x80\\x94their very expression only the other dayâ\\x80\\x94their hands sullied by trade for the last three hundred years ; and I answer you, upon the honour of a Charlecot, that they are not the better. All that I demand is, that commerce and good manners should go hand in hand. I-should not, I confess (so deep are the prejudices of birth), I should not have been thus intimate with you, Mr. Arbour, had I not perceived that your commercial prosperity had been secured without the loss of an elegant refinementâ\\x80\\x94 if, in a word, you had fallen short of the perfect and polished gentleman.â\\x80\\x9d The insolent condescension of this address would have been mitigated to some persons by the simplicity and evident absence of a wish to offend, with which it was uttered ; it was redeemed in the eyes of Adolphus Arbour by the air and tone of the speaker, instinct with that easy assurance which only belongs to those who are set above the necessity of ingratiating themselves with their fellow-creatures, and by the fashionable, and even splen 172 did attire in which the descendant of the Cliarlecots was clothed. Lounging in this or that unstudied, but never ungraceful attitude, the stranger looked indeed like one who sits ahove the thunder of this work-a-day world, and who only mixes with it from motives of curiosity or amusement. Mr. Charlecotâ\\x80\\x99s expressed admiration of men of his companionâ\\x80\\x99s class was reciprocated by his new acquaintance, who, like many of his own order, reve 172 renced none so much as those who themselves have neither need nor wish to work. A second bottle ofTIIE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 297 Joliannisburg was disposed of during a conversation in which his new friend astonished him beyond measure with his acquaintance with the details of the China trade, surpassing even as a matter of special knowledge, but perfectly wonderful, since forming only a branch of that information which Mr. Frederick Charlecot professed to possess concerning all the various channels of British industry. â\\x80\\x9c You, Mr. Arbour, have one of those practical minds, that I respect and admire above everything, and which are worth all the learning and knowledge in the world. 1 have unhappily done nothingâ\\x80\\x94had nothing to doâ\\x80\\x94save reading and thinking ; dreaming perhaps of undertakings promising enough indeed, but to which I was in no position to give effect ; teasing myself with far-off visions of splendid successes, whose reality will be one day grasped by a less idle hand.â\\x80\\x9d At these words, delivered very differently from his ordinary unenthusiastic and indolent tone, Mr. Charlecot extended visibly a set of ladylike fingers glittering with gold and gems. â\\x80\\x9cYou are laughing at me, Arbour ; you think me a fool 1 know â\\x80\\x94you practical men are such scepticsâ\\x80\\x94but, upon my honour, I have such a bent for commerce, that I some 172 times think there must be a bar-sinister somewhere in 172 terposing itself between me and the Charlecots. Here, waiter, is the money, and half a franc for your own pocket, but not a centime more. Any other member of my family would have given the man a whole one, but one of my peculiarities, is the most rigorous economy in matters of social expenditure. I enjoy myself, but do298 KICHARD ARBOUR; OR, not pay a farthing more than it is necessary for a gentle 172 man to do : while in my accounts with my tradesmen, I am even still more exact and particular. Man of pleasure that I unfortunately am, I am in my small way a man of business also. Our road, I see, lies together, sir, although not for very far, I fear.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Charlecot paused opposite an imposing mansion which has the credit of being the most splendidly appointed, as also the most expensive, in all Paris. â\\x80\\x9cWe lodge here,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9c Is it possible that it fortunately happens that you are staying at the Hotel Gilbert also ? Madame and I have rooms above the entresol.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Yes,â\\x80\\x9d replied Adolphus hesitatingly, â\\x80\\x9c I do lodge here ; hut I am only come for a few days, you see. My room is a great deal higher up. Indeed, I thought the price of the first floors enormous.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Now, I like that,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Charlecot admiringly ; â\\x80\\x9cI do like that. You merchant-princes, who roll in wealth, are so eccentric about your expenditure. The Berlin Bothschild assured me himself, that he never put his foot in a cab except at a friendâ\\x80\\x99s expense. What is twenty guineas a week to a man who turns a million?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c My dear sir,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Adolphus with a gratified blush, â\\x80\\x9c we do nothing of that kind, I do assure you. We have, it is true, the use of a few thousandsâ\\x80\\x9d . . . . Mr. Prederic Charlecot leaned up against one of the marble pillars of the entrance-hall, and indulged in what, for a person of his distinguished quality, was uproarious mirth. â\\x80\\x9c Now, I do like that nowâ\\x80\\x94that notion of a fewTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 299 thousands in connection with Arbour and Nephew ! To underrate the gigantic character of your undertakings is so characteristic. The use of a few thousands ! that is capital. I shall remember that for Tuffnerâ\\x80\\x94you know Tu f iner, the Stock Exchange millionaire, of course you do?â\\x80\\x94that, and your room at the top of the house, are both excellent.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c But you know,â\\x80\\x9d replied Adolphus, who had begun to be not a little ashamed of being thought parsimonious, although a few hours previously he had been reproach 172 ing himself with living at the Hotel Gilbert at all, and wondering what the Head of the Firm would say to the billâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c but you know I am a bachelor ; I am not a married man like you.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c A married man !â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Charlecot in an offended tone ; â\\x80\\x9c why, what on earth led you to suppose that I was a married man ? Now, really, my dear Arbour, you have no sort of right to be so hard upon a fellow. I am not so young as I have been, I know : not so lively, brilliant, rattling a Don Juan as yourself; but, 0 ladies of Paris, I appeal with confidence to you against this accusation ! Do I, do 1 look like a married man ? a Paterfamilias ? Heavens ! an elderly person who pays ready-money for flannel and childrenâ\\x80\\x99s shoes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x9d replied Adolphus clumsily ; â\\x80\\x9c only I thought you said something about Madame.â\\x80\\x9d Again Mr. Charlecot laughed, but this time like the tinkling of any silver bell. â\\x80\\x9c Good again, Arbour ; upon my life, yon are very good. That pretence of respectability is perfect, and so characteristic. For my part, when300 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, in France I do as the French do, and in Paris, you know, one marries without benefit of clergy. Does Madame receive ?â\\x80\\x9d asked the speaker of a female domestic on her way to the first floor. â\\x80\\x9c She does, sir ; I go for chocolate,â\\x80\\x9d returned the servant. â\\x80\\x9c For three, then,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Charlecot. â\\x80\\x9c You will take a cup with us, Arbour, in a friendly way, and have a chat with Madame ?â\\x80\\x9d The apartment in which Mr. Adolphus Arbour found himself the next moment, was by far the most splendid in which he had ever set foot ; French magnificence had outdone itself in the profusion of gilding, the immensity of the mirrors, and the gorgeous elegance of the draperies. The most beautiful flowers sent forth their fragrant per 172 fumes from cornucopias of crystal and silver, while from without, the summer air came softly over banks of flowers in the balcony. In the centre of the shaded room was a fountain of alabaster, which diffused along with its pleasant music a sense of coolness inexpressibly refreshing to eyes just released from the heat and glare of a Parisian pavement. A piano stood in one corner of the saloon, with an open music-book spread out before it, while volumes of engravings, splendidly bound, lay on the tables along with the most recent of those French and English newspapers which principally record the transactions of commerce. A desk stood near the window with drawing mate 172 rials, and a half-finished sketch upon it, and a moderate 172 sized circulating library lay strewed, half on the ottomanTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 301 half on the floor, as though some literary epicure had been recently satiating himself, or herself, upon the tit-bits of fiction to repletion. The whole aspect of the room proclaimed a matter-of-course and every-day luxury, which is unusual indeed in hotel drawing-rooms inhabited by English persons, except they be of very considerable wealth and position. Even our richer fellow-countrymen can rarely bring themselves to look upon hotels as their temporary houses, and are com 172 monly, while resident within them, content to debar themselves from many of their ordinary comforts, from a perhaps somewhat fanciful notion of economy. If Uncle Ingram, for instance, had been so imprudent as to have taken up his quarters at the Hotel Gilbertâ\\x80\\x94 which his nephew did more for the sake of giving it as his address, and of consorting with fashionable company in its coffee-room, than because it suited with his habits â\\x80\\x94he would have certainly dispensed with his ordinary luncheons, or have gone out in the broiling sun for a biscuit, rather than have summoned one of its magni 172 ficent waiters and taken his mid-day meal off silver and damask. Mr. Adolphus Arbour had an intellect keenly alive to these differences of social expenditure, and the air of his new friendâ\\x80\\x99s gorgeous dwelling-place, filled his Ilritish soul with a reverent and sublime respect. If Mr. Charlecotâ\\x80\\x99s victory over him seems to have been somewhat rapidly attained, it must be remembered that his movements were masterly, and his massesâ\\x80\\x94consider 172 ing the weak nature of the opponent he liad to deal withâ\\x80\\x94overwhelming. He also began the contest on302 RICHARD arbour; or, advantageous ground, and with the sun at his back. The being able, when among foreigners, to speak flu 172 ently in their tongue, which your compatriot cannot use, is to possess a superiority over him, quite inconceivable to one whose sober wishes have never led him to stray beyond his native land. The insolence so complained of in the manner of Englishmen abroad is, I believe, mainly attributable to their almost universal ignorance of any other language than their own. They travel more than other nations do, and with far fewer poly- glottic accomplishments. How can they, then, fail to look stolid, and sulky, and discontented, when they cannot even ask for beer or complain of its absence so as to be understood ; when people with bayonets jabber at them civilities which sound to their ears like threats ; and when the whole continent of Europe seems to be inhabited by an idle and perverse population, who will not take the trouble to acquire even the rudiments of the English tongue. Then in periods of misgiving and pecuniary disputationâ\\x80\\x94when we do not even com 172 prehend the value of the coins we are disputing aboutâ\\x80\\x94 how pleasant is it to hear one speaking our mother- tongue in the strange land, and proffering the courteous offer of standing between us and the native extortioner. Thus it was that the butterfly, Mr. Erederic Charlecot, obtained his first hold of the money-spinner, Mr. Adol 172 phus Arbour ; and having that hold, he was not the man to let go again. Of all the attractive objects with which that draw 172 ing-room in the Hotel Gilbert gleamed, Madame was theTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 303 crown. Mr. Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s limited experience bad led him to expect, in a lady of such a more than doubtful social position, a coarse, however comely exterior, and a man 172 ner familiar and unrefined. Madame, on the contrary, could scarcely be called beautiful ; but her air and manner were elegant and distinguished in a very high degree. An aristocratic languor seemed to pervade her limbs, and give a pathos to her tones ; while her con 172 versation had that naturalness which only belongs to the very best society, and to people who are not in society at all. The latest queen of London fashion is said to have been seen sucking a chicken-bone, at a semi 172 royal supper party, without the medium of a forkâ\\x80\\x94an undeniably advantageous method of eating it, but one which you, fair reader, who are doubtless fashionable also, would rather die than adopt. She was famous, however, for a certain persiflage that occasionally culminated to coarseness. Madame, too, had a lively fancy, and was sometimes a little rude. She did not rise from her couch by the open window when the two gentlemen came in, but remained there with a bodlc in her hand, sometimes reading it, and sometimes joining in the conversation. â\\x80\\x9c I am glad to see you, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said she with a gracious smile, as Mr. Arbour was introduced ; â\\x80\\x9c I like to see an English face, and to hear the English tongue. Be so good as to eschew French while in my company.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI shall have the greatest pleasure in so doing,â\\x80\\x9d returned Adolphus ; the fact is, yourâ\\x80\\x94that is to say, I have even now been indebted to Mr. Charlecot for get- O304 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, ting me out of a difficulty caused by my indifferent knowledge of the language.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I daresay you speak it vilely : all Englishmen do.â\\x80\\x9d As if to shew, at the same time, that this was not the case with Englishwomen, she rapidly uttered a few French words to Mr. Charlecot in what seemed to Mr. Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s ears the purest Parisian accentâ\\x80\\x94but, then, he was not a very good judge. â\\x80\\x9c Madame acquaints me that there is a letter of importance awaiting me ; be so kind, Mr. Arbour, as to excuse me a moment while I look at it. I make no scruple, you see, of sacrificing the demands of hospitality itself to those of business.â\\x80\\x9d An open door at the end of the apartment disclosed a smaller room with a dining-table ; a massive escri 172 toire, contrasting by its plainness with the neighbouring splendours of a sumptuously appointed sideboard, stood in a corner, covered with papers, and before these Air. Charlecot sat himself down. Madame conducted a languid conversation with the visitor, returning the homage of his eyes with looks of courteous forbearance, as though she would say : â\\x80\\x9c You are dull, sir ; but observe, I do not yawn.â\\x80\\x9d But when his gaze wandered elsewhere, regarding him with an intensity of expression that by no means conveyed good wishes. â\\x80\\x9c You dine with the Emperor, I suppose,â\\x80\\x9d said she ; â\\x80\\x9c everybody does dine with him.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Adolphus Arbour was obliged to confess that, if that were indeed the case, he was but a nobody.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 305 â\\x80\\x9c Well, then, at the Embassy, at all\\' events ; it is there you have met Mr. Charlecot, I suppose.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Arbour replied that lie had not met Mr. Charlecot there, but in a tone whereby he wished to imply that that was singular too, considering the frequency of his own invitations to the house of lier Majestyâ\\x80\\x99s represen 172 tative in Paris.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c You must have seen De Crespigny often thereâ\\x80\\x94 the man whom the government have taken up so strangely in order to appease the republicans. They say that there has been some sort of compromise effected, but that it will not last.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Adolphus Arbour had not had the happiness of meeting the Count de Crespigny, although he had often heard of him. â\\x80\\x9c That is singular, too : he spoke of you as if he- knew you well. Did you not assist him once in some dangerous affair in London ; but no, it must have been a younger man. Have you a brother Richard ?â\\x80\\x9d Adolphus felt himself growing scarlet under the eyes that were now fixed steadily enough, although with apparent indifference, upon him. â\\x80\\x9c It is a mistake, Madame ; we have 110 brother Richard.â\\x80\\x9d Indeed ! then I misunderstood the count,â\\x80\\x9d returned the lady carelessly. â\\x80\\x9c Have you not finished, Frederic, with those horrid papers yet ?â\\x80\\x94you are always at busi 172 ness.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I have finished, madame,â\\x80\\x9d returned Charlecot, com 172 ing forward ; â\\x80\\x9c and the business has been a pleasure.306 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, Here is one of Tuffnerâ\\x80\\x99s funny letters again.

Here is his note for five thousand francs, you see ; one per cent, I suppose, or so upon his gains on the whole transaction. A ridiculous bagatelle, of course, in the eyes of a man like you, hut in my case very acceptable to defray any little extrava 172 gances. Do not take another cup of chocolate, but, if you have no better engagement, stay and sup with us in a friendly way.

INTRIGUES AT THE COTTAGE. The acquaintance begun in the Hotel Gilbert between Mr. Charlecot and Adolphus soon ripened into inti 172 macy ; and in less than three weeks from that date, the former had crossed the Channel, and was staying at Rose Cottage with the Arbours as a recognised friend of the family. It may well be wondered at that Uncle Ingram should take to his fashionable guest so readily as did his nephew ; but nevertheless, within a day or two of Mr. Charlecotâ\\x80\\x99s arrival, that gentleman was almost as great a favourite with the head of the firm as with the junior partner. His manners, indeed, were a good deal toned down, and had no longer anything of the rouÃ© about them. Madame, with a dotation of ten thousand francs, had bidden him adieu for ever, and consented to remain in Paris, where lovers are not scarce. There was a sobriety in his voice and manner, when conversing upon commercial matters, which, contrasting with his habi 172 tual liveliness, gave increased weight and importance to what were in reality attractive and specious plans. The3C8 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, profuseness of his personal expenditure by no means detracted from his trustworthiness as a prudent adviser in the old merchantâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, who set it down to the habit of one who had always enjoyed a superfluity of wealth, and in secret perhaps admired it accordingly. Mr. John Arbour, who, like the astute Adolphus, had a relish for expensive amusements, combined with a disinclination to enjoy them at his own charges, esteemed the companionship of his new friend beyond everything, and left his own legal web-spinning to accom 172 pany him to London and elsewhere, whenever opportu 172 nity offered. Above all, Miss Maria, whose personal charms were by no means enhanced by the revolving years, and who had begun to speak of matrimony as an indelicate insti 172 tution, unadapted for persons of serious dispositions, set her cap or rather put aside the cap which she had almost resolved to adopt, and set her slender tresses to entangle Mr. Frederic Charlecot. It was surprising how large-hearted and charitable she became in her judgment of moral delinquencies, when manifested in the person of the Beloved Object. It was scarcely to be denied that Mr. Frederic Charlecot was a worldly minded gentleman, with no particular â\\x80\\x9cviewsâ\\x80\\x9d with regard to the wearing of the surplice, and other nice ecclesiastical questions. That tongue, so eloquent upon the com 172 mercial advantages that would flow from the introduc 172 tion of highly ornamented earthenware spittoons among the Hottentots, was dumb upon any more decidedly religious missionary effort. To offer him an improvingTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 309 tract was only to facilitate liis vicious lialiit of smoking by supplying him with a spill ; while to take him to chapel was but to administer a soothing theological opiate, for 110 matter how â\\x80\\x9c awakening â\\x80\\x9d the sermon, Mr. Frederic Charlecot never failed to sleep through it all. The task of conversion which Miss Maria set herself, however, was not altogether without its fruits ; she com 172 bined (as is not uncommon with that peculiar class of theologians to which she belonged) spiritual endeavours with temporalâ\\x80\\x94she preached to him and made love to him simultaneouslyâ\\x80\\x94and one-lialf of her labours at least was crowned with success. She used to take him out gudgeon-fishing in the puntâ\\x80\\x94the same which had borne Dick, and Maggie, and his mother, up the river 011 the last day they spent togetherâ\\x80\\x94and, anchored within view of the cottage, for proprietyâ\\x80\\x99s sake, she would ply him alternately with sentiment and improv 172 ing talk. â\\x80\\x9c I was more than pained, Mr. Charlecot, yesterday â\\x80\\x94I was terrifiedâ\\x80\\x94 to see you asleep while Mr. Stirren Warmleigh was expounding.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I had a heavenly vision, Miss Maria, nevertheless,â\\x80\\x9d would reply the Incorrigible, â\\x80\\x9cfor I was dreaming of you.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Now, Mr. Frederic, if you go on in that light way, I shall leave the punt.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I think that would he dangerous, my dear young lady ; the tide runs deep and strong ; not but that you would fall a cheertul martyr to the maintenance of any good principle, I am well convinced.â\\x80\\x9d310 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, â\\x80\\x9cYou think too highly of me, dear Mr. Charlecot. I do humbly hope, however, that if a time of popery and persecution should again arise, and the rack and the stake, andâ\\x80\\x94and â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd the chop,â\\x80\\x9d suggested Mr. Charlecot gravely. â\\x80\\x9c My dear Miss Maria, how dreadful an image does that present to me : the keen and cruel axe ; those raven tresses.; that snowy neck ; that palpitatingâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Mr. Charlecot, I am astonished at you ! â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Pardon, fair lady, pardon ; my imagination was in 172 deed leading me too far.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ah, how I wish you would be less volatile, Preder Mr. Charlecot, 1 mean. You seem to fly from the contemplation of all serious subjects.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Do I seem, then, impatient of your society ? â\\x80\\x9d demanded the unabashed Frederic slily. â\\x80\\x9c You are very wicked, sir; and yet, somehow, I can 172 not reprove you as I would another. What is it, I wonder, that disarms my righteous indignation ? What mysterious affinity can exist between usâ\\x80\\x94children of two different worlds, as it wereâ\\x80\\x94that draws us thus to 172 gether ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a bite,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Charlecot interjec- tionally. â\\x80\\x9cA what, sir?â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the nymph, in a tone some 172 what sharper and shriller than the observation seemed to warrant. â\\x80\\x9c A gudgeon, my dear young ladyâ\\x80\\x94a gudgeon : did you not see your float bob ? You are looking in the water at your own reflection, instead of attending toTHE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 311 your line, and indeed I can hardly blame you. If I had not the original by my side to look at, I should be con 172 tent to gaze for ever upon its pictorial representation myself.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBe quiet, Freder Mr. Frederic. Take your arm away immediately ; I insist upon it. They can see us from the cottage.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cLet us pitch the boat upon the other side of the island, then.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c We will do nothing of the kind, sir ; and, besides, there are always barges there. Why is Margaret sitting at that open window, I should like to know, staring out at us in that fashion ? I think I had rather be put on shore.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Perhaps she wishes to be here instead of you,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Charlecot, smoothing his moustaches. â\\x80\\x9c You are a vain and naughty man,â\\x80\\x9d returned Miss Maria, reddening ; â\\x80\\x9c and I am sure that the child wishes nothing of the sort.â\\x80\\x9d This was a most accurate assertion ; for Margaret was the only one of the Arbour household upon whom the late arrival had totally failed to make a favourable impression. â\\x80\\x9c Your uncle seems to be exceedingly fond of your sister,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Mr. Charlecot carelessly. â\\x80\\x9c He is getting very old,â\\x80\\x9d replied Maria spitefully ; â\\x80\\x9c and when one is very old, one dotes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Exactly so ; and yet the law seems to take but little cognizance of the fact. How often we see old per 172 sons willing away their entire property to one individual312 RICHARD arbour; or, iii no way more worthy than the remainder of their relatives, who are left, in consequence, quite insuffi 172 ciently provided for.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c That, however, will not happen in Margaretâ\\x80\\x99s case,â\\x80\\x9d returned her sister ; she hasâ\\x80\\x94in consequence of certain circumstancesâ\\x80\\x94been excluded from all future share in my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s property.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPoor girl!â\\x80\\x9d remarked Mr. Frederic Charlecot, with as much astonishment and sympathy as a man could assume who was quite aware of the fact beforehand, and did not regret it. â\\x80\\x9c And yet it is in just such a case as hers that one often finds the excommunicated person left a millionaire after all. The old gentleman repents at the last momentâ\\x80\\x94thinks heâ\\x80\\x99ll â\\x80\\x98hedgeâ\\x80\\x99 as regards the other world â\\x80\\x94 forgives everybody, and leaves the object of his greatest indignation every farthing he has in the world.â\\x80\\x9d At this appalling picture of death-bed penitence, Miss Mariaâ\\x80\\x99s countenance fell from Eesignation to the calamities of others down to Despair on oneâ\\x80\\x99s own account. â\\x80\\x9c Good Heavens !â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Charlecot, you alarm me more than I can say ; not indeed with regard to the dis 172 position of my good uncleâ\\x80\\x99s property, when it shall please Providence to remove him from this sublunary scene, for riches are but vanity and a snare, and it is better far to be without them ; but lest ingratitude and disobedience should come to be rewarded instead of punished. If such a change should threaten the in 172 terests of morality, what course would you advise ?â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 313 â\\x80\\x9c A Deed of Gift, my dear young lady. Excuse my conciseness as a business man, when the moral circum 172 stances of the case seem to demand dilation ; but if I were your brother Adolphus I should put a limit to this doting fondness of your uncle while there is yet time. I should address him something in these terms : â\\x80\\x98 You are a most charming relative, and I have the highest confidence in your judgment and good sense ; but you are too tender-hearted ; that is your one weak point, my beloved uncle, and a very amiable weakness it is. You have announced your determination to leave your possessions to those who have shewn themselves docile and obedient to your wishes, and they naturally look forward to itâ\\x80\\x94not as money indeed, but as a better thingâ\\x80\\x94as a mark of the esteem and regard from him who was so dear to them while in life. Now, they cannot conceal from themselves that that determination is wavering. You say it is not, my dear uncle : very good ; you think it is not, because you are unaware of the excessive amiability of your own nature. It is in your power, however, to prove whether you or they are rightâ\\x80\\x94to shew the world that your judgment and moral sense are as keen as everâ\\x80\\x94by the execution of a Deed of Gift. By this means you can put it out of your own power ever to be cajoled by designing persons.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut to whom is my uncle to make over the money?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Maria, with an anxiety singular enough in one with whom the recipient could be only an object of pity as exposed to increased temptations. â\\x80\\x9c To Adolphus and yourself, for instance ; or, if p.314 EICHAED AEBOUE; OB, necessary, it may include your brother John. But as your uncle will thus confide to your hands the entire management of his own property by the deed in ques 172 tion, he may well trust you to do all that is right and generous to others.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I think it would be better not to tell John any 172 thing about it,â\\x80\\x9d observed Maria decisively ; â\\x80\\x9c it would only unsettle his mind, and prevent him attending to his profession.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c My dear Miss Maria, I reverence you more than ever ; you are, I perceive, a woman of business as well as of piety.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I am afraid not, Mr. Charlecot ; it is not my wish, as it is not my gift, to meddle with such matters. I am of an unsuspicious disposition, and am of opinion that the direction of all money matters should be intrusted to brothers, husbands, and the like. I know nothing but the affairs of the house. I became a housekeeper at a very early age, and flatter myself I understand my duties in that way as well as any person.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s another nibble, Miss Maria ; I saw it dis 172 tinctly ; he very nearly took the float under water. Throw in some more ground bait, and I think you will be almost certain to catch him the third time.â\\x80\\x9d These were the sort of conversations which took place often enough between Mr. Frederic Charlecot and his lover, but which we would not recommend as the basis of a serious flirtation for other young persons. He was well aware that the lady would become his wife for the asking, but he was by no means prepared to take herTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 315 â\\x80\\x9c for richer, for poorer,â\\x80\\x9d hut only â\\x80\\x9c for richer.â\\x80\\x9d If her inheritance from lier uncle could be secured in the man 172 ner suggested, the blood of the Charlecots might pos 172 sibly consent to an alliance with trade ; but in any other case he felt the sacrifice to be a little too â\\x80\\x9c alarming.â\\x80\\x9d In the meantime, Mr. Frederic Charlecot found it diffi 172 cult to suppress his sense of humourâ\\x80\\x94by no means the proper element to be suffered to appear in a love-passage, and pregnant with danger even to the most promising of suits. It is not pleasant to have oneâ\\x80\\x99s sentiment made fun of under any circumstances, and least of all when one is an elderly lady taking aim with oneâ\\x80\\x99s last arrow at the heart of a male. We would not wrong Mr. Frederic Charlecofs repu 172 tation as a man of taste by letting it be supposed that he chose Miss Maria in preference to her sister Margaret ; or that conversations such as that which has been described were carried on with the former while any chance of securing the latter, upon equally favourable terms, remained. The probability of Mr. Ingram Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s altering his determination in favour of the younger niece had struck him long before he confided his suspicions to Maria, and had moved him in the first instance to try his fortune with her more comely sister. On the first opportunity of his finding himself alone with her, which did not happen vei-y early during his stay at Eose Cot 172 tage, he took occasion to express with respect and deli 172 cacy his sorrow for the dissensions among that family by whom lie had been so hospitably welcomed. â\\x80\\x9c Do not imagine, madam,â\\x80\\x9d added he, â\\x80\\x9c that my intimacy with316 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, your brother Adolphus misleads me as to who is to be blamed for this.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI am not aware, sir,â\\x80\\x9d responded Margaret with quiet dignity, â\\x80\\x9c that the intimacy you speak of is either so deep or so long-founded as to justify such an interest as you speak of, and least of all as regards myself.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c If my behaviour, madam, has led you to imagine that my sympathies are enlisted upon any side save your own, it has only played the part which I have set it to do. I thought I should place it more in my power to benefit you by such a course, than if I had manifested the deep regret which I feel at the cold and cruel con 172 duct of those who should have known how to estimate you better.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I thank you, sir,â\\x80\\x9d returned Margaret : â\\x80\\x9c my position at home must indeed be pitiable, since a stranger can thus be moved to address himself to me upon such a subject.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c That I am a stranger, dear madam, is a misfortune which time will remove ; that I am a genuine and dis 172 interested friend, I hope soon to be able to shew.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I am not altogether friendless, sir,â\\x80\\x9d replied she, â\\x80\\x9c however it may appear ; and the few friends whom I possess are sufficient for me.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt is not well, madam, to reject friendship, even though it may be tendered by so humble an individual as myself.â\\x80\\x9d At these words, contrasting so strongly with the self- assured and confident manner of the speaker, Margaret could not repress a smile.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 317 â\\x80\\x9c You smile, my dear young lady, which is rare with youâ\\x80\\x94a misfortune to he regretted by all : a day may come, however, which perhaps is not even now a great way off, when your whole life will he a smile. I see already signs of repentance in one who has done you wrong, and who has power to redress that wrong tenfold. If I read the heart of man arightâ\\x80\\x94an accomplish 172 ment in which I am thought to have some skillâ\\x80\\x94your Uncle Ingram only waits for some excuse to take you once more into his loving favour.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI am not aware, sir, that my Uncle Ingram has shewn himself in your presence as at all wanting in tenderness and affection.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Not at all,â\\x80\\x9d responded Mr. Charlecot eagerly ; â\\x80\\x9c and I augur from that fact the best results. I refer rather to the unkindness which he proposes to commit after death ; to the unjust and unjustifiableâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Sir,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Margaret firmly, â\\x80\\x9c your knowledge of the heart of man may be accurate and subtle enough ; but with respect to the feelings of woman, or at least so far as mine are concerned, you shew yourself fallible. The habitual want of cheerfulness which you attribute to me is caused in no way by the knowledge that my uncle proposes finally to dispose of his property as he thinks fit.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I envy you, my good young lady,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr Charlecot bluntly, â\\x80\\x9c that superiority of mind which sets you above the attractions of mere wealth. In my expe 172 rience as a man of pleasure, I have seldom seen its parallel, and as a man of business, never ; the contem-318 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, plation of it is charming, and cannot hut he elevating to the moral sense. But with regard to this matter of your uncleâ\\x80\\x99s will, is there not anotherâ\\x80\\x99s interest involved, an 172 otherâ\\x80\\x99s prospects sacrificed ? Forgive me, if I have been misinformed.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Go on, sir, if you have anything to suggest, I pray,â\\x80\\x9d replied Margaret : â\\x80\\x9c if you have really any further and better end in view than that of wounding my feelings, pray hasten to it.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I was about to say, my dear young lady, that with respect to that other person, something, perhaps, through proper management, might yet he done.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Could you indeed do anything for my poor brother Dick?â\\x80\\x9d cried Maggie anxiously,her face suffused with a sudden glow of expectation, and the coldness of her manner changed at once to passionate appeal. â\\x80\\x9c Oh, if you could, sir, you would indeed prove yourself to he my friend.â\\x80\\x9d The bold eyes of Mr. Frederic Charlecot glowed with undisguised admiration as he replied ; â\\x80\\x9c I can, my dear Miss Arbour, and I will. A word or two from me to your uncle at the proper time will, I pledge my reputa 172 tion, bring forth not a little fruit. Nor do I despair of putting both you and your brother Bichard into a position from which you may pay hack scorn for scorn, and insult for insult, on thoseâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou are again strangely mistaken, Mr. Charlecot,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Maggie hastily, â\\x80\\x9cin the character of the person you address. All that 1 ask is, that the harsh 172 ness dealt out to my unfortunate and misrepresentedTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 319 brother may be mitigated, and perhaps some amends be made to him.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThey shall, they shall, my dear Miss Margaret,â\\x80\\x9d cried the other eagerly. â\\x80\\x9c But the payment, sirâ\\x80\\x94the price of your assistance ? I have unhappily nothing to offer you in return.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c This little hand,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mr. Charlecot passion 172 ately, snatching her gloved fingersâ\\x80\\x94for she was dressed for gardeningâ\\x80\\x94and pressing them with ardour to his lips. So instantaneously did Maggie withdraw the out 172 raged member, that the enamoured swain was left to bestow his caresses upon the well-shaped but tenantless gauntlet she used for protection against thorns. â\\x80\\x9c You are impertinent, sir,â\\x80\\x9d cried she with flashing eyes. â\\x80\\x9cHow dare you offer me this insult? Is it the act of a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x94nay, of a manâ\\x80\\x94to take advan 172 tage of one in my position, without natural protector, althoughâ\\x80\\x9d She stopped suddenly, and her colour rose even higher than before, as the thought of one nearer and dearer than brother flashed across her, whose arm, had it been by, would not have hung idly down during the last few minutes. Mr. Charlecot, at least for this once, read her mind aright. â\\x80\\x9c I am anticipated, as it seems,â\\x80\\x9d said he ; â\\x80\\x9c nor do I wonder that such excellence should have attracted another before me. But still, let me conjure you, if your affections are not yet wholly bestowed, to give me hopeâ\\x80\\x94to give me time rather to prove myself worthy of a hopeâ\\x80\\x9d320 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, She waved him off as he approached her with a gesture that almost suggested loathing. â\\x80\\x9c As you please, madam,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, in an altered tone. â\\x80\\x9cI offered you my friendship, and you rejected it; I offer you my love, and you disdain it. A time will come, perhaps, when you will regret both refusals.â\\x80\\x9d She answered him not a word; but if Indignation and Scorn had had any Medusean power in them, her countenance would have changed him into Trap, or other inferior description of stone, upon the spot. â\\x80\\x9c A charming attitude,â\\x80\\x9d continued Mr. Charlecot in 172 solently; â\\x80\\x9cbut the statuesque is not my taste. Marble as you fancy yourself, it may be that I possess a weapon which shall yet find your heart out.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c If you do, sir, I do not doubt that you will use it without scruple.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut not upon you, madam,â\\x80\\x9d returned he with bitterness ; â\\x80\\x9c you do me wrong, if you deem me so unknightly.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cUpon another, then!â\\x80\\x9d she answered vehemently. â\\x80\\x9cYou will strike at me through my affection for my brother. O wretched man, who, by your very language, tell me that you behold the depth of your own degra 172 dation, from what have you fallen that you should play so base a parti Know that not even for his sake, whose misfortunes you threaten to aggravate, and who is to me the dearestâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Save one,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Mr. Charlecot mockingly ; â\\x80\\x9c and that one has a father, has he not ? an old man, wedded to some foolish trade; indebted to it perhapsTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 321 for his daily breadâ\\x80\\x94for his daily happiness certainly. Would you not weep, if this delight, if this subsistence were withdrawn from him ? Beware lest it should be so. He clogs the wheels of commerce with his prudent sluggishness, and they would run the better if freed from such a drag.â\\x80\\x9d Every word the man spoke was dropped upon his listenerâ\\x80\\x99s ear like vitriol on a wound ; and he watched her writhe beneath the torture mercilessly. â\\x80\\x9cYou are not a man,â\\x80\\x9d cried she; â\\x80\\x9cyou are not even a coward ; you are a fiend.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c You compliment me, madam,â\\x80\\x9d returned he ; â\\x80\\x9cI am merely one whom the world has agreed to ill-use, and who repays the world after his own humble fashion.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTo ill-use?â\\x80\\x9d cried Margaret indignantly. â\\x80\\x9cNay, rather one on whom all good usage is thrown away ; whom no prosperity makes thankful, and no increase content ; one who seems born to flout at Providence by putting its lavish gifts to evil ends. You to complain of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s usageâ\\x80\\x94you ! I know far better men worse used, worse spoken of. I know of one, your superior in all qualities that become a man, who, lacking your money, manners, powers of persuasionâ\\x80\\x94shall I say, rather, your double-dealing craft, your seeming know 172 ledge (ha! you blush at that ; that touches you), who wanting that lacker of â\\x80\\x9c position â\\x80\\x9d then, that pretence of soundness, has sunk to low estate with few to pity him.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c You allude to Mr. Bicliard Arbour, I presume, at present the second butcher in a travelling menagerie of322 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, wild animals. The post may have its scientific advan 172 tages, hut it is certainly not socially high.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Second butcher !â\\x80\\x9d repeated Margaret to herself. â\\x80\\x9c I wonder whether this man is lying or no.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I have no prejudices myself,â\\x80\\x9d continued Mr. Charle- cot calmly ; â\\x80\\x9c but other business men, such as your respected uncle, for instance, would be excessively disturbed at the notion of having a second butcher in their family.â\\x80\\x9d Then, after a pause, he added : â\\x80\\x9c So we are to be enemies, Miss Margaret, are we ? that is settled ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I am not your friend, sir ; I would not take your hand in mine for worlds.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cVery good,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Charlecot coolly. â\\x80\\x9cI see your charming sister coming this way, who, I flatter myself, will scarcely share your prejudices in that respect. Are you for an hourâ\\x80\\x99s gudgeon-fishing, Miss Maria ?â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Frederic Charlecot had thus declared open war with Margaret before courting the alliance of her sister, and he was not long before he put his hostile intentions into action. He shewed himself to possess at least that modicum of virtue which is implied in the expression â\\x80\\x9c being as good as oneâ\\x80\\x99s word.â\\x80\\x9d He insinuated with the utmost subtlety into Mr. Ingram Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s failing mind the danger that he lay in of stultifying his own deter 172 mination, by rescinding that sentence of excommunica 172 tion passed against the Scapegrace of the family and his abettor. Every kind word which the old_ man addressed to his younger niece was carefully treasured up by the three conspirators, and used as a weapon against her.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 323 Every generous action was pointed to as a probable fore 172 runner of that great gift which should make amends to the disobedient pair for all. When these things failed to effect their final purpose in causing the old merchant to put the disposal of his property out of his own power, it was hinted that his nephew Eichard, disinherited though he was, was calculating upon his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s decease, and actually borrowing money upon those expectations, which he had been so solemnly warned did not exist ; while finally, Mr. Arbour was informedâ\\x80\\x94thanks to Mr. Charlecot, who had by some means possessed himself of that secretâ\\x80\\x94what post that young gentleman was occu 172 pying in Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s establishment, to enjoy which he had quitted that eminently respectable one provided for him in Darkendiin Street. All the importunities of his two designing kinsfolk, aided by their skilful ally, could not, however, prevail upon the merchant to sign any Deed of Gift. He had, he said, the highest confidence in the rectitude of Adolphus, the greatest reliance upon the dutiful affection of Maria, the warmest admiration for the judgment of his young friend Mr. Frederic Charlecot, but to take off his clothes before he retired finally to rest, still seemed to him an unnecessary proceeding. â\\x80\\x9c Who,â\\x80\\x9d he inquired querulously, â\\x80\\x9c had so much as heard of so anticipatory a measure before? Had they themselves? Had any 172 body? Where was their precedent for such a suicidal and unnecessary act ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cKing Lear,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Mr. Charlecot to Maria sardonically ; and, in her great desire to convince, theRICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, young lady was within a hairsbreadth of quoting that royal example. The Deed of Gift, then, was never executed ; hut as if to compensate for his obstinacy in that respect, Mr. Ingram Arbour lent himself more and more to the com 172 mercial schemes of Adolphus and his speculative adviser, and allowed them entirely to overrule the more temperate suggestions of Mr. Mickleham. So craftily, indeed, did they sow the seeds of disagreement between the head of the firm and that gentleman, that the latter very soon forbore to give expression to any remonstrances at all. The trusty Master to whom the Captain had formerly .been wont to appeal on all grave occasions, had now to sit sorrowful and idly in his cabin, while the good ship was being piloted by inexperienced and reckless hands.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 325 CHAPTER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH. THE PITCHER IS BROKEN AT LAST. After the night with the lioness, and the punishment of Mr. Bairman for his somewhat murderous practical joke, matters went on in the travelling menagerie as usual until the summer days came round again, when an honour was conferred upon it about equivalent to that of Knight Companion of the Bath with Mr. and Mrs. Tredgold, and C.B.s with the rest of the company. The whole establishment being in the neighbourhood of Windsor, and the drawing-rooms, pink, white, and blue, at the castle being, I suppose, voted dull in those July evenings, it was commanded to exhibit itself before majesty in one of the courtyards. Such a green ribbon had never before been conferred upon any but a Wombwell or an Edwards (although Mr. Tredgold had often hinted, both vocally and in his bills, to the contrary), and the excitement was proportionally tremendous. Mr. Mopes, who was not to be permitted to enliven the royal mind by his usual dissertation upon natural history, alone was discontented, and entertained no expectation of knighthood. Everybody else hoped326 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, that some comparatively harmless animal would make its escape, so that he might distinguish himself by interpos 172 ing between royalty and certain destruction. Extra pains, however, were taken to prevent the possibility of any such incident ; every bar and hoard were examined nar 172 rowly, four-and-twenty hours before the great event came off. The Lion-tamer of Central Africa was literally in the highest feather, and had been presented by his proprietor with a new leopard-skinâ\\x80\\x94his old one being considerably dimmed as to its spots, if it could not he said to have changed them. It was rightly concluded that upon him would mainly depend the success of the exhibition, as well as the fame of its proprietor. His own reputa 172 tion as a zoological monarch was now to be established in the presence of a queen of an empire upon which the sun never sets, and wherein every variety of wild animal is to he found. In future, â\\x80\\x9c As performed before the Queen, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York,â\\x80\\x9d and as many other grandees as should chance to he present, or whose names, if absent, might be good for a hill, would he appended to the public advertisements of his performance. The occasion, in short, was â\\x80\\x9csupreme,â\\x80\\x9d and Tickerocandua felt it to he so. He was determined to outdo himself as a tigress-compeller. The blood 172 thirsty Bengal we have already spoken of was a beast of few accomplishments, and did not exhibit those she possessed with any great willingness. It was Tickero- canduaâ\\x80\\x99s intention, for this great Once at least, to induce the animal to enact a part in a dramatic representation with her cage-companion, the lion. The piece was simpleTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 327 enough in plot, hut abounded in â\\x80\\x9csituationsâ\\x80\\x9d and hoops. The rehearsals were numerous, and succeeded one another very quickly by reason of the little time that was left for preparation. On the evening before that of the grand castle performance, there had been no less than three rehearsals, and the tigress was even yet im 172 perfect in her cues. Her magnificent companion roared and bounded to admiration whenever the action of the drama demanded those exertions, and finally represented rampant his portion of the royal arms for the concluding tableau ; but the Bengal was all tail and teeth, and stuck in the hoops. â\\x80\\x9c Tredgold has promised me a tenner,â\\x80\\x9d observed Tickerocandua confidentially to Dick, â\\x80\\x9c for every new trick that the beasts will do to-morrow ; and if all goes well, he will raise my salary to two hundred. And now hereâ\\x80\\x99s that ere pig-headed Semiramis a-jibbing at her jumps, with only time for one more teaching of her.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c There is not even time for that, I fear,â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick. â\\x80\\x9cI have been putting out the meat already in the barrows, and it will never do to put it back again, now that they have once caught sight of it.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I canâ\\x80\\x99t help that,â\\x80\\x9d returned the beast-tamer dog 172 gedly, â\\x80\\x9c I must give Semiramis her last lesson before I go to bed to-night.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Surely not with the food before her eyes,â\\x80\\x9d expos 172 tulated Dick : â\\x80\\x9c you have often told me yourself how dangerous it is to meddle with the beasts at such a time. With the temper, too, which that brute has, it would be madness.â\\x80\\x9d328 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, It was a rule in Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s establishment that no man should interfere with the beasts while they were feeding, or even while their food was within sight of them ; the attention of wild animals, like that of some tame ones, being apt to be concentrated upon their dinners, any attempt to divert them from which is extremely perilous. â\\x80\\x9c Her ladyship must whisk her tail a little more fiercely before she frightens me out of two hundred a year,â\\x80\\x9d responded Tickerocandua. â\\x80\\x9c Itâ\\x80\\x99s only her obstinacy, I know, for she is as sharp as Ajax if she chooses.â\\x80\\x9d The beast-tamer was not referring to the sharpness of the Grecian hero characterized by the poet as acerri- mus, but to the sagacity of her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s companion of that name, the lion. â\\x80\\x9c There is none so deaf as those who wonâ\\x80\\x99t hear,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick didactically. â\\x80\\x9c You may drive a tiger to water, but you canâ\\x80\\x99t make him turn summersaults.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Birds as canâ\\x80\\x99t sing, and wonâ\\x80\\x99t sing,â\\x80\\x9d retorted the beast-tamer grimly, â\\x80\\x9c must be made to sing.â\\x80\\x9d Apt and illustrative of the case in point as this counter-proverb might be, it was, however, a perilous determination of spirit that took the beast-tamer back to his grim pupils, tired and sick as ever human actors were of their reiterated rehearsals, and hungry for the suppers which they gazed upon through their bars. Dick heard the clink of a bottle as he left the caravan of his friend, whereby he guessed that Tickerocandua was refreshing himself ere going about his wearisomeTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 32!) taskâ\\x80\\x94a tiling which, frequent as it was with him after a performance, he had never yet known him to do before entering a den. It was impossible, of course, to give out the meat at the usual hour, and Mr. Eichard Arbour employed himself, in the meantime, in another dutyâ\\x80\\x94 that of looking to the ventilators of the cages. These were placed above the caravans, like the lamp-holes in first-class railway carriages, and through them the occu 172 pants of the dens might be reconnoitred in safety, as from that point of vantage at which Darius the king is represented in the peep-shows looking anxiously down upon the den of lions to which Daniel has been committed on the previous evening. Dick presently came to that particular ventilator which opened upon Semiramis and Ajax, whom the beast-tamer was by that time â\\x80\\x9c coachingâ\\x80\\x9d for their dramatic representation. The lion was performing his part with an unwilling obedience, putting in an occasional inarticulate protest in the form of a protracted roar. The tigress was smiling and noiseless, walking round and round Tickerocandua, and making an unreserved exhibition of her tremendous teeth, but by no means identifying herself so much as could be wished with her part in the drama. Intensely wrapped up in the prospect of the cold meat that offered itself to her within the exhibitionâ\\x80\\x94which, it being long past the closing hour, was entirely destitute of specta 172 torsâ\\x80\\x94she would ever and anon put her nose to the bars, and inhale its grateful perfume! â\\x80\\x9cMan, man!â\\x80\\x9d roared she with a frightful impatience, and then, return 172 ing to her tutor, would sniff and sneer around him, as F 2330 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, though she would observe, that there was as good meat within bars, after all, as lay outside of them. Â« My good friend,â\\x80\\x9d cried Dick, speaking through the aperture, â\\x80\\x9c do pray come away for to-night, and leave Semiramis to her supper. To-morrow morning she may he tractable enough, but to-nightâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Sheâ\\x80\\x99s got the taste of my predecessor in her mouth,, eh â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Tickerocandua grimly ! â\\x80\\x9c She may or she maynâ\\x80\\x99t, for all 1 care, but she shall go through the double-hoop, at all events, as sure as Iâ\\x80\\x99m a living man.â\\x80\\x9d And as he spoke, he held up the instru 172 ment in question, and cracked his whip for about the twentieth timeâ\\x80\\x94in vain. In one instantâ\\x80\\x94in a quarter of a secondâ\\x80\\x94in a space so short that Dickâ\\x80\\x99s eye could scarcely follow the action, Tickerocandua was downâ\\x80\\x94tripped up by the tigressâ\\x80\\x99s fore-paw as a wrestler trips his rivalâ\\x80\\x94 down, and bitten through the thigh with those cruel teeth, so that the strong man in his agony gave forth a shriek more like a cry from some of the wild creatures round him, than any human speech. Then he was silent, mercifully stricken dumb and senseless, while the beast stood over him, licking her bloody paws, and with every hair in her wicked beautiful coat astir with fury and lust for blood. â\\x80\\x9c Curse thee, thou striped devil !â\\x80\\x9d cried Dick from the roof above, and rained his hate upon the brute so fiercely and suddenly, that she slunk away, and shrank into the furthest corner of the den. â\\x80\\x9c Murder 172 ous beast, tearer of the hand that fed thee ITHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 331 come, my friend ; stir not, move not for your life Foul creature ! sneaking coward !â\\x80\\x9d continued he, not daring to withdraw eye or voice from the orifice, while with outstretched hand he gashed the tarpaulin roof of the show with his clasp-knife, so that he might thereby descend immediately, and open the cage-door the quicker â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c for every mark of thy damned teeth thy hide shall pay.â\\x80\\x9d A crowd of persons connected with the exhibition,â\\x80\\x94 among whom was Mr. Mopes, wringing his hands with genuine anguish,â\\x80\\x94were collected round the bars of the cage, horrified at what was doing, but not daring to interfere between the enraged animal and the comple 172 tion of her bloody work ; nor must the general inaction be too hastily condemned, since not one of them had ever been inside a den with a lion, far less a tigress, while he who would enter the one in question had need not only to secure his own safety, and that of the unhappy beast-tamer, but to prevent the infuriated Semi- ramis from escaping by the door which admitted him, and so scattering wounds and death among unknown numbers. To Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s credit it must be stated, that though strongly fortified within his own residence, and only trusting his voice through one of the shutter- slides, he never ceased to call upon others to fetch fire 172 arms, and rescue his faithful Tickerocandua at the cost, if it were necessary, of the lives of both lion and tiger. The only unsympathizing spectators were the lion him 172 selfâ\\x80\\x94who calmly lay down and yawned, as though the business was none of his, and only to be regretted inas-332 RICHAKD ARBOUR ; OK, mueh as it still further postponed supper-time,â\\x80\\x94and Mr. Bairman, who, from a considerable distance, was regarding the spectacle as though he could never have enough of it. Bor nothing of what was passing within or without, did the animal who had worked all this mischief seem to care, but with eyes wandering from her prostrate victim to Dickâ\\x80\\x99s face above, she appeared to be divided between the desire of prosecuting her vengeance and the fear of the consequences of such a proceeding. When 172 ever his voice ceased, were it but for an instant, she shifted her hind-legs restlessly, as if to spring, and sunk down again dissatisfied, but trembling, when the tones were renewed. At last, when Dick had sawn a hole through the tarpaulin sufficiently large, he squeezed himself through it, and swung himself down by his hands into the interior of the show. Eapidly as he effected this, the vengeful brute was yet beforehand with him. Taking instantaneous advan 172 tage of his withdrawal to renew her attack, she seized the still unconscious Tickerocandua by the chest, and cracked his breast-boue in her dreadful jaws. Still in swoon, however, the poor beast-tamer knew it not, and neither stirred nor moaned. Then it was, singularly enough, when it was evident to all that the man was dead, and no further harm could happen to him, that Mr. Mopes began to open the cage-door, determined, at all hazards, to save the inanimate form from desecration ; but he was thrust aside in the very act by Dick, who, seizing a crowbar, leaped into the den, and, dealing aTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 333 tremendous Mow at the cowering tigress, lifted his dead friend outâ\\x80\\x94lightly and tenderly as a brideâ\\x80\\x94and bidding the people close the door, as though it had been any other door, would have borne him unassisted to his own dwelling, had not Mr. Mopes, reverently taking up the feet of the corpse, assisted him. The rest were scarce more struck with the horror of the spectacle than with the courage and affection manifested by the young man, and with one consent forbore to follow, and inter 172 fere between him and his grief. â\\x80\\x9c Shall 1 run for the doctor ?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Mr. Mopes of Dick, as of his acknowledged chief in this dreadful matter. â\\x80\\x9cNay,â\\x80\\x9d replied he sadly, â\\x80\\x9cnot all the doctors in the world could give him breath for a single moment. We will fetch one presently; but, in the meantime, tell the people to be silent, and not spread the news abroad, for Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s sake. If this gallant soul could speak, he would say the same, for I am sure that his last thought would be for others. If it gets about that the lion-tamer is dead, the performance must needs be put off for to-morrow, and perhaps the establishment be permanently injured.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd who is to help it?â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mr. Mopes, in astonishment. â\\x80\\x9c How on earth can it be otherwise, now that poor Eobinson has come to this ?â\\x80\\x9d It was observable that whoever now spoke of the dead man called him by his real name, and not by the assumed title by which he had been always formerly addressed.33i RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, â\\x80\\x9c That is for our master to consider,â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick gravely. â\\x80\\x9c Am I not right, my friend ?â\\x80\\x9d continued he, apostrophising the dead body. â\\x80\\x9cAh, Mr. Mopes, you do not know how kind and honest a heart lies here, that will never beat again. I have neither father nor mother, and this man was both to me.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c He has nâ\\x80\\x99t left an enemy in the world,â\\x80\\x9d cried the tender-hearted lecturer, â\\x80\\x9c unless, at least, it be Bairman ; and to have Bairman against one is a matter creditable to anybody. He was always risky for himself, and careful for other people. He has not left his equal for lion and tiger taming alive. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s his new leopard- skin, see, a-hanging up so spick and span, and whoâ\\x80\\x99s to wear it ?â\\x80\\x9d There was a gentle knock at the door that opened into the interior apartment. â\\x80\\x9c Come in,â\\x80\\x9d cried Dick mournfully ; â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s nobody to be disturbed here now.â\\x80\\x9d A diminutive female figure, of a clay colour, entered quietly, and approached the dead man with a swift but noiseless step. She took no notice of either Dick or his companion, but taking from her left arm a bracelet of shells, placed it at the feet of the corpse, at the same time reverently inclining her head. On her return, the door was gently opened for her by an unseen hand, and the Earthman was heard modulating his harsh gutturals with some success, and throwing an unmistakable pathos into his â\\x80\\x9cWoggadabooâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cWiggidy.â\\x80\\x9d The sorrow, almost inarticulate as it was, of the two poor Earth people touched the hearts of both spectators deeperTHE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 335 than the most eloquent panegyric upon the dead manâ\\x80\\x99s memory could possibly have done. Bought and sold, exhibited and laughed at, as those two half-naked savages had been, there yet lay a feeling within them for one who had been uniformly kind to them, more beautiful by a thousand times than any mental product of civiliza 172 tion. The Earthwoman had given her bracelet as the woman in the parable had bestowed her mite. â\\x80\\x9c 0 Lord ! 0 Lord ! to think of that poor dumb creetur with her shells !â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Mopes. â\\x80\\x9c I had rather that that had been done to my dead body, than if it had been buried in Westminster Abbey.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cGod bless her !â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Dick fervently. â\\x80\\x9c God forgive me that I ever laughed at one of his creatures so much better than I.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c How all the gug-gug-goodness of a chap seems to come out at a moment like this,â\\x80\\x9d sobbed Mr. Mopes. â\\x80\\x9c I mind me now how he nursed me three years ago, just as though I was a suckling infant, when I had broken my leg off the dromedary. He hadnâ\\x80\\x99t a fault, hadnâ\\x80\\x99t poor Bobinson, except perhaps it was Old Tom.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Hush !â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick reproachfully ; â\\x80\\x9c this is not a time to speak of a manâ\\x80\\x99s faults, even when one is sure of them. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think he ever drank for drinkingâ\\x80\\x99s sake.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Mopes looked up with amazement, as though he would like to know what better reason need be given for any manâ\\x80\\x99s drinking than that of his liking it. â\\x80\\x9c He never took kindly to his trade,â\\x80\\x9d continued Dick, â\\x80\\x9c and therefore the greater the credit to him that336 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, he did it so well. He often drank spirits because he felt himself unequal to his work without them. Since you and he were friends, and in order that you may defend his memory, I will let you see what is written down here in his pocket-book. Look at the figures set oppo 172 site to these last dates : 4480, 4481, 4482, are all in this dayâ\\x80\\x99s work, and there is a space still left for the 4483.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c What does it mean ?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Mr. Mopes. â\\x80\\x9c What can it mean ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c It means, that whenever that brave man went among these devilish beasts, it was with the certain knowledge that that must one day happen which has happened to-day. If he had come out alive to-night, it would have been, according to his judgment, his 4483d escape Dick filled in the figures with his own hand, wrote after them, â\\x80\\x9cperiit Henry Bobinson,â\\x80\\x9d and put the note 172 book into his own breast-pocket. â\\x80\\x9c And yet to see him among them roaring creeturs,â\\x80\\x9d gasped Mr. Mopes, â\\x80\\x9c one would have thought him as composed and cheerful as though they were so many sofa-cushions. Why, if he was afraid, who, in the name of wonder, will be found to take his place to-morrow before the queen and court Vâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9c That is Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s business,â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick quietly ; and I must now go and speak with him upon that subject. The strangers will be coming presently whose office is with this dead body, for whom, alas, no friend can now do anything more.â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 337 CHAPTER THE TWENTY-NINTH. A DANGEROUS PROPOSITION. Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s caravan was more difficult of entrance upon the night of poor Tickerocanduaâ\\x80\\x99s death than it had ever been before. Dickâ\\x80\\x99s proprietor even proposed to that young gentleman (through the shutter) that their conversation should he carried on as in that scene of Romeo and Juliet where one occupies a post of vantage, and sentimentalizes out of the window ; hut the youth would by no means consent to this. â\\x80\\x9c What I have got to say is for your private ear, Mr. Tredgold, and is of some importance to us both.â\\x80\\x9d So the patron of lion-tamers undid bolt, and bar, and chain, with lingering fingers, and when the young man was admitted, refastened them with excessive precipitation. â\\x80\\x9c One cannot be too careful,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Tredgold, â\\x80\\x9c with such an awful example before us as has happened this day. It is a lesson against foolhardiness that ought to last every man of us throughout our lives. How I have warned and warned that poor fellow Eobinson not to be so rash, no mortal can teE.â\\x80\\x9d Dick bethought himself of the ten pound premium Q338 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, offered to â\\x80\\x9c poor Eobinson â\\x80\\x9d the preceding evening for every new trick, and began to despise his proprietor very heartily ; and yet there was little or no cause for his indignation. Mr. Tredgold had warned the deceased lion-tamer again and again, and it was against his express orders that the tigress had been meddled with while the food was before her eyes. Blame of a very serious nature, too, was likely to attach itself to the owner bf the beast for what had happened, and he was naturally anxious to make his own case good to whom 172 soever he could. Besides, although Be mortuis nil nisi bonum is an excellent sentiment in irreproachable Latin, there is a temptation for minds not absolutely mag 172 nanimous to shift the burden of their faults upon shoulders that are better able to bear it, and what shoulders can be more adapted for that purpose than those of a dead man ? â\\x80\\x9c For my part,â\\x80\\x9d continued Mr. Tredgold testily, â\\x80\\x9c I forgive him from the bottom of my soul ; although, after what has happened, I may just as well shut up my establishment, and take to the workhouse.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c He didnâ\\x80\\x99t get killed on purpose,â\\x80\\x9d observed Dick bitterly ; â\\x80\\x9c I saw the whole occurrence myself, and can assure you of that.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c You are wronging me, Arbour,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Tred 172 gold, with some dignity. â\\x80\\x9c Heaven knows T would have gladly sacrificed five hundred pounds to have secured that unhappy manâ\\x80\\x99s safety. If he has any relative at this moment living who has any claim upon him, Iâ\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 339 â\\x80\\x9c What a mercy,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Tredgold, entering the apartment rather hastily at this junctureâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c what a mercy it is that that poor chap has left neither chick nor child behind him ! Thereâ\\x80\\x99s always a something to comfort one, even under the worst circumstances ; least 172 ways, it is so with most people, although Mr. Tredgold and me, it seems, are like to he made exceptions. You donâ\\x80\\x99t know what Mr. Robinson was to us, Arbour, and therefore cannot fully appreciate his loss. We looked upon him more like a brother than as one in our em 172 ploy, I do assure you ; and now,â\\x80\\x9d sobbed the lady, putting her pocket-handkerchief to her eyesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c and now he is gone away from us for ever, and a matter of three hundred a-year along with him.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ay,â\\x80\\x9d added Mr. Tredgold, â\\x80\\x9c and such a name as we should have made if it had only happened, say next week, or the day after to-morrow. But now, hereâ\\x80\\x99s the Queen herself a-coming to look at us, and nothing to shew her hut Xinus and them loppeting elephants. I must let Mopes give her his lecture, I do believe ; and yet if he isnâ\\x80\\x99t in a good temper, as is like enough, he will abuse the poor dumb creetursâ\\x80\\x94just as though they were his propertyâ\\x80\\x94so as it makes my blood quite boil to listen to him. She has got the programme, too â\\x80\\x94gilt letters upon white satin, Dickâ\\x80\\x94with all poor Robinsonâ\\x80\\x99s new tricks upon it, and nobody to go through with them. After what has happened, if it gets abroad, maybe they will not let us exhibit at all. I have half a mind to go down to the police myself, and insist on their stopping us.â\\x80\\x9d340 EICHAED AEBOUE; OB, â\\x80\\x9cWe must be at the castle by five,â\\x80\\x9d observed Dick musing, â\\x80\\x9cif we mean to get everything ready by the afternoon. Sfieâ\\x80\\x99s as punctual, they say, as clockwork.â\\x80\\x9d .â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing to get ready,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Tred- gold despairingly. â\\x80\\x9c Who will care to look at them lions with never a man to shew them off?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c What woidd you give if a man was found to ven 172 ture his life and go in among them ?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Dick carelessly. â\\x80\\x9cWhat would I give Vâ\\x80\\x99 returned the proprietor with animation. Iâ\\x80\\x99d give anything ; that is *to say anything in moderation. Iâ\\x80\\x99d give a ten pound note.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c That was the sum you offered for each trick to a man who had been with those creatures more than four thousand times before.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ay, for tricks ; but just for going among them and standing thereâ\\x80\\x94Avhy, itâ\\x80\\x99s the easiest thing in the world, my good young man. There is no real danger ; none whatever, if you only keep up a bold front. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the meddling with themâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s the forcing them to pretend to go a-liunting as them lions donâ\\x80\\x99t like ; itâ\\x80\\x99s the hoop- business that riles them, bless you. \\' But as to just going in and staring at â\\x80\\x99em, why, my dear young sir, the power of the human eye is suchâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Very well, then,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Dick ; if that be the case, I think we can manage the matter. You and I will go together into the cages.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHeaven forbid!â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated Mr. Tredgold piously. â\\x80\\x9c I go into one of them devilâ\\x80\\x99s dens ! Do you hear him, Mrs. Tredgold? I, sir? No, not if youâ\\x80\\x99d pay meTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 341 down first upon this here table the whole of the Na 172 tional Debt in golden guineas. I feel wetâ\\x80\\x94positively wet with perspiration, sir, at the very notion of it. A pretty thing, indeed, for me to he swallowed up in the presence of my rightful sovereign.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c But I thought you said it was so easy,â\\x80\\x9d reasoned Dick, â\\x80\\x9c and that there was scarcely any real danger in it.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c So it is,â\\x80\\x9d repeated the unabashed proprietorâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c so it is, for any person that is any way used to them. I have never had anything to do with lions myself, as you have had. The cockatoos are my favourites. I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind the cockatoos or the marmosets ; hut my nerves â\\x80\\x94I give you my honourâ\\x80\\x94are so singularly constituted with respect to the larger animals Gracious mercy, what in the world is that ?â\\x80\\x9d A savage whineâ\\x80\\x94a whine of a hundred horse-power â\\x80\\x94rang through the apartment, and froze the current of Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s speech. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s only the tigressâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s only Semiramis,â\\x80\\x9d ex 172 plained Dick with coolness. â\\x80\\x9c They have taken away her supper to-night in punishment, and she is com 172 plaining of it a little : thatâ\\x80\\x99s all. A ten pound note, it seems, is the price you consider reasonable for making her acquaintance to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I said fifteen,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Tredgold hastily ; â\\x80\\x9c and if I did nâ\\x80\\x99t say fifteen, I meant it. Fifteen for Sem What a fearful tantrum she is in ! Do, pray, let some 172 body give her her supper, or sheâ\\x80\\x99ll be out. Fifteen for the tigress, and ten for the lions. One pound a minute342 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, for merely standing still, Mr. Arbour : what do you think of that ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c A pound for the first minute, and the rest of the money paid to my executors,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick drily : â\\x80\\x9cwhat do you think of that ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c And a hundred a-year, if you take to the business, and teach a trick or. two,â\\x80\\x9d added Mr. Tredgold, as if the intervening remark had not been made. â\\x80\\x9cListen to me one moment,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick gravely. â\\x80\\x9cI came here to-night with a certain purpose in my mind, which most persons â\\x80\\x94 and yourself as much as anyâ\\x80\\x94would consider to be a mad one. What has urged me to take it is no affair of yours, nor is it your duty to dissuade me from an enterprise for which I consider myself fully capable. Look upon my proposal simply from a business point of view, and then either accept it or reject it. I offer myself to fill Tickerocanduaâ\\x80\\x99s place before the Queen to-morrow : and I take advantage of a pressing emergency and an unprecedented occasion to demand better terms for myself than I could have otherwise procured. I ask, if I shall he successful to-morrow, the same annual income of two hundred pounds which you promised to your deceased ser 172 vant Stay, let me speak to the endâ\\x80\\x94if otherwise, I shall require only a grave in Windsor churchyard by the side of my dead friend. Let the posters and adver 172 tisements remain, as they run now, in Tickerocanduaâ\\x80\\x99s name. I will not disgrace it by any pusillanimous con 172 duct ; while, if I die, I shall do no worse than he has done. I know the nature of the creatures with whom ITHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 343 have to deal as well, if not better than he did, and I fully comprehend the means whereby their obedience is secured.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c But the tricks ?â\\x80\\x9d expostulated Mr. Tredgold, aghast at the audacity of the proposition, but by no means blind to the advantages which it held forth. â\\x80\\x9c You will surely never do the tricks ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I shall not, but the animals will,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick decisively. â\\x80\\x9cSemiramis will perform her part in the new drama to-morrow, or there will be an element introduced into the performance of a very tragic cha 172 racter, you may take my word for it.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I tell you what, young Arbour,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Tredgold with quite a burst of enthusiasm, â\\x80\\x9c I wish you was a son of my own, I do indeed ; although, I suppose, if I had happened to have had one, he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have made this offer of going among the ani 172 mals,â\\x80\\x94the feeling against lions being doubtless an here 172 ditary prejudice. If I was indeed your mother, Iâ\\x80\\x99d say this instant, â\\x80\\x98Go ; go and distinguish yourself before your suffering monarch but being only, as it were, your guardian, I say: â\\x80\\x98No; stop a bit ; think over the matter to-night. Donâ\\x80\\x99t take up the thing rashly and in a hurry ; but if in the morning, you are of the same brave mind, whyâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9d Dick was touched by this unexpected tenderness on the part of his mistress, and took her hand in his. â\\x80\\x9c Why, it certainly -would be a first-rate opening for a young man,â\\x80\\x9d added Mr. Tredgold in conclusion. â\\x80\\x9c Stuff and nonsense,â\\x80\\x9d retorted his spouse. â\\x80\\x9c Let the344 EICHABD ABSQUE; OB, young man choose for himself, and do not lure him on to what may chance to be his destruction. Let his blood be at least upon his own head, and not on ours.â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Tredgold was quite in a virtuous glow of dis 172 interestedness by this time. When selfish persons do make a self-denying proposition, and find it duly ap 172 preciated, there is often no knowing where they will stop. Mr. Tredgold began with reason to be alarmed. â\\x80\\x9cYou pig-headed old she-unicornâ\\x80\\x9d he began, as usual. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be angry,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Dick with a grave smile, â\\x80\\x9cyou need not fear that your good wife will change my purpose, I have quite made up my mind as to taking poor Eobinsonâ\\x80\\x99s place, and to-morrow morning will not alter it. Two hundred a year, then, are the terms you agree to, Mr. Tredgold !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Two hundred a year !â\\x80\\x9d reiterated that gentleman, casting up his hands. â\\x80\\x9cWhy, you are a gentleman made. What a tremendous income.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Three hundred a year is, however, a still greater one,â\\x80\\x9d responded Dick quietly. â\\x80\\x9cYou will clear that sum of money after all, your wife herself allowed.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Tredgold threw a glance at his consort which portended squalls and â\\x80\\x9cstormyâ\\x80\\x9d for the matrimonial barometer of that night. â\\x80\\x9c And then consider the Queen,â\\x80\\x9d added Dick. â\\x80\\x9c What a position would you have been placed in when the hour for the lion-hunt arrived to-morrow, without any lion-hunter !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c The crown of feathers and the new leopard-skinI THE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 345 shall both be yours,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the proprietor with a gush of generosity. â\\x80\\x9c Some persons would consider it reward sufficient to be permitted to appear before their monarch in a costume so unique and splendid. â\\x80\\x9c You wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have me put on evening dress,â\\x80\\x9d responded Dick sardonically ; â\\x80\\x9cpeople go out to dine in that, but not to be dined upon.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Donâ\\x80\\x99t talk of such a thing,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Tredgold earnestly ; â\\x80\\x9c donâ\\x80\\x99t mention it againâ\\x80\\x94thereâ\\x80\\x99s a good fel 172 low. Now that it is all settled, I feel quite sorry that you are going to risk it. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t force your inclina 172 tions, however, in any way, did I, Arbour 1 We Ã¡re very good friends, are we not, Dick ? Now, do say that. It would be so very much more comfortable to me to think that in case anything should happen ; although there is not the least chance of such a thingâ\\x80\\x94humanly speaking-â\\x80\\x94not the least. You will be perfectly certain to fasten the cage-doors after you, the first thing, will you 1 Poor Eobinson was always exceedingly careful about making sure of them. If any of the creatures got by youâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9c Or over me,â\\x80\\x9d suggested Dick smiling. â\\x80\\x9c Yes, or over you,â\\x80\\x9d continued Mr. Tredgold simply, â\\x80\\x9c and out of the cage among the people, you would never forgive yourself, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I dare say not,â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick drily. â\\x80\\x9c Consider, my dear sir, that her Majesty herself might be imperilled ; that, in such a case, it would be my duty, my privilege, as the proprietor of this estab 172 lishment, to step in and interfere, and that my nerves346 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, might fail me. The personal safety of the sovereignâ\\x80\\x94 the stability of the very government of the countryâ\\x80\\x94 are in a manner, Eichard Arbour, placed to-morrow in your hands.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I will do my best, sir â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick quietly ; â\\x80\\x9c and Tickerocandua himself could have done no more.â\\x80\\x9d With these words, and after a hearty shake of the hand from his proprietor and proprietress, the young man retired to seek that repose which was so needful a preparation for the morrowâ\\x80\\x99s work. Sleep, however, refused to visit him. Though the body of his dead friend had been removed in the meantime from the caravan, everything in the apartment reminded him of him who had perished in that very walk of life wherein his own feet were now set so stubbornly. When his thoughts escaped from that dread companionship, they fled to subjects equally engrossing if less painful. The lovely form of Lucy Mickleham flitted to and fro before his eyes, intangible and unapproachable. It was for her sake, or rather for his own sake as respected her, that he had accepted the hazardous post which had offered itself to him that evening after so terrible a fashion. As second butcher, he could not even bring himself to let her know his degraded calling ; as the Lion-tamer of Central Africa, despite the exceeding ludicrousness of the situation, there was a nobility in its personal peril which would rescue it, in her eyes, as he fondly hoped, from shame. The income was not despicable, and his sanguine mind already looked forward to its increase. He knewTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 347 how valuable his self-taught knowledge of the natures and constitutions of the beasts with which he had to deal had been and would he to his proprietor ; how well he could advise himâ\\x80\\x94and his advice would now he sought for in the first instanceâ\\x80\\x94as to what animals should be purchased and at what price, and what were failing to â\\x80\\x9c draw,â\\x80\\x9d and should he disposed of. He had already, through an unforeseen and deplorable accident, achieved a position which was, in a pecuniary point of view, a really good one. There was surely a far less unlikely chance of its future improvement. A partner 172 ship with Mr. Tredgold, and in the end a sleeping partnershipâ\\x80\\x94a retirement upon a competencyâ\\x80\\x94-such were the visions of promise that filled the youDg manâ\\x80\\x99s mind, and induced him to adopt one of the most perilous modes of life that ever fell to the lot of mortal. They were indeed nothing in themselves, hut what a bright and shining goal they led to. Each success, each amendment in his fortunes, would be to him as so many refreshing halting-places upon his toilsome road towards the hand of Lucy Micklehain. How long, how steep that might be, was not now to be consideredâ\\x80\\x94he had only just set foot upon it, and there was nothing for him but to trudge steadily on without murmuring ; only his mindâ\\x80\\x99s eye, overlooking every obstacleâ\\x80\\x94arduous steep, and bridgeless river, and windings and turnings of the way innumerableâ\\x80\\x94fixed itself not unhopefully upon the journeyâ\\x80\\x99s end. On the other hand, Eichard Arbour was by no means blind to the Quixotic character of his undertaking.348 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, He was well aware, if even the best possible good fortune should happen to him in the quickest time, if, still young and unharmed, and comparatively wealthy, he should come to demand his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s reward from good Mr. Mickleham, that Lucy might still be withheld from him by her prudent father. He could not conceal from himself that the nature of his previous occupation (that of a mere gladiator kept for the amusement of the public, and who risked his life hourly among savage beasts for gain) would militate powerfully, and perhaps fatally against him, not only with the steady-going old man of business, but with his sonâ\\x80\\x94a man, perhaps, not less sensitive to the opinion of the world, and alive to social prejudices, for all his personal sagacity, and keen sense of the weaknesses of others. Eichard Arbour, who had once sat at respectable menâ\\x80\\x99s feasts himself, and heard bells chime to church, and helped to fill a family pew, was not unaware of what Society would have to say, in the event of an ex-lion tamer of Central Africa soliciting the hand of a lady connected with an eminent commercial firm. Society and he had had not a few personal combats already, which had resulted, as usual, in the complete victory of that amazon. Dick was hoping almost against hopeâ\\x80\\x94poor fellowâ\\x80\\x94but still he was hoping ; nay, before slumber visited his eyes that night, he was doing something betterâ\\x80\\x94he was praying. Society will be astonished and probably shocked to hear it. He was praying for â\\x80\\x9c succour, help, and comfort â\\x80\\x9d against the danger of the morrow ; adopting phrases out of the Litany, just as though he had been in the habitTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 349 of paying tithe and church-rate, and had a perfect right to use them. He thoughtâ\\x80\\x94rather illogically, perhaps, and certainly with no hesitation as to whether the pas 172 sage be metaphorical or otherwiseâ\\x80\\x94of him who fought with the wild beasts at Ephesus, and was yet preserved. The Book which his dear dead mother had given to him was in his possession yet, from which an equal comfort flows to lion-tamer and church-warden. Perhaps her sainted soul was cognizant of what her son was humbly doing that night, and a joy was thereby added to the happiness of Heaven. Albeit, Society, with a shudder that shakes her crinoline, apprehends not, and trusts, in her heart of heartsâ\\x80\\x94her whalebone of whalebonesâ\\x80\\x94that â\\x80\\x9c a line will be drawn somewhere â\\x80\\x9d even there.350 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, CHAPTER THE THIRTIETH. BEFORE THE QUEEN. The Romans of old were scarcely less gratified and astonished in the persons of their Commissioners of the Paving, when that ugly gulf across the Forum was closed up by the self-sacrifice of Marcus Curtiusâ\\x80\\x94that first mounted Volunteerâ\\x80\\x94than were Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s company when they heard that Tickerocanduaâ\\x80\\x99s vacant post of danger was to be filled by Dick. Mixed with their gratification, indeed, there were some apprehensions for his safetyâ\\x80\\x94for Dick was a public favouriteâ\\x80\\x94hut these were not so strong as to overpower the desire of seeing a young gentleman in company with lions for the first time. Mr. Mopes shook his head, and only hoped the thing would turn out well for so hold a lad. Mr. Bairman rubbed his sanguinary hands, and observed drily, that the affair would be interesting in any case. Everybody thought it the height of foolhardiness that Dick should trust himself with Semiramis after what had so recently occurred, especially, too, as Mr. Tredgold himself declared such a risk to he quite unnecessary, and the ordinary entertainment of the establishmentTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 351 amply sufficient ; but Dick, since be had put bis hand to the work, was determined to â\\x80\\x9c go the whole tigress,â\\x80\\x9d and nothing less. His interview with that lady and Ajax, in their new drama, was to conclude, and his lion-hunt in Central Africa to commence the entertain 172 ment, with a space between the two of some half hour, during which the other curiosities of the menagerie were to be exhibited. The caravans were arranged in a semicircle, with the cages of the Felince in the centre, of which her Majesty could command an uninterrupted view from the opposite bank of the eourt-yard. The sloping green-sward which surrounded the enclosure on all sides was filled with spectators both numerous and select. Her Majesty, who, of course, defrayed the whole expenses, had, with her usual thoughtfulness, invited such of the Eton boys as chose to come to be witnesses of it. They clustered around the scene of attraction like bees, nor could they be prevented from tickling the noses and pulling the tails of all such animals as incautiously lay within reach of their nimble fingers. The new Tickerocandua, of course, was kept in retirement until the moment for action shoirld arrive. He had preferred to have no rehearsal of the rÃ´le ho was about to play, but to call upon the animals to perform their parts while they were yet untired and in good temper. Whatever anxiety he might have been inâ\\x80\\x94and it must be remembered that custom and knowledge had made him far more confident than when he had been the trembling guest of the lionessâ\\x80\\x94he at least betrayed none in his countenance, which was by no means the352 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, case with his proprietor, who visited his caravan for the last time before taking his own place at the foot of that portion of the grassy slope which had been reserved for the Queen and court. â\\x80\\x9cRichard Arbour,â\\x80\\x9d observed he with earnestness, â\\x80\\x9c remember that even now, at this last moment, I do not urge you to enter a single cage. For Heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake, dismiss me and my interests entirely from your thoughts, and act only according to your own wishes and feelings.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Thank you, sir,â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick smiling ; â\\x80\\x9c but that, I assure you, is exactly what I am doing. I am think 172 ing entirely of myself and my own affairs.â\\x80\\x9d He was indeed repeating â\\x80\\x9c Lucy â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9c Maggie â\\x80\\x9d to himself alternately, as though they were charms against every peril, and keeping his mind purposely fixed upon anything rather than those seven cruel beasts among whom the next few minutes must needs find him. â\\x80\\x9c And look you, Dick,â\\x80\\x9d continued Mr. Tredgold hoarsely, and mopping his perspiring brow with his pocket-handkerchiefâ\\x80\\x94for besides his terror upon Dickâ\\x80\\x99s account, he himself liad an ordeal to undergo in his approaching attendance upon Majesty, the thought of which produced copious deliquescenceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cand look you, do not hesitate to use the whipâ\\x80\\x94the butt-endâ\\x80\\x94 hard and strong, if you deem life in danger.â\\x80\\x9d He added three words in a mysterious whisper. â\\x80\\x9c Over the nose,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Dick with a grave smile. â\\x80\\x9cYes, Mr. Tredgold, I was well aware of the place upon which to hit them. I am no foolhardy boy, asTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 353 some here think, but understand what I have taken in hand, and am fully prepared for all contingencies.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c They are none of them worth less than a hundred and fifty pounds,â\\x80\\x9d quoth Mr. Tredgold ; â\\x80\\x9c and yÃ¨t 1 swear to you that I would rather lose them all than that you should die, Dick.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I believe you, Mr. Tredgold, and I thank you. I trust, too, most sincerely, that no such sacrifice may he necessary. Nevertheless, I tell you fairly, that I never intended to hesitate between the loss of my own life and that of a wild beast.â\\x80\\x9d This tone, so respectful, yet so independent, so modest, and yet so fearless, astonished Mr. Tredgold, as it would have done any man who had known Dick hi his former subordinate capacity. Under others, and in a groove wherein original action was denied to him, Dick might have been quite easily surpassed by those of his own age ; hut now that he was in a position to think and act for himself, there were few indeed who would have so well acquitted themselves. Dickâ\\x80\\x99s Avas one of those natures which hit and spur do but ruin, but which, if the rein be left loose upon the neck, rapidly develop themselves into greatness. It is doubtful whether Garibaldi himself would have been pronounced a good soldier, if he had happened to have found himself in a regiment commanded by some Earl of Cardigan. The Family Scapegrace is, of course, an always excep 172 tional character, while unhappily the post of lion-tamer, or other fitting situation, is exceptional too, and by no means always offers itself. Generally, as in Dickâ\\x80\\x99s Q 2354 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, case, it has to be sought out by the lad himself, and where there is no Maggie left at home, in that house with the shut door, for the wayward heart to turn to in its hitter moments, that lonely and unfriended search is too apt to he fatal. Between the Scapegrace and the Scampâ\\x80\\x94 the Irreclaimableâ\\x80\\x94the steps are perilously few, and there are but too many who take them at a single hound. There was, however, surely something of native nobility not altogether lost as yet in this ladâ\\x80\\x99s heart, who, on the brink of such an enterprise as his, could disclaim the undue imputation of magnanimity ; who could tell his master so ingenuously, â\\x80\\x9c This matter is my own affairâ\\x80\\x94 a totally unheroic piece of business, undertaken for my own advantage, and not yours. My life, humble as it may seem, is yet of more value to me than any amount of property which you, sir, may have invested in wild animals. Do not suppose for a moment that I shall fall an unresisting victim to two or three hundred poundsâ\\x80\\x99 worth of teeth and claws.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Tredgold regarded the young man with evident admiration. â\\x80\\x9c You are a right honest fellow, Dick,â\\x80\\x9d said he : â\\x80\\x9c there is not a man in the company whom I respect so much as I do you, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s my hand upon it. Good Heavens ! if there isnâ\\x80\\x99t the Queen ; I hear them Eton chaps a-shouting like costermongers. God bless you, Dick, and deliver you, and keep you safe.â\\x80\\x9d And off hurried Mr. Tredgold, not without great misgiv 172 ings, to the post of honour that had been thrust upon him. Dick drew on his heavy jack boots, adjusted theTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 355 new leopard-skin upon his shoulders, settled the crown of eagleâ\\x80\\x99s feathers upon his forehead, grasped his whip, and marched out of the caravan. An animating scene was before him : his Queen and her nobles formed a brilliant assemblage at no great distance, to whom he made respectful obeisance, and a vast throng of specta 172 tors intervened, whose thousand eyes were fixed upon him and upon him only ; but he saw nothing of this ; his own eyes were looking upon two absent faces mirrored within his memoryâ\\x80\\x94that of his sister and that of his love. A ringing cheer greeted him from the boys â\\x80\\x94for his gallant appearance was such as to call forth a cheer from all youthful lipsâ\\x80\\x94as well as certain depreci 172 atory remarks which schoolboys of all ranks are prone to indulge in. â\\x80\\x9c 0 my eyes, do look at his feathersâ\\x80\\x94he must have been picking a goose !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI wonder whether that is a real leopardâ\\x80\\x99s skin, or only a railway rug !â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9c Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take half-a-crown to sixpence that the lions finish him off.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s voice, too, was distinguishable with its encouraging â\\x80\\x9c Brayvo, Brayvo;â\\x80\\x9d and there was a delicate clapping of kid gloves from the vicinity of the court circle that should have nerved the heart of any man who entertained a proper appreciation of the approval of the best Circles. All that Dick heard, how 172 ever, was a clear sweet voice repeating the same words which had been spoken to him in a garden arbour years ago : â\\x80\\x9c I believe you, dear ; I trust in you. I am sure, dear Dick, that all will yet be well and happy with us in the end.â\\x80\\x9d Then, in a moment, all that he became conscious of35G EICHAED AEBOUE; OK, was that he was among seven lions with an iron gate fastened between him and his fellow-men, and that it behoved him, if he would save his life, to feel no fear of losing it. They were all roaring in chorusâ\\x80\\x94which was so far well, he knewâ\\x80\\x94and parted to left and right before his whip-lash, just as they had done before that of Ticke- rocandua of old. The largest of the lions alone seemed to have any doubt of his identity with that chieftain, and stared at him with a pertinacity which is considered in polite society to he rudeness, unless when mitigated by the medium of an opera-glass. Him, therefore, Dick seized by the mane, and set on his hind-legs at once, with forepaws resting upon his own breast, that he might enjoy a nearer view of his countenance, and he satisfied that it meant Authority and nothing less. The pose was magnificent, and drew down a thunder of applause; which, when Dick pitched the Monarch of the Forest backwards, was renewed till the courtyard rang with it. It was somewhat rough usage of his majesty ; hut Dickâ\\x80\\x99s predecessor had always done it, and he judged it safest to adhere implicitly to precedent and the programme. He next compelled the same animal, who, it is probable, began to regret his manifestation of incredulity, to take the initiative in leaping through the little hoop, an example which the others obediently followed. Then he per 172 suaded the two lionesses to mount their limited shelves, and form the background of that much admired tableau, â\\x80\\x9c the Lion Hunter reclining after the Chase ; â\\x80\\x9d after which, by what had always appeared to Dick a singular inversion of dramatic arrangement, hut which it wouldTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 357 have been probably destruction to have just then amended, followed the Chase itself. This was the most fatiguing, as well as perilous part of the whole perform 172 ance. Dick had need of all his strength, as well as his courage, to receive each of the seven mighty creatures, as with open mouths they leaped in quick succession over him. He had to shift his shoulder with extreme rapidity, lest, thickly protected though it was, the claws of each temporary occupant should strike into his flesh ; and to draw his face back with a jerk as they left its neighbourhood, lest the snap of their retreating jaws should bereave it of some prominent feature. Their fiery eyes flashed on him as they passed, like sparks from flint and steel, their hot breath scorched him as with a furnace-blast, and he was glad enough when the third revolution of lions was completed, and his panting breast and bruised left shoulder ceased to be its axis. It was a relief to him indeed to see that family of seven crowding together in one corner of the apartment, and cursing him in their voluminous lion-language, while he discharged his bulletless carbine among them as the victorious hunter of the African plains. Never had the original Tickerocandua acquitted himself with more complete success than Dick did, nor received from any audience a more enthusiastic shout of appro 172 bation. Arrived in his own caravan, he found Mr. Tredgold awaiting him, flown away from the pre 172 sence of royalty itself, to convey his congratulations in person. â\\x80\\x9c I could not help telling them, Dick, when I saw358 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, you getting on so well and pleasantly, tliat it was only your first trial, and that, in consequence of an accident, you were filling a friendâ\\x80\\x99s place among them creeturs. The whisper passed up to her Majesty herself, I do believe, and you might have heard them Eton chaps a-cheering beyond King Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s monument.â\\x80\\x9d O J O o The whole company,â\\x80\\x94represented in the person of Mr. Mopesâ\\x80\\x94expressed their delight and congratulations upon the young fellowâ\\x80\\x99s successful achievement. â\\x80\\x9c But do,â\\x80\\x9d observed that gentleman, â\\x80\\x9cjust take a glass of brandy, for you look as pale as death.â\\x80\\x9d Dick resolutely shook his head as he replied : â\\x80\\x9c Ko, my friend ; the worst part of the business is still to be got over ; and even if it were not so, as long as I hold this post, no drop of spirits shall ever cross these lips.â\\x80\\x9d He drank Mr. Mopesâ\\x80\\x99s health in a glass of water, who straightway betook himself to his elephants, who were about to exhibit their classical attitudes. There was a knock at the door, and in came Mr. Bairman, cringing. â\\x80\\x9c I congratulate you, young man ; it was a grand experiment, and has had a most fortunate termination. Permit me to shake you by the hand.â\\x80\\x9d The invitation was not a welcome one to Dick, but he was not in a humour just then to reject the friendly advances of any man. As he still held the glass, how 172 ever, which was not yet empty, he offered his left hand, which the other wrung with great heartiness. â\\x80\\x9cBut you are not out of the wood yet, Arbour,â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 359 grinned the butcher. â\\x80\\x9c You must be very careful with Semiramis.â\\x80\\x9d An execration burst from the lips of Dick in spite of himself. â\\x80\\x9c You malicious fool, do you suppose I have not calculated my chances, or wish to be reminded of my peril ?â\\x80\\x9d He spoke so wrathfully that Bairman, who was far more mean and cowardly than any animal ever caged, absolutely shivered. â\\x80\\x9cI meant nothing, my brave young man, except to warn you. You are so audacious, you are so venturesome. I thought I would offer you a little piece of prudent advice.â\\x80\\x9d Through the abject speech of the man, there glowed a lurid fire of sardonic hate, which he seemed in vain to strive to hide. â\\x80\\x9c I do not need your advice, Mr. Bairman, and cer 172 tainly not your sympathy. I saw you looking on when poor Bobinson perished, and your face did not wear one grain of human pity in it. Go to your slaughter-house, sir ; you are a cruel cowardâ\\x80\\x94go.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ay, youngster,â\\x80\\x9d replied the butcher menacingly, but taking care to lay his hand upon the door-handle, â\\x80\\x9c and go you, too, to your slaughter-house. There are two men who have met their deaths in that den already, and Semiramis only waits forâ\\x80\\x9d What Semiramis waited for the speaker was not per 172 mitted to declare, for at that identical moment Dick caught the centre of gravity of Mr. Bairmanâ\\x80\\x99s retreating body with the toe of his right jack-boot, and caused him to describe a parabola in the air instead of completing360 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, his unpleasant prophecy in the caravan. Descending with considerable violence upon the trunk of Ninus, who just then, luckily for him, chanced to he in an in 172 verted attitude, that animal resented the concussion by pouring through the injured member such a vast quan 172 tity of dirty waterâ\\x80\\x94of which he always kept a large stock on draught for offensive purposesâ\\x80\\x94as took away what little breath the discomfited butcher had got left in him ; and there he lay in the arena, like a log, for several minutes, until carried to hospital, quite unexhila 172 rated by the applause which was showered upon him by the youthful spectators, to whom his eccentric and comet-like entrance appeared but as a part of the per 172 formance. The elephantine gymnastics being over, Dick sallied forth to conclude what had, up to this point, been a most satisfactory exhibition. He opened that cage- door which last swung back upon its hinges that Tickero- canduaâ\\x80\\x99s corpse might be borne through it, amid a total silence ; for it had got about that this was his most difficult ordeal, and that the accident upon the previous dayâ\\x80\\x94the fatal extent of which was as yet unknown to the publicâ\\x80\\x94had taken place in this very den. The lion was, as usual, dozing, with his great head resting upon his forepaws ; the tigress, too, as usual, was pacing restlessly up and down the narrow space, at one time taking her feline privilege of looking at majesty â\\x80\\x94for if a cat may look at a queen, how much more may a tigressâ\\x80\\x94at another, regarding a small but plumpTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 3G1 Etonian, who stood temptingly near the bars, much as he himself would regard a cherry. They would neither of them have made two bites at their respective delicacies. â\\x80\\x9c Stop !â\\x80\\x9d thundered Dick, smiting her ladyship across her whiskers with his whip ; and she stopped accord 172 ingly, though her tail made up for its vertical cessation by increased lateral activity. â\\x80\\x9cJump!â\\x80\\x9d and she jumped at once through that double hoop, the offer of which had cost Tickerocandua his life. The whole drama, as rehearsed so often within the last three days, was acted, in short, to admiration by all three performers. The very tableau itself of the Eoyal Arms, with the tigress instead of the unicorn, was attained with perfect success. At that instant, while the Hunter stood between the twoâ\\x80\\x94with Semiramis upon his leftâ\\x80\\x94the tigress shewed her teeth ; â\\x80\\x9c grinned with 172 out laughing,â\\x80\\x9d as it was afterwards graphically described by the plump Etonian. Then she actually kissed Dickâ\\x80\\x99s hand as her lawful lord and master. With the swiftness of lightning, he corrected her for that liberty with a tap from the but-end of his whip, and she crouched down at once upon the floor like one reproved. Then Dick made his bow amid a thousand vivats, and leaving the lion, rampant, sauntered carelessly, almost disrespectfully, out of the cage, with his left hand in his breeches pocket ; ascended the steps of his own caravan, let him 172 self inâ\\x80\\x94and fainted. There was an awful gash in that hidden left hand of his where the teeth of the tigress had met through the living flesh.362 EICHAED AEBOUK ; OE, â\\x80\\x9c I will have that cursed creature shot before I sleep this night,â\\x80\\x9d quoth Mr. Tredgold furiously, as he sat with the doctor beside the wounded man. â\\x80\\x9cYou neednâ\\x80\\x99t trouble yourself, sir,â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick quietly ; â\\x80\\x9c for she is dead already. That swift little tap upon the nose had indeed put an end to the proud Semiramis. â\\x80\\x9c There was other blood beside mine upon this hand !â\\x80\\x9d continued Dick gravely : â\\x80\\x9c I saw it there when it was too late. Bairman shook hands with me with his fingers reeking from the butcherâ\\x80\\x99s shop before I entered the cage. That was what made the poor brute bite me, for the smell of such blood always drives the poor creatures to madness. If I had given my right hand to him in 172 stead of my left, I should not he now alive to say so.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Not on purpose, surely !â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Tredgold, with a shudder ; â\\x80\\x9c the man could never have done such a murderous, such a fiendish deed as that !â\\x80\\x9d Ay, hut he did, sir,â\\x80\\x9d responded Dick in a terrible voice, and with that fearsome night with the lioness in his recollection ; â\\x80\\x9c nor is it the first time that he has played with a manâ\\x80\\x99s life in that fashion.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c He is no servant of mine henceforth,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the horrified proprietor. â\\x80\\x9c You shall never set eyes on him again, I promise you.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhere is he?â\\x80\\x9d inquired the wounded man with sternness. â\\x80\\x9c It is not right that he should have planned two murders, and yet escape scathless.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c He is in hospital,â\\x80\\x9d returned the doctor, â\\x80\\x9c and by no means scathless, if he he the man who had that fallTHE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 3G3 among the elephants. He has his collar-bone and three ribs broken.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I have not given such a good kick,â\\x80\\x9d observed Dick thankfully, â\\x80\\x9c since I played at football at Messrs. Dot and Carriwunâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x94Thank you, doctor ; I think I shall be able to go to sleep now with a mind at ease.â\\x80\\x9d364 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIRST. PROFESSIONAL. The burning though negative shame which attaches to all Scapegraces, and especially distinguishes them from the good young men of their own generation, was now at least removed in the case of Richard Arbour. Dick did belong to a profession. No friend of his fatherâ\\x80\\x94well- to-do, apoplectic, and severeâ\\x80\\x94could meet him now and ask â\\x80\\x9c What he was doing for himself,â\\x80\\x9d with the previous knowledge in his respectable but malicious mind that he was doing nothing. We do remember in that epoch of our own hot youth, when, to the great scandal of our friends, we shrank from Law, and Physic, and Divinity, the dreadful trade of Arms, and the still less unmiti 172 gated horrors of a Naval life, and preferred to compose the most rejectable papers for the periodicals, how we ourselves were worried by such inquisitors. They were always persons who professed to have entertained a friendship for our deceased parent, but who did not ex- â\\x80¢ tend that privilegeâ\\x80\\x94except in the thinnest and most theoretic formâ\\x80\\x94to ourselves. They neither lent nor left us money. They confined themselves entirely to inquir-THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 365 ing what we intended to do for ourselves, with the sole object of seeing us blush and stammer, and reply that at present we had no settled prospects whatever. Goaded to madness on one occasion by a persecutor of this kind â\\x80\\x94a prebendary of a cathedral, whose own office, by the by, was a total sinecureâ\\x80\\x94we replied that our walk in life was (with many thanks to him for his obliging inte 172 rest in our fortunes) thoroughly chalked out for us, and that the naine of itâ\\x80\\x94was tight-rope dancing. With equal force, and greater truth, Dick might have now staggered any such questioner by the reply that his w T as â\\x80\\x9c lion-taming.â\\x80\\x9d As soon as his hand got well, he was formally installed into the office and emoluments of the departed Tickerocandua. The death of Semiramisâ\\x80\\x94although that lady was valued by her proprietor at upwards of two hundred poundsâ\\x80\\x94was at once forgiven him, and the more cheerfully, perhaps, because the coronerâ\\x80\\x99s jury at the inquest upon poor Eobinson had expressed their conviction that so sanguinary an animal ought to be at once destroyed. Mr. Tredgold sent his politest compli 172 ments to the foreman, and begged to assure him that the creature had been destroyed within four-and-twenty hours of the fatal occurrence ; and in return the pro 172 prietor received the eulogiums of the county press for his ready sacrifice of his private interests to the general good of the human species. â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Arbour,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Tredgold, some little time after the exhibition at the castle, but with the gracious expressions of royal approval yet ringing in366 EICHAED AEBOÃ\\x9cK ; OE, his earsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c I trust you will never be dissevered from the establishment of Tredgold, late Trimming. I hope this golden beginning may be the earnest to you of a pro 172 longed career of successful experiments.â\\x80\\x9d Dick replied that he hoped that also ; albeit with some little insincerity, for the teaching of hoop-jumping to the felinÅ\\x93 is not exactly an employment for extreme old age, nor what a sanguine mind looks forward to as the end and crown of existence. Moreover, his Lucy might scarcely like the peripatetic character of such a domicile as the caravan, even if the Earthwoman (which did not seem probable) should turn out to be a sisterly and agreeable person to share a home with. â\\x80\\x9c I am perfectly satisfied with you, Dick, perfectly satisfied,â\\x80\\x9d continued the proprietor, but at the same time casting a wistful look at the object of so complete an eulogy, â\\x80\\x9c only there are some bills here that 1 should like you to look at and say you would not mind.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTo look at them and say I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t mind,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick, â\\x80\\x9cwell, that sounds easy enough Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure. But as to putting my name to the back of themâ\\x80\\x94if that is what you wantâ\\x80\\x94why, you must be aware, Mr. Tredgold, that I am a mere man of straw â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhy, bless my life, Dick, itâ\\x80\\x99s the posting-bills 1 mean. You see, there is something in a name, what 172 ever the poet says to the contrary. Now 7 , Arbour ainâ\\x80\\x99t a name ; or leastways, not a name for a blank wall in a leading thoroughfare. Eobinson was the same, poor fellow. Eobinson would never have done for a draw for the general public. Eobinson the Invincible w 7 ouldTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 367 have sounded next kin to nonsense. The Lion-hunter of Central Africa ought to have a title, as it were, suit 172 able to that locality, eh? Now, donâ\\x80\\x99t you think so? Kichard Arbourâ\\x80\\x94you will excuse my freedom, Dickâ\\x80\\x94 is rather a foolish name. It donâ\\x80\\x99t stir your blood, like, when you see it printed, no matter how big one gets the type.â\\x80\\x9d Dick was compelled to admit that, so far as he knew, the appearance of his family name was not calculated to have an exhilarating effect upon the public. â\\x80\\x9c Exactly,â\\x80\\x9d continued Mr. Tredgold ; â\\x80\\x9c I knew you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t defend it for a moment. Now, just look at this.â\\x80\\x9d He unrolled a posting-bill of the most gigantic proportions. â\\x80\\x9c Hereâ\\x80\\x99s a conception for you ! Hereâ\\x80\\x99s a hit, although I says it as shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t say it, which, in the present juncture of circumstances, will be worth its weight in gold : Arborino the Invincible !!!!!!!!!!! If the space would have admitted of them, we would have had half a hundred notes of admiration instead of eleven. You canâ\\x80\\x99t read it, perhaps, at this short dis 172 tance; thatâ\\x80\\x99s the beauty of it. The public will have to retire half a mile off, in order to take all the letters in. That will be one of the great attractions. All the people walking backwards away from the wall in order to learn what it is all about. The principal thoroughfares will be impeded; the police will interfere; the thing will get into the papers. Arborino the Invincible will be adver 172 tised, for nothing, through the length and breadth of the368 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, land. You Be a devilish lucky fellow, Dick. I congratu 172 late you.â\\x80\\x9d It was with a rueful countenance that Dick eyed the shapeless rainbow of printâ\\x80\\x94for every letter was a different colourâ\\x80\\x94and vainly endeavoured to decipher his new and magnificent title. â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t mind?â\\x80\\x9d expostulated Mr. Tredgold earnestly. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sure you are not the man to let the establishment suffer just for want of a couple of syllables.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind much, Mr. Tredgold.â\\x80\\x9d And from that moment, to the world at large, our Dick was known as Arhorino. He became not only lion-hunter to the establishment, but presiding genius ; director, prime-minister, and factotum of the proprietor himself. In consequence of his skilful care, far fewer animals died during the winters than had been lost before. Beasts of the highest value were purchased and parted with at a word of advice from him. When, in course of time he asked of Mr. Tredgold that a certain percentage of the increased profits, derived directly from these servicesâ\\x80\\x94and exclusive of the taming departmentâ\\x80\\x94should he allotted to him, it was granted with a readiness that made him regret, perhaps, the modesty of his demand. His wants were few, his expenses trifling, and he had reasons of his own for sav 172 ing money. It was no wonder, therefore, that he soon possessed a considerable sum in hand. Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s returns were large, but he was sometimes glad of a little ready cash, and Dickâ\\x80\\x99s was always at his disposal, forTHE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. a consideration. With all this prosperity, it was credit 172 able to the young man that hard work did not grow hate 172 ful to him, or, at all events, that he was never known to shirk it. He was always ready to go through the dangerous drudgery of the lion-hunt to the minute, nor had Mr. Mopes once to spin out his lecture upon natural history because Arborino lingered in his caravan. Un 172 less, indeed, Business is to be considered a thing insepar 172 ably connected with folded papers, red tape, ugly wafer- stamps, mustiness, spectacles, and suspicion, the Family Scapegrace was turning out to be a very excellent Business man. The last dutyâ\\x80\\x94though Dick little knew it was to be the lastâ\\x80\\x94which fell to his lot while in Mr. Tred- goldâ\\x80\\x99s establishment, was one that the majority even of lion-tamers might have hesitated to perform, without disgrace, and which still fewer persons, with money in their purses, and the means of enjoying life would have undertaken. The time was autumn, and the village where the establishment was remaining for a night was not very far from that same Salterleigh, in Devonshire, where Dick had made his first acquaintance with it. The exhibition had long been closed, and Night and earliest Morning were competing in that hopeless struggle which the former still maintains in spite of so protracted an experience, when Dick was aroused from the heavy sleep which always weighed down his eyelids upon Saturday nights, by the Earthman ejaculating his usual formulae with unwonted animation, and pressing upon370 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, him, by unmistakeable signs, the loan of his how and arrows. Dick declined the weapons, hut was endeavour 172 ing to decipher his meaning, when in rushed Mr. Mopes, head foremost, with the startling information that the lions were out and the devil was to pay. â\\x80\\x9c What lions ? â\\x80\\x9d inquired Dick. â\\x80\\x9c All of â\\x80\\x99em,â\\x80\\x9d returned the natural history professor. â\\x80\\x9c Theyâ\\x80\\x99re a-wandering about the town as common as cats.â\\x80\\x9d Without waiting to attire himself completely, hut rather taking the Earthman for his model in that respect Dick was out of the caravan and in front of his cages within the minute. â\\x80\\x9c All the lions â\\x80\\x9d that were â\\x80\\x9c about the town,â\\x80\\x9d or else 172 where, were at once reduced by his personal inspection to twoâ\\x80\\x94Ajax, and another who had been put in the place of the defunct Semiramis. They had gnawed their way through the floorâ\\x80\\x94the only portion of their apart 172 ment that was not sheathed with ironâ\\x80\\x94like a couple of Baron Trencks, and were out for the night on some pleasant Devonshire ramble. In such a case, it was not likely that Mr. Tredgold would he very useful, and, indeed, upon being informed, from without, of what had occurred, that gentleman immediately rolled himsef up in his bedclothes, after the manner of a hedgehog, and so remained in a torpor of terror ; while his lady-wife, no less terrified, but thus left insufficiently provided with the same means of concealment, shut herself up, erect, in a cupboard. Neither would Mr. Mopes move in the matter, nor the Earthmanâ\\x80\\x94who was the favourite food of lions inTHE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 371 his own countryâ\\x80\\x94nor any other person in the establish 172 ment. So long as the beasts were in their natural and proper placesâ\\x80\\x94namely, their cagesâ\\x80\\x94argued the first gentleman, he, for his part, was ready to attend to them ; but since they had escaped therefrom into the world at large, they had placed themselves out of his jurisdiction : the matter resolved itself into a case of lion-hunting, wherein it was clear that lion-hunters were alone con 172 cerned, An inhabitant of the village who kept late hours had met the two animals in questionâ\\x80\\x94whom terror and his previous potations had magnified to eightâ\\x80\\x94trotting tranquilly down the little High Street, and had started off at considerable speed, and in the reverse direction to that in which he had been previously going, to in 172 form Mr. Mopes, with the whereabouts of whose lodging he happened to be acquainted. The Earthman had heard and interpreted aright the cry of exultation that Ajax had indulged himself in upon setting his foot on the land of freedom. This was all the information that Dick could glean, before he started, with a couple of long strong cords about his middle, in pursuit of the formidable truants. Early as it was, the news had already percolated through a great part of the village, the inhabitants of which, in every variety of undress, were at their upper windows beseeching Dick to take away the lions out of their land, just as the knight-errants of old were impor 172 tuned in the case of dragons and other devastating monsters. Upon his part, Dick besought the good folks, with some superfluousness, to remain within doors, and372 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, on no account to anger the creatures by missiles, or otherwise, if they chanced to return that way. The door of only one cottage was openâ\\x80\\x94left so on the previous evening in consequence of the autumnal heatâ\\x80\\x94wherein a bedridden old woman lay complaining that two of the biggest dogs she had ever seen had just been in and chased away her favourite black cat. â\\x80\\x9c Are you quite sure they were not lions ?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Dick with anxiety. â\\x80\\x9c Gad a mercy,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the old woman, â\\x80\\x9c I dunno what they was ; but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have the law on thee if thou belongst to them, and they have harmed my black cat.â\\x80\\x9d Ajax and his companion had indeed begun their holiday by giving chase to this insignificant animal, who had fled from her far-away and gigantic kindred into a neighbouring corn-field. Dick perceived the two pur 172 suers leaping up, ever and anon, above the standing crop, and the ripple of the corn over their heads as they dashed along as through their native jungles. He had a difficulty just twice as great as that of Samsonâ\\x80\\x99s before him, but one to be overcome less by the strength of Samson than by the cunning of Delilah. He had not even his trusty whip with him ; but only a heart full of courage and a handful of cords. As soon as the lions saw him, they came springing and bounding over the tall ears towards him, as though they would say : â\\x80\\x9c Here we are ! Ainâ\\x80\\x99t it jolly ? Ainâ\\x80\\x99t it prime ? Weâ\\x80\\x99ll have no more of that cage-workâ\\x80\\x94any of usâ\\x80\\x94will we ? How glad we are that you take a similar view of the matter, and have come out to play with us.â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 373 Then Dick lay down, and the unsuspecting lions with him, and having treacherously fastened the two cords to each of their four legs, respectively, he pulled them sharply together, and knotted the cords, whereby the majestic creatures were securely â\\x80\\x9c hobbled.â\\x80\\x9d Then Mr. Mopes and other brave men came with flat boards, whereupon the hampered beasts were strongly bound, and so, borne shoulder-high, though not altogether in triumph, back to their apartment, which was already securely refloored for their reception. Everybody was enthusiastic about Dickâ\\x80\\x99s courageous conduct, the very parish-clerk of the place being moved to confess that no similar feat had been performed in that neighbourhood for a series of years. Mr. Tred- goldâ\\x80\\x99s gratitude was as overpowering as his previous fears had been, and he offered a quarter-share of his proprietorship to Dick on the spot, before breakfast. Everything that morning, in short, seemed to point to the young manâ\\x80\\x99s becoming the king of lion-tamers, and enjoying a prolonged and glorious reignâ\\x80\\x94until the post came in with a letter for him. How often, at some apparently crowning point, does a change occur in menâ\\x80\\x99s fortunes ! How often, at short whist, with all the honours in oneâ\\x80\\x99s hand, and, as it seems, the game, a â\\x80\\x9c cross ruffâ\\x80\\x9d or some other unex 172 pected invention of the enemy gives them their one thing needful, the odd trickâ\\x80\\x94for the enemy, that is to say the chances of life against us, are always â\\x80\\x9c at four.â\\x80\\x9d And then how we blindly rail at the less blind Fortuna, who is doing her very best, perhaps, for us after all, and374 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, is only taking the first game away that we may win the succeeding two and the long odds ! There would have been much repining in Dickâ\\x80\\x99s heart upon the receipt of this missive, on account of the mal-Ã\\xa0-propos time at which it called him away from the menagerie, had it not brought a far deeper sorrow with itâ\\x80\\x94an apprehension for the life of her for whom alone he toiled and livedâ\\x80\\x94which overwhelmed all other thoughts. The letter ran thus :â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9c Dearest Dickâ\\x80\\x94We want you hereâ\\x80\\x94at onceâ\\x80\\x94 immediately. There is one in this house, sick even unto death, perhaps, for whom (if I know you) you would sacrifice your right hand if it could smooth the pillow better than anotherâ\\x80\\x99s ; as it can.â\\x80\\x94Your loving â\\x80\\x9c Maggie.â\\x80\\x9d This epistle was dated from the house of Mr. Mickle- ham, and left no doubt in Dickâ\\x80\\x99s own mind as to the identity of the person of whom his sister wrote so urgently. His beloved Lucy must indeed have been very ill to have excused Maggie for leaving her uncle, who, in these last days, could scarcely bear to let her out of his sight. He knew this by previous letters both from Maggie and Lucy, who had kept him informed, too, of the influence which Mr. Frederic Charlecot exer 172 cised over the House, as well as of his marriage with Maria, which had taken place some few months back. But of late there had been a long and unwonted pause in their correspondence. In a tumult of apprehension, Dick packed a few clothes together, concluded certain business arrangements with his proprietor, and was offTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 375 in a gig to the nearest railway station to catch the Sun 172 day mail. How long seemed that iron way ! IIow tardy the flight of that â\\x80\\x9cresonant steam eagle,â\\x80\\x9d which bore him, though it sped over valley and river, and dashed through rock and hill as bird could never do ! When the train was exchanged for the cab, his impatience grew to fever-heat ; he passed that portion of the jour 172 ney half inside the vehicle, half out of the window, exhorting the coachman to drive fast, and yet, when the well-known houseâ\\x80\\x94dearest to him of all dwellingsâ\\x80\\x94was in view, he durst not look at it ; for fearâ\\x80\\x94as upon that awful morning in Golden Squareâ\\x80\\x94he should find that Death had been before him. Ere the cabman could ring, however, Maggie had opened the door, and kissing him fondly, whispered the answer to that question which he dared not put. â\\x80\\x9c Yes, dearest, you are in time, thank Heaven. But you must be prepared for a great change. Will you see any one else first, or go at onceâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c At once, at once,â\\x80\\x9d cried Dick impatiently, and was hurrying up stairs to what had formerly been his dear Lucyâ\\x80\\x99s chamber, when Maggie called him back. â\\x80\\x9c Nay, this way, brother,â\\x80\\x9d said she, opening softly a door on the hall-floor ; â\\x80\\x9c our invalid is here.â\\x80\\x9d The spare room had been made the sick-room, and, in its ample bed, there lay, propped up by pillows, and weak, and wan, and white, the scarcely recognizable form of Uncle Ingram.370 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SECOND. RECONCILED. If for an instant the deep shadow of sorrow flitted from the young manâ\\x80\\x99s brow, and his breath was drawn more lightly, because his beloved one was safe and well, and another, where he had looked for her, was sick, it was for an instant only. Nothing but tender and eager pity was to be read on Richard Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s features after that first surprise. The spectacle before him might well indeed have moved a harder heart that had been more deeply wronged. Those firm, gray, flint-like eyes, wherefrom the impatient fire had often flashed, but from which no tear had been ever seen to fall, were now dull and filmy; the cheeks were ghastly and sunk; the large hands lay outside the counterpane, gaunt, thin, and motionless. An awful smile distorted one half of the face ; the other was all that was now left to represent the man, whose every muscle and lineament had been wont to play their part in setting forth the energy and strength within. By the bedside sat Mr. Mickleham, haggard and pale too, with an anxious solicitude in hisTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 377 gaze that gave place to a sorrowful smile of welcome to I)ick, and then returned intenser yet, as though he reproached himself for even that momentary oblivion of his stricken friend and master. â\\x80\\x9c You see he is not here,â\\x80\\x9d murmured the sick man peevishly, with his eyes fixed upon the newcomer. â\\x80\\x9c I knew he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t he : he never would do what he was told ; and why should he, now that I am a beggar ?â\\x80\\x9d The great strong-bearded man who had quelled lions, fell down upon his knees beside the bed, and asked forgiveness, from this powerless, half-childish fellow-creature, for all the ungrateful wilfulness and disobedience that he had shewn towards him during his past life. â\\x80\\x9cIs this my nephew Eichard ? Can it be Dick ? â\\x80\\x9d asked the old man with a quavering voice. â\\x80\\x9c Wipe my eyes, William ; the sun gets to them through the blind. Please to wipe my eyes.â\\x80\\x9d And indeed there were no dry eyes in the room when Uncle Ingram spoke those words. â\\x80\\x9c I canâ\\x80\\x99t shake hands with you, Dickâ\\x80\\x94I am a little weak from my late illnessâ\\x80\\x94but I forgive you all. You shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have put the stone in the snowball, you know ; you must see that now, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure : I hope Dempsey is going on welLâ\\x80\\x9d That name had not been mentioned in the Arbour family for more than ten years past, nor had it perhaps ever passed the old merchantâ\\x80\\x99s lips before. â\\x80\\x9c But, then,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, apologetically, â\\x80\\x9c that was nothing like the shame to the house. In all the papers, I daresay, by this time, is it not, William ?â\\x80\\x9d R 2378 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, The two male auditors were of opinion that the sick man was referring to the charge brought long ago against Dick in the case of Count Gotsuchakoff ; but Maggie made a hasty gesture of silence, and answered for Mr. Mickleham : â\\x80\\x9cYes, uncle.â\\x80\\x9d She divined that he was contrasting in his mind the respective behaviours of Eichard and Adolphus, and that his speech referred to a much later calamity, the suddenness of wdiich had brought on paralysis, and reduced him to his present pitiable condition. â\\x80\\x9cYou know all about it, I suppose, Dick,â\\x80\\x9d he went on ; â\\x80\\x9cyou must have heard it wherever you were. We are all beggars together now. Iâ\\x80\\x99m in the workhouse ; this is the doctor ; that is the nurse. I have nothing to complain of, howeverâ\\x80\\x94nothing. What right has a pauper got to complain of anything ? That is what I have always said. Adolphus plotted it allâ\\x80\\x94all : he and his friend Mr. Ch-Cli-Châ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Dearest uncle,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Maggie, â\\x80\\x9c try and sleep a little ; you are exciting yourself about things that are all past and gone.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI like to talk to Dick,â\\x80\\x9d replied the sick man, drowsily, â\\x80\\x9cthough he does wear a beard like Mr. Ch-Ch-Châ\\x80\\x9d The old man fell into one of those heavy slumbers, that are more like Death than Eepose, in a vain endea 172 vour to articulate the name of the man who had ruined him. The house of Arbour had fallen with a tremendous crash, and there had been nothing saved for the ownerTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 379 out of the ruins. The liabilities of the firm might per 172 haps be met, but that was all that could be reasonably hoped for. The mighty snowball which Mr. Ingram Arbour had toilsomely pushed before him, increasing with its every revolution, up the long hill of life, had escaped his fingers, and rolled to the bottom broken in a thousand pieces. He was well aware that that Sisyphean labour was not such as could be undertaken anew at seventy-four, and the sudden consciousness of his helplessness had been too much for his already enfeebled frame. Mr. Micklehamâ\\x80\\x99s house (for his own was inhabited at present by those become hateful to him) had been thrown open to him at once, as home and hospital, but that gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s affairs, of course, were themselves stricken by the same blow which had ruined his employer. â\\x80\\x9c I am poor enough for you now, dearest Hick,â\\x80\\x9d sobbed Lucy Mickleham, in the course of a charming interview which took place on his leaving his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s chamber : â\\x80\\x9cyou neednâ\\x80\\x99t complain any more of my being so rich. My face is my fortune, like the poor little milkmaidâ\\x80\\x99s in the song I used to sing to you, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s not half so plump nor so well worth looking at as it was â\\x80\\x94is it ? Hid you ever see such eyes ?â\\x80\\x9d She pointed with a fairy finger to the long lashes plentifully drenched with dew, and Hick replied, â\\x80\\x9cNever,â\\x80\\x9d with enthusiasm. â\\x80\\x9c We must all work now, as you do, Hick, and not be proud any more. Willy wants to do it all himself, dear fellow ; but I, for one, donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to let him. I380 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, can get seven-and-sixpence a piece for hand-screens of my own painting, such as this, at a shop I know of, and they donâ\\x80\\x99t cost me seven-and-threepence to begin with, as he pretends they do.â\\x80\\x9d It was a pretty screen, representing the usual um 172 brageous landscape, but in the background there was a hermitâ\\x80\\x99s cell, which Dickâ\\x80\\x99s eye rapturously recognised as the idealised presentment of that garden bower which had witnessed their last parting. â\\x80\\x9c That is mine,â\\x80\\x9d cried he ; â\\x80\\x9cI will give four hundred pounds for it ; that is mine for evermore ; â\\x80\\x9d and he seized the banner, albeit her little hand defended it gal 172 lantly, and only surrendered it under the dread compul 172 sion of a kiss. It was a long price to offer for the article, and one certainly much above its market value, hut Dick considered the very struggle to obtain possession cheap at the money. â\\x80\\x9c There, cried he gaily, â\\x80\\x9c we have now got something to furnish with. One cannot make a beginning too soon ; although, dearest Lucyâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94and his voice sank, and his look lost its brightness as he said itâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c although there is many a weary year, I fear, lying between you and me.â\\x80\\x9d Lucy did not answer in words, hut her face, with the sudden cloud upon it, and the raindrops gathering, spoke for her, saying : â\\x80\\x9c Alas, and is this true, love ? I thought that since we were both so poor, we might both he happy.â\\x80\\x9d It was a terrible trial to Dick to have to tell her how far asunder they were yet ; but he did tell her all, for he knew that she had a heart as brave as loving ; how that,THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 381 even as matters had stood before, it was impossible that they could have married until he had put by money enough to do so, independently of his present profession, or had attained such a partnership in Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s establishment as should do away with the necessity of the hazard of life and limb. She shuddered even to hear him talk of that. Then what, reasoned he, would be her anxiety to see him encountering such apparent perilsâ\\x80\\x94for, in reality, there was little danger, he saidâ\\x80\\x94 daily, nay, hourly ? Moreover, even if her father and brother should have consented to it, Dick himself, he owned, would no more have permitted wife of his to have accompanied the menagerie in its peregrinations, than would the Archbishops of York or Canterbury. Now, it would he mere weakness to conceal from them 172 selves, affairs were even in a still less hopeful position. Beside their own necessities, it now devolved upon him to supply those of sick and ruined Uncle Ingram â\\x80\\x9c Dearest Dick,â\\x80\\x9d assented Lucy softly, with quite a radiance of approval shining, rainbow-like, in her tearful eyes. â\\x80\\x9c And Maggie, too, our own dear, darling Maggie,â\\x80\\x9d added Dick ; â\\x80\\x9c for well I know that you would scorn to think of me, did I dream of happiness while Maggie was within the reach of the cold hand of Want.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Dearest Dick,â\\x80\\x9d sobbed Lucy once again, partly be 172 cause she approved of his sentiments, and partly because she took a great satisfaction in the mere utterance of that couple of words. Maggieâ\\x80\\x99s arms were round her as she spoke, or at least382 RICHARD arbour; oe, one of her arms, the other being in the custody of William Mickleham the younger, who accompanied her. â\\x80\\x9c I beg your pardon, brother, for eavesdropping,â\\x80\\x9d observed that gentleman laughing, â\\x80\\x9c but we only heard that concluding sentence of yours which concerned our 172 selves. It is very pleasant to be spoken of in that fashion by friends behind oneâ\\x80\\x99s back, and therefore Maggie cries about it. Lucy and she always cry when 172 ever they are very much pleased. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a part of the con 172 trariness of their feminine natures. But Dick, my boy, you see you must leave your sister out of these kind calculations of yours. She and I are one, or shall be so in a little time, I trust ; and I have always had an ex 172 cellent knack of providing for Number 1. Thank heaven, too, we shall have something over, not only for our dear father, but for others also. Let us two, however, form ourselves at once into a committee of Ways and Means, if at least Lucy can spare you. She has only been talk 172 ing to you two hours and a half at present, so it is scarcely to be expected that she can have communicated half her sentiments.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe have scarcely been half an hour ! â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Lucy with virtuous indignation. There was a tell-tale clock in the room, so that even Maggie herself was obliged to join in the mirth excited by this audacious statement. â\\x80\\x9c Well, I am sure that you and Willy,â\\x80\\x9d retorted Lucy, commencing that line of defence denominated the tu quoque, â\\x80\\x9c are often hours and hours â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c By the by, I have quite forgotten Uncle Ingramâ\\x80\\x99sTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 383 lemonade ! â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed his niece precipitately, as she ran out of the room, pursued, in her turn, by the laughter of the company. â\\x80\\x9c Of all the people who ever lived in a glass-house, Willy,â\\x80\\x9d continued his sister, â\\x80\\x9c and yet persisted in throw 172 ing stones â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c My dear Lucy,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted her brother pityingly, â\\x80\\x9c I am neither a melon nor a cucumber, and I live at Somerset House. Nobody knows what you mean, nor whom you are talking about. You will find her an excellent young person, doubtless, Dick, but flightyâ\\x80\\x94 certainly what you call flighty. With regard to business matters, however, since she is determined to remain here and be present at our conference, she had better be the first to give in her schedule of available capital. Item, a handscreenâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Willy, be quiet ! â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated Lucy, upon tiptoe, and endeavouring to close his provoking mouth with her little hand. â\\x80\\x9c A screen painted half in oil and half in water 172 coloursâ\\x80\\x94for she was crying â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ah, story-teller, what fibs !â\\x80\\x94what wicked fibs ! â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Crying all the time she was at it, just as though she had been working at an onion ; and itâ\\x80\\x99s exceedingly like â\\x80\\x94only the scene is in Brittany, she saysâ\\x80\\x94the tool-house in our back-garden, where she and you, I believe â\\x80\\x9d Here Lucy set up a scream of positive terror, and putting her fingers into her ears, ran off, as Maggie had done before her, scarlet, and left the two bread-winners to their conference upon Ways and Means.384 RICHARD arbour; or, â\\x80\\x9c The failure of the house is as had as bad can be, Dick,â\\x80\\x9d began William gravely, â\\x80\\x9cand we may just as well look upon it as though it had never existed. Now, tell me at once, my dear fellowâ\\x80\\x94in order that we may clearly see our wayâ\\x80\\x94how much, if anything, can you calculate upon contributing to the common stock per annum. How much do you now make a-year, with your bear and your hurdy-gurdy ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Just now, and in my improved position, the profits of which are only just commencing,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick modestly, â\\x80\\x9c I have something over three hundred a-year. I think, indeedâ\\x80\\x94for my own expenses, living as I do in a house on wheels, are next to nothingâ\\x80\\x94that I can easily spare that sum.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c The deuce you can !â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the government clerk, in a tone of sublime astonishment. â\\x80\\x9c Then all I have to say, Dick, is, do you happen to have a vacancy in your establishment \\\\ It is true that my own income is double yours, but then it has taken me five times the number of years to earn it.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think you would quite like my mode of life,â\\x80\\x9d returned Dick, smiling, as he pictured to himself, this scrupulously attired and rather self-complacent official amid the whirl of the lion-hunt. â\\x80\\x9c It would doubtless be as strange to you as Somerset House wrnuld be to me.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Dick,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. William Mickleham solemnly, â\\x80\\x9c you are an impostor and a humbug. You have misled the Worldâ\\x80\\x94you almost misled vieâ\\x80\\x94to consider you a half-daft neâ\\x80\\x99er-do-weel, whereas By the by, have you got any ready money in your possession, Dick ?â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 385 (â\\x80\\x9c I am not sure,â\\x80\\x9d whispered the government clerk to himself, â\\x80\\x9cthat this isnâ\\x80\\x99t all moonshine after all.â\\x80\\x9d) Dick drew out of his small carpet hag a bunch of enormous keys, a tolerably large bale of tobacco, a pro 172 spectus of his own performances for that evening at Plymouth, a drenching horn, and a bankerâ\\x80\\x99s book. His future brother-in-law watched the appearance of these various articles with an interest unmixed with wonder, until his eye lit upon this last. â\\x80\\x9c I should have been less astonished,â\\x80\\x9d murmured he aloud, â\\x80\\x9c if I had seen the fellow with the Bible itself.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I always do carry a Bible,â\\x80\\x9d said Dick simply, pro 172 ducing his motherâ\\x80\\x99s gift, and adding the volume to the heterogeneous assemblage upon the table. â\\x80\\x9c Please to draw a cheque,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. William Mickleham ; â\\x80\\x9cdo : when you have done that, the thing will have reached its climax. I am in a dream at present. It is the transformation scene of a pantomime, only reversed. You were the clown ; you are- Why, whatâ\\x80\\x99s this forâ\\x80\\x94these cheques for six and for four hundred pounds ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c The one is for Uncle Ingram ; for that money he sent to me was never mine, but lies to my account at his bankerâ\\x80\\x99s. The other is for value received,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick. â\\x80\\x9c It belongs to Lucy properly, but now itâ\\x80\\x99s yours, as her share and that of my uncle of the common expenses, past and future, of the household. I settled accounts with Tredgold yesterday, before I came away, and this was the balance in my favour.â\\x80\\x9d The unegotistic simplicity with which Dick gave SRICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, this hopeful schedule of his pecuniary affairs, and the entire absence of any consciousness that he was doing more than what was perfectly just and reasonable, filled the government clerk with an admiration that he rarely allowed himself to entertain for any man save one. â\\x80\\x9c Do you know, Dick, that I consider you one of the finest fellows with whom I have ever had the honour of shaking hands ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAh, but you should see me with my crown of feathers and my leopardâ\\x80\\x99s skin,â\\x80\\x9d returned the beast- tamer, laughing bitterly ; â\\x80\\x9c then Iâ\\x80\\x99m fine indeed.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c It will be better when we can dispense with those ornaments, certainly,â\\x80\\x9d answered the other ; â\\x80\\x9c although, indeed, they are no more to be ashamed of than the ermine of the judge or the lawn of the bishop. Even Wisdom and Piety must needs wear trappings to dazzle the crowd in this world.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Thank you, brother,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick sadly, â\\x80\\x9c for trying, for my sake, to persuade yourself of that. I cannot persuade myself of it. My dear Lucy knows the worst, thank Heaven, and is content to bide her time for me. But itâ\\x80\\x99s a dreadful thing, William, to be the Scapegrace of a family, after all.â\\x80\\x9d The young man covered his swarthy face with his hands, and groaned aloud. The government clerk, who would never have suf 172 fered his own feelings to have thus exhibited themselves in anotherâ\\x80\\x99s presence, was almost as much scandalised as touched. â\\x80\\x9c Take some water, Dick ; take some brandy andTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 387 water, my good fellow. Take a turn in the gardenâ\\x80\\x94 think of something else, if you can. Why, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a letter for youâ\\x80\\x94a letter from Franceâ\\x80\\x94which arrived this very morning an hour before yourself, only we forgot to give it to you.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Yes,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dick, recovering himself, and breaking the seal, â\\x80\\x9c I know who it comes from â\\x80\\x9d (for he forgot that no letter upon business could have possibly reached his present address) ; â\\x80\\x9c itâ\\x80\\x99s from the Jardin des Plantes, about the exchange of a giraffe for Gracious Heaven ! where is my dearest Lucy ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c In the dining-room, in your uncleâ\\x80\\x99s room, out in the tool-houseâ\\x80\\x94what does it matter where she is?â\\x80\\x94 you can tell me your news, I suppose, in the meantime. Have they elected you Emperor of the French by uni 172 versal suffrage? I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t wonder. What is it, Dick V â\\x80\\x9c Itâ\\x80\\x99s for Lucy first,â\\x80\\x9d cried Dick, in accents half choked with emotion ; â\\x80\\x9c itâ\\x80\\x99s for Lucy and Maggie first ; and no ears shall hear it before theirs.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80¢388 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, CHAPTER THE THIRTY-THIRD. THE BEGINNING OF A HONEYMOON. I have spoken of the old merchantâ\\x80\\x99s undone work as Sisyphean, and indeed the great house of Arbour had fallen much as a huge stone is toppled from the summit of a hill. There was a brief period of indecision, when it rocked, and hung, and hesitated upon the brink of the steep, and then down it went, â\\x80\\x9c knicketty knock,â\\x80\\x9d like the pebble in Carisbroolce Well. It was a case of Crisis, Crash, Crash, Crash, and Company, from the moment that Mr. Adolphus and his ingenious friend got the chief management of the concern into their own hands. One thing only had too confiding Uncle Ingram stickled for before that happened ; he had insisted that the highly connected and desirable Mr. Charlecot should, before taking any active part in the business, espouse the mature Maria ; perhaps from a shadow of suspicion that even a gentleman of his sagacity and disinterestedness might need a family tie at once to steady and to stimu 172 late him ; or perhaps from that last weakness of com 172 mercial, as well as other minds, which derives satisfaction from being connected with aristocracy. The wedding,THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 3S9 which took place at Eose Cottage, was, by the express desire of the bridegroom, as quiet and yet solid an affair as though he had been a German sovereign con 172 tracting a morganatic marriage. He was, he said; ashamed to confess that it would be useless to invite his high-born but prejudiced relatives to that interesting ceremony ; that the Faubourg St. Germain must needs be separated for the present from Darkendim Street by an impassable gulf, although he did not despair of one day carrying his wife in triumph to the ancestral arms â\\x80\\x94a merchant princess, whom it would be as absurd to\\' confound with vulgar trade, as to mix up the Earls of Zetland or Balcarres with the small-coal line. On the morning of the marriage, Uncle Ingram be 172 stowed a splendid trousseau, and the promise of ten thousand pounds after his death, upon Maria, but only her own portion of six hundred pounds for the present. The airy mirth with which Mr. Frederic Cliarlecot re 172 ceived that bagatelle of a cheque would have been worth twice the money to an actor of genteel comedy. He crumpled it up, and thrust it into an outside pocket, as though it had been driving-gloves, to the great scandal of his future uncle, and the absolute terror of Mr. John Arbour, attorney-at-law, whose sympathies were easily excited at the prospect of any bodyâ\\x80\\x99s losing money, one shilling of which might otherwise, by possible chance, have come his way. â\\x80\\x9c Six hundred pounds ! my beloved Maria,â\\x80\\x9d laughed the bridegroom merrily ; â\\x80\\x9c and I would not have had it one penny more for worlds. It charms me immensely300 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, â\\x80\\x94I like itâ\\x80\\x94it is so characteristic. What delight it would give to my lady-mother if she only knew it. â\\x80\\x98 It serves Fred right,â\\x80\\x99 she would say ; â\\x80\\x98 it is just what he deserves.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c He gave me fifty pounds, however, Frederic, beside my trousseau,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Maria apologetically, although she was by no means so tickled with the diminutiveness of her portion as was her fiancÃ©. â\\x80\\x9c Did he indeed ? Was he so generous ?â\\x80\\x9d observed the bridegroom carelessly. â\\x80\\x9cShall I carry it for you, dearest ? It will be safer with me than you.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c No, I thank you,â\\x80\\x9d returned Maria decisively ; â\\x80\\x9c I have been always accustomed to take care of my own money myself.â\\x80\\x9d Over Mr. Charlecotâ\\x80\\x99s expressive countenance there passed an angry shadow, to which the eye of even about- to-be-wedded love could not be blind. Was it then pos 172 sible, thought the lady, that this light-hearted, impulsive, brilliant being that had dropped at her feet as from the skies, had a will of his own ! It was then of the last importance that she should intimate to him at once that he was not to exercise it. An hour or two, however, was yet wanting to that ceremony, not till after which the great question of â\\x80\\x9c Who shall be master ?â\\x80\\x9d can be satisfactorily settled ; so she temporized, like a judicious general who is expecting reinforcements, and in the meantime declines the offer of battle. â\\x80\\x9c What can you want my fifty-pound note for, dearest Fred ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c To give to the postilions,â\\x80\\x9d returned that gentlemanTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 391 curtly, with a laugh that was not altogether good-natured. â\\x80\\x9cYou make as much fuss about it as though it were fifty thousand.â\\x80\\x9d A conversation likewise took place between the bridegroom and one of his new hrothers-in-law that same morning, which was not perhaps quite consonant with the ceremony that was about to unite them in the bonds of mutual relationship and confidence. Mr. John Arbour, who was not a little afraid of his high and fashionable relative, had managed to secure his coat- button, if not his attention, in the garden for a few minutes, under the pretence of needing his tasteful aid in the selection of a bouquet for Maria. â\\x80\\x9c I say, Charlecot, my dear fellow, I want to say just half-a-dozen words to you upon business â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80¢ â\\x80\\x9c Not to-day, my dear John,â\\x80\\x9d replied the bridegroom; â\\x80\\x9c surely not to-day of all days. Let four-and-twenty hours at least be devoted to Love, Champagne, Aspira 172 tions, and four horses at full gallop. The late lamented Samuel Johnson used to observe that the being whirled rapidly through the air in a post chaise was one of the most delightful of sensations ; how much more charming then must such a recreation be, when your companion in that vehicle is Beauty, Youth, and â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Yes,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the other drily, â\\x80\\x9c I daresay it is, and I sincerely hope you may find it soâ\\x80\\x94although, for the matter of that, Maria is not a chicken. But what I wanted to say to you was this, for I have been talking to Adolphus about it, and he refers me to you. Now, you know I donâ\\x80\\x99t doubt either of you in the least. I392 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, have the very highest confidence in you both, especially in you, my dear fellow ; but you must he aovare with regard to your business relations with Uncle Ingramâ\\x80\\x9d \\' â\\x80\\x9c I beg your pardon for interrupting you,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Frederic Charlecot with a sweet smile, â\\x80\\x9c but youâ\\x80\\x99re actually gathering hollyhocks. Hollyhocks are the very last flowersâ\\x80\\x94with the single exception, perhaps, of sun 172 flowersâ\\x80\\x94which are adapted for wedding boucprets. Eoses ! ah ! thatâ\\x80\\x99s much better !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I was about to say,â\\x80\\x9d continued Mr. John Arbour, in a harsh and grating tone, as though he were sharp 172 ening his voice, â\\x80\\x9c that you know, as well as I,\" that Uncle Ingram is not so wise as he used to be by a good deal, and that you and Adolphus can wind him about your little fingers. Now, I myself am a quiet contented fellow enough, but.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cA thousand pardons,â\\x80\\x9d interposed Mr. Charlecot silkily, â\\x80\\x9c but, doubtless in a moment of inadvertence, you have again gathered a couple of hollyhocks.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh, hang your hollyhocks,â\\x80\\x9d returned the other, purple with rage. â\\x80\\x9c They are not my hollyhocks, my dear Jolin,â\\x80\\x9d re 172 turned Mr. Charlecot coolly. â\\x80\\x9c As a person whose pro 172 fession must needs accustom him to use the most accurate definitions of property, your looseness of style amazes me. You are in a passion, too, rvhich renders you quite unfit for the calm discussion of business matters. What you would say, however, as far as I can gather from your excited manner, is this: you distrust â\\x80\\x94 absolutely distrust â\\x80\\x94 your own brother, and theTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 393 influence lie is able to exercise over your uncle ; and now that I am about to be made a partner in the firm, you begin to entertain a doubt even of myself, connected though I am about to be with you by the most- sacred tie. Such a suspicion is cruel and unjust in a very high degree, and pains my sensitive nature more than I can express I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t put sage in that nosegay, John, if I were you, for though a thing justly estimated for the stuffing of ducksâ\\x80\\x94thank you It pains me, I say, although, I confess, your feelings are not altogether unnatural : you would like, of course, my dear John, to be made a partner yourself.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I insist upon being made so, sir, or I will expose the whole concern. I will shew how Adolphus and yourself, for your own ends, and to the exclusion of his other lawful kindred, have practised upon an old man of waning and enfeebled powers â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThis is eloquence, genuine eloquence, my dear John, and I did not think you had it in you. 4 Waning and enfeebled powers â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94good. There he is, my good sir, leaning upon Adolphusâ\\x80\\x99s arm at this very moment. You had better go and tell him, at once, the opinion which you have formed concerning the state of his mind.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. John Arbour bit his lips, but stopped where he was. He had not yet worked himself up to such a pitch of virtuous indignation as could induce him to take a step so perilous as that. â\\x80\\x9c Now, look here, my sagacious young friend,â\\x80\\x9d con 172 tinued Mr. Charlecot candidly ; â\\x80\\x9c just listen to me. I am not a man to do an act of Quixotic friendship even394 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, for you ; but I am quite ready to benefit you, or any other fellow-creature, if you make it worth my while to do so. Your brother is strongly opposed to your being admitted into partnership with us ; I am opposed to it also, because the less number of persons there are to share certain profits, the greater are the individual gains. It is true that, in this case, the gains will in all pro 172 bability be enormous, but the tendency of the human mind is not upon that account at all the less inclined to be exclusive. Still, a paltry sum like this which I hold in my handâ\\x80\\x94some six hundred pounds, I say, in ready moneyâ\\x80\\x94if paid to-day, paid now, to meâ\\x80\\x94ridicu 172 lous as is the disproportion which it will bear to the ulterior benefits you will derive from the investmentâ\\x80\\x94 would make me take quite a different view of this matter. I would represent that view to Adolphus. Your uncle would be led to look on the thing in a new light,\" and the house of Arbour, Arbour, and Charlecot would open its paternal arms to another brother. You would not look for a lionâ\\x80\\x99s share of the profits of course, but you shall have that of a lion cubâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I have only five hundred pounds of ready money in the world, sir,â\\x80\\x9d responded the other doggedly. â\\x80\\x9cYour proposition is iniquitous and grasp â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Not grasping, no,â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated Mr. Charlecot hastily; â\\x80\\x9cwhatever you call it, John, you shall never call it grasping. Five hundred pounds paid to me by cheque this morning will do, my friend. I believe you, when you tell me you have not a penny more. I canâ\\x80\\x99t con 172 ceive, for my\\' own part, how you could have everTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 395 managed to put by so much. I am afraid you must have denied yourself many luxuries. There it is that you exclusively business men have the pull over men like me. You have such extraordinary powers of forbearance in your personal expenditures. Now, I can never deny myself anything. I canâ\\x80\\x99t do itâ\\x80\\x94and indeed I donâ\\x80\\x99t try. If I have this money, then, before I start, I pledge you my word that you shall be admitted into the concern with the rest of us. If not But why should we picture to our minds unpleasant alternatives ? You are willing, and we are agreed. This day, then, has given to me a new commercial relation, in addition to those connections by marriage whom I had already reckoned upon.â\\x80\\x9d Nevertheless, the expression upon Mr. John Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s face was not quite fraternal as he stepped in-doors to write that cheque ; while as for the wedding bouquet, he had picked it to pieces, hollyhocks and all. The happy pair departed from the cottage without any of that effusion of tears which mars so many bridals, and at the risk of being convicted of a want of delicacy, we propose to accompany them upon their blissful travel. The house in Golden Square had been placed at their service for a fortnightâ\\x80\\x94half a honey 172 moon being considered ample in the case of a bride so serious and a bridegroom so newly dedicated to com 172 merce ; and thither Mr. and Mrs. Frederic Charlecot hurried, borne upon the wings of well, it was the Limited Express, at all events, and carried them over fifty miles within the hour.396 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, To the mind of any youthâ\\x80\\x94and Mr. Charlecot was but eight-and-thirty, which is youth in the marriage market, except in the case of such impetuous lunatics as wed upon three hundred a-yearâ\\x80\\x94it surely ought to have been a pleasant and exhilarating journey. Nor do we wonder that Maria looked blacker than usual, when, upon that her nuptial morning her husband purchased the Times and Punch at the railway station, as though he conjectured the way would be a little tedious. And yet, although the bridegroom kept that broad sheet spread before his face during the greater part of the dis 172 tance, it is but fair to state, that he was by no means occupied with its contents. The fact was, he did not wish his countenance to be too nearly scrutinized by the penetrating glances of his Maria. Incredible as it may seem, in the case of one who had eleven hundred pounds in his pocket, and the prospect of untold wealth about to accrue to him, Mr. Frederic Charlecotâ\\x80\\x99s mind was far from being tranquil. It had been a blessed relief to him, when, at the commencement of the jour 172 ney, a near-sighted and nervous young clergyman had taken his place in their coupÃ©, and began the perusal of the Guardian, unconscious of the withering indignation displayed in the countenance of the bride ; and when that divine had awakened to a sense of his situation, and precipitately left the carriage at the next station, Mr. Frederic Charlecot yearned after him, as he was by no means wont to do after clerical persons. Two hours before, as was seen in the matter of the fifty-pound note, he had been half inclined to carry matters with a highTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 397 hand ; but now that the knot was tied, he seemed quite submissive, and content to play second fiddle in that just commencing matrimonial duetâ\\x80\\x94a mere slave of the ring. â\\x80\\x9c What makes you dull, my Frederic ? â\\x80\\x9d demanded Maria, as soon as the obnoxious intruder had made his escape. â\\x80\\x9c Is it possible that you have any care un 172 known to me ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo, love, certainly not ; that isâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I know, my own pet,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the lady tri 172 umphantly : â\\x80\\x9c the eye of womanâ\\x80\\x99s love can fathom deeper far than you imagine !â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Frederic Charlecot looked exceedingly uncom 172 fortable at this mysterious speech, and waited appre 172 hensively for more. â\\x80\\x9c You are thinking about your own family connec 172 tions, Frederic, and of the impediments that lie in the way of introducing them to your beloved wife.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Heavens and earth,â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated the bridegroom, wiping his forehead, â\\x80\\x9c that was the very thing I was thinking of, and nothing else.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ah, Frederic, you underrate the discernment of us poor women, no less than our independence of charac 172 ter. We are not ambitious of social elevation ; we are not influenced by mere rank and wealth. If I were in your position, small thought of inequality between us would arise in my bosom. To love and to be loved, is all we women ask ; and it is nothing to us whether the object of our affections be low or high born, so long as he is well principled and devout.â\\x80\\x9d398 RICHARD ARBOUR J OR, â\\x80\\x9c I am truly gratified, my dearest Maria, to hear you express such sentiments,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Charlecot, with an admiration such as he rarely bestowed upon Mariaâ\\x80\\x99s moral reflections. â\\x80\\x9c I, too, for my own part, care no 172 thing for these artificial distinctions. Here we are at London, howeverâ\\x80\\x94a city, by the by, teeming with such narrow and miserable prejudices. 1 have ordered a carriage and pair to meet us at the station, that we may not be mixed up with the mob of jostling cab- seekers.â\\x80\\x9d In that exclusive equipage the bride and bridegroom were whirled genteelly away to Golden Square. A maid-servantâ\\x80\\x94not the same who had attracted the young affections of Adolphusâ\\x80\\x94opened the door, and Mrs. Trimming was not, as usual, in the hall to receive the visitors. Splendidly attired, but a trifle paler than usual, that lady was nervously awaiting their arrival in the dining-room. She cast her arms affectionately around Maria, who endured her embrace with complacency, but without returning itâ\\x80\\x94precisely as if she was having a new shawl tried onâ\\x80\\x94and then, to that young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s intense horror, transferred her caresses to the cheek and shoulders of Mr. Frederic Charlecot. â\\x80\\x9c Mrs. Trimming,â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated the outraged bride, â\\x80\\x9c this is a liberty which can never be permitted to a person in your position.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c What ! Have you not told her, Dick ?â\\x80\\x9d said the old lady, reproachfully. â\\x80\\x9c Have you not had the courage to own your poor old mother ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c His mother !â\\x80\\x9d shrieked Maria, turning straw colourTHE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 399 â\\x80\\x94which was as pale as her complexion permittedâ\\x80\\x94and sinking backwards upon the sofa. â\\x80\\x9cPardon me dearest,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mr. Charlecot, or Jones, or Trimming, throwing himself on his knees beside herâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cpardon this loverâ\\x80\\x99s stratagem.

The handsomest, bravest, kind 172 est But there, I shall leave you together to make it up, which you will do all the better for the absence of an old woman like me.â\\x80\\x9d She left the room, but Maria remained perfectly still, more like a lady of distinction lying in state than a bride with her groom at her feet ; though Mr. Eichard Jones, to do him justice, was eloquent enough by this timeâ\\x80\\x94 the consciousness of having committed a felony, by marrying under an assumed name, stimulating, doubt 172 less, his desire for a reconciliation. â\\x80\\x9c To love and to be loved,â\\x80\\x9d whispered he, â\\x80\\x9c is all that I ask now, my queen. What does it matter, to use your own beautiful and touching language, dearest Maria, whether the object of our affection is of high or low degree ? It is true, I have deceived you, but no one needs to know it except yourself and my mother. I have the manners, the feelings, the capacity for busi 172 nessâ\\x80\\x94all that made up the Frederic Charlecot I assumed to be, in short, except the name.

But, hovering over the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s unattractive features as he did, not so much like a bee over a flower as a gentleman who stands upon the brink of the ice in his first skates, she suddenly started up with a shrill cry of rage, and administered such a box upon his ears, with her virgin hand, as made them ring again.TEE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 401 CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FOURTH. THE MOUSE ASSISTS THE LION-HUNTER). From the first moment that Mrs. Trimming informed her son of the disagreements in the Arbour family, and of the characteristics of the young man who would, pro 172 bably, sooner or later, succeed to his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s wealth, Mr. Richard Trimming, alias Jones, alias Charlecot, had nourished the idea of aggrandising himself at the ex 172 pense of her master. He had at first intended to intro 172 duce himself to the domestic circle by means of Dick, of whose boyish heart, as we have seen, he soon made easy conquest ; but finding that favour was not to be gained by that road, he had dropped the young gentle 172 manâ\\x80\\x99s acquaintance (until it was once more forced upon him), although, perhaps, not without some regret. Tho 172 rough scamp, indeed, and selfish profligate as this man was, he was not altogether heartless. There were more elements of good in him than in his wife or in his bro- thÃ¨rs-in-law, Adolphus and John, who would each have committed their felonies with less compunction than himself, except for the penalties which the law and society have attached to such acts. Save for that vis- s 2402 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, cous but inexplicable attachment which had existed between Maria and her eldest brotherâ\\x80\\x94a mere adapta 172 tion to double harness of that cart-rope with which they equally drew iniquityâ\\x80\\x94not one of those three had the least affection, friendship, or regard for a single fellow- creature. Now, Mr. Eichard Trimming had, in reality, certain genial sympathies, although his love for himself outweighed all other considerations wholly. He was fond of his mother, although he deceived and pillaged her ; and of Lucidora, whom he had ruined, and whose wrongs he had just put it out of his power to ever redress. Without this attraction and capacity for love, he would have been comparatively harmless. Up to that present hour, he had kept his undisputed place in the hearts of those two women, and used his influence there for ill. He had persuaded his poor doting mother, from the first, into secrecies and deceptions entirely foreign to her character, until at lastâ\\x80\\x94but always with the notion that her Eichard would be a prize to repay the fortunate possessor for anything that was lacking elseâ\\x80\\x94she had connived at his scheme of marrying her masterâ\\x80\\x99s daughter under false pretences and a borrowed name. From such a height of doting fondness did she regard him, that the wilful and eccentric motions of this Will-of-the-Wisp son of hers were, from her point of view, almost unobservable ; and the infatuated woman would scarcely have conceded a greater constancy to the polestar itself. He had so thoroughly inoculated her with that idea of his being such a â\\x80\\x9c precious high fellow,â\\x80\\x9d that she was far from surprised at his seeking an allianceTHE FAMILY SCAPECRACE. 403 iu a rank of life so superior to his own, and, not without difficulty, had been persuaded by him that any dissimu 172 lation on his part was necessary for the attainment of that object. As for Miss Maria, she was conscientiously convinced that that young lady ought to he thankful indeed. Of Lucidoraâ\\x80\\x94of whom, by the by, that other lady had never heard, and never did hear, so ignorant are we, from first to last, of the real modes of life, and springs of action, even of those who are dearest and most familiar to usâ\\x80\\x94with still greater truth than of Mrs. Trimming might it be said that she had loved not wisely hut too well. To the mother, the knowledge of the real charac 172 ter of her darling had been mercifully denied, nor did she ever behold her Richard as he was, but only a cer 172 tain splendid mirage of the man, which no familiarity nor near approach could dissipate. His mistress was doomed to learn in spite of herself how nearly allied can fickleness and fondness he ; how selfish may be the heart that is not callous, and what tortures it may de 172 signedly inflict without being cruel. Since she learned all this, and more, without learning not to love the man, it is no wonder that this woman should have been touched, as has been seen, by the sorrows of young Richard Arbour. Her first serious quarrel with Mr. Jones was upon that ladâ\\x80\\x99s accountâ\\x80\\x94when she told him of his motherâ\\x80\\x99s illness, and thereby induced him to leave the photographeeâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94and the ill treatment she received in consequence of it, doubtless augmented her interest in404 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, his future welfare. A sudden access of prosperity, for which he was indebted to Fortune, through the humble hut rapid medium of a dice-box, enabled Mr. Jones to repair to Paris, in the character of Mr. Frederic Charlecot, coincidently with the visit of Adolphus Arbour to that cityâ\\x80\\x94an opportunity thus offering itself to the Adven 172 turer, for the first time, of obtaining that young gentle 172 manâ\\x80\\x99s confidence. Their meeting in the cafÃ© was planned by the former beforehand, whose ready mind had also previously possessed itself of the most delicate intricacies of the china trade. Mr. Charlecot did not speak falsely, although he meant to do so, when he declared himself to be mentally qualified for a man of business. The bil 172 liard-sharper, menagerie-keeper, peripatetic lecturer, photographee, and gentleman of fashion, could doubtless have performed the rÃ´le of dealer in earthenware, so far as brains were concerned, as well as any other. He had in reality only adopted the speculative schemes of Adol 172 phus, although disguising them, by extension and improvement, so that their original inventor was but so far conscious of the plagiarism, as to be flattered by the consideration given to his own ideas by so great a com 172 mercial genius. Perhaps by this time Mr. Charlecot had got to believe in those plans himself, the hazardous nature of which was exactly suited to his reckless character. He certainly entertained no intention of ruining the Arbour familyâ\\x80\\x94of killiug his geese with the golden eggsâ\\x80\\x94but was anxious enough to enrich them, since by that means he enriched himself likewise. Lucidora, however, who had so often seen Mr. Jonesâ\\x80\\x99sTHE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 405 schemes miscarry, and the precious metals melt in those spendthrift hands, as soon as they reached them, was well aware of what was certain to happen to the house of Arbour if Mr. Frederic Charlecot should obtain any powerful voice in its management. She had absolutely refused to aid in his machinations, or even to remain quiescent, unless she should satisfy herself of Adolphus Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s hostility to Dick. If, when he entered that sumptuous chamber in the Hotel Gilbert, the young man had betrayed but one touch of tenderness towards his-outcast brother, it might have saved him and his house from ruin and disgrace. The infatuated woman was not such a slave to her companion that she would have let him harm the friends of the lad she loved so well and purely. But if they were not his friends ! Mr. Frederic Charlecot permitted her to assure herself upon that point, being well convinced that he might do so with perfect safety. No arguments of his own could have influenced the impulsive Lucidora so decisively against the young merchant, as that denial of the very existence of his brother heard from his own lips. From that moment, she assisted his bewitchment and subjuga 172 tion by all means within her power. She was content to remain in Paris alone and friendless, and in lodgings very different from those of the Hotel Gilbert, while Mr. Frederic Charlecot prosecuted his commercial under 172 takings at Bose cottage. He had promised her to find some opportunity of permanently befriending Diet, and of promoting meanwhile, as much as possible, his inte 172 rests, and those of his sister Maggie, with their estranged406 RICHARD arbour; or, uncle. We have seen how little this man kept his word with her in these respects, and how, forgetting what he owed to the poor girl, who had sacrificed herself, weakly and guiltily, hut still for him, he had deliberately plotted for the hand of Maggie first, and afterwards of her sister Maria. Not until the day before his marriage had he mustered courage to write and inform Lucidora of the step he was about to take. He did not attempt to exculpate himself in the least, but heaping upon his own head the sackcloth and ashes of invective, bade her at once disclose, if she pleased, his real name and position, which would only entail, he admitted, a just punishment for his perjuries and desertion in his utter and immediate ruin. Mr. Eichard Trimming did not boast himself with 172 out some reason of his knowledge of the hearts of those with whom he had to deal. Lucidora read that letter in her Parisian garret without one thought of revenge. She sat with it open in her hand, staring at it with a fixed blank gaze for hours, although the words were engraven upon her mind, and needed no reperusal. No tear welled up to her eyes ; the very fountain of tears had been trodden out by those cruel feet of his ! Dis 172 graced, deserted, guilty, the poor girl never dreamed of injuring the wretch who had thus cast her off ; not through tenderness for himâ\\x80\\x94that feeling, deep-rooted as it had been, was plucked up now, never to rise in her heart againâ\\x80\\x94but rather from her loathing of so base a creature. Her lips could not have formed his name although their doing so should have been able to blastTHE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 407 him like an evil cliarm. She shuddered as she wrote it upon the blank envelope re-enclosing that five-pound note of hisâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c all he could, unfortunately, spare at present,â\\x80\\x9d and with which he afterwards purchased a very handsome meerschaum. From that hour, she never left her atticâ\\x80\\x94where she now supported herself with her needleâ\\x80\\x94except to purchase food, and to peruse, for a few minutes every day, the English journals. She was looking for something in their Commercial Intelligence, and at last her eye encountered that it sought. Then she went home, arrayed herself in her bestâ\\x80\\x94 wherein, however, she looked like the mother of the Lucidora of a few months back, so deeply does Time set his autograph when Trouble guides his penâ\\x80\\x94and took her way to the hotel of one of the imperial ministers. This gentleman was unknown to her ; she had never even seen him ; but she had confidence that he would both give her audience, and grant her prayer. She had always heard of him as one of those few admitted to the imperial councils in whom the people also reposed a trust. The situation of a warm friend of liberty, such as he was known to be, in the court of the emperor, was strange and anomalous enough, but it was not unparalleled. His own party were understood for certain valid reasons to acquiesce in it. He by no means concealed those opinions which had at one time made him obnoxious enough to the rulers of France, but on the contrary, was supposed to give no little effect to them. Louis Napoleon, it is said, is not at all times averse to take the advice of an enemy \\\\ nor was the408 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, expedition to Italy one likely to be planned in the brain of a despot or at the suggestion of mere courtiers. Let this be as it may, however, the Count de Crespigny was an imperial minister, powerful and yet popular ; and his hotel was in consequence besieged by suitors. Pre 172 cedence being, as usual, accorded to ladies, Lucidora found herself in the presence of the count far sooner than if .she had belonged to the less privileged sex. He was seated at a massive table in the middle of a vast apartment, which to some might seem scantily furnished for the reception-room of a minister ; to others, as ad 172 mirably adapted for interviews which, although public, were not intended to be overheard by eaves-droppers. The count regarded Lucidora with a grave but kindly look, and bade her in the English tongue, be seated. â\\x80\\x9c You have a reputation for not forgetting an obli 172 gation, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said she ; â\\x80\\x9c I am come to remind you of a debt that is still left unrepaid.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c To you, madam, then I trust,â\\x80\\x9d replied the French 172 man gallantly. â\\x80\\x9c Ho, sir ; not to me. To Richard Smith, who, while an apprentice at a barberâ\\x80\\x99s near Leicester Squareâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I remember,â\\x80\\x9d interposed the count ; â\\x80\\x9c his real name was Arbour was it not ? He was acquitted on a charge of abetting the death of a certain Russian, in con 172 sequence of a representation from this country. He was an honest lad, and I have a great kindness for him. After he was released from the police court, he returned I understood, to his own friends.â\\x80\\x9dTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 409 â\\x80\\x9c He liad no friends, sir, or at least none who could help him. The murder â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c There was no murder,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the count quietly. â\\x80\\x9c The execution, then, of this Russian, and the ladâ\\x80\\x99s appearance in the police court in connection with it, were the means of the poor boyâ\\x80\\x99s ruin. His uncle and family disowned him. He has been wandering about the country ever since in the humblest employmentâ\\x80\\x94a beast-tamer in a travelling menagerie.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c And why did you not inform me of these unhappy circumstances before, madam ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Because, sir, when he had only himself to provide for, he would have preferred to have done so unassisted ; at least, I think that, with regard to yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d Lucidora hesitated and coloured. â\\x80\\x9c Pray, proceed, madam ; the poor lad had perhaps some prejudice against me.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHe loved you, sir, before theâ\\x80\\x94theâ\\x80\\x94execution of the Russian gentlemanâ\\x80\\x94the statement concerning which was put into my own hands by some unknown person at the doors of the police court ; but since that time â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c He shrunk from me, you would say, as from an assassin, or at least from an executioner. Ignorant as he was of the nature of the circumstances, I cannot blame him for that. I say to you for his ear, what I would say to no other woman livingâ\\x80\\x94but you, like him I read, are to be trustedâ\\x80\\x94that he need disturb him 172 self upon that account no longer. It so chanced that410 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, another hand than mine performed its duty upon the occasion of which we speak. I owe him that confession, at least.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c He will he truly glad to hear it, sir, I am sure. He is now in evil plight enough. The father of the young lady to whom he is engaged is reduced in circumstances by the failure of the young manâ\\x80\\x99s uncle, in whose service he was, chief clerk.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I remarked the stoppage of the house hut yesterday evening,â\\x80\\x9d said the count ; â\\x80\\x9c the name attracted me.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c If then, sir, it lies in your power, as I doubt not it does, to assist Eichard Arhour, I leave you in the con 172 fidence that he will not he forgotten.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c I thank you, madam, for your good opinion, and I should be glad to prove myself worthy of it. We have, however, hut few places, I fear, such as Englishmen can fill. You say that he has been accustomed to the care of wild animals ; well ; I will see what can he done for him. I have your address written down, madam, and you shall hear from me shortly.â\\x80\\x9d Lucidora bowed her thanks, and was about to leave the room. Her wan appearance, and face, from which all expression save that of settled melancholy had died out at once, now that her mission was ended, touched the count. â\\x80\\x9c One moment, madam,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed he with gentle 172 ness. â\\x80\\x9cYou tell me that it-was your own hand that conveyed to this young and innocent sufferer in a great cause the statement which set him free from the grasp of the law, although not, as we had vainly hoped, fromTHE FAMILY SCAPEGKACE. 411 all evil consequences. We are therefore indebted to you also. Is there nothing that can he offered in repay 172 ment?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Nothing, sir, I thank you.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Nay, madam, such disinterested suitors as yourself are so rare here, that we cannot permit them to leave us empty-handed. You have troubles, wrongs, perhaps wants of your own, madamâ\\x80\\x94am I not right ? â\\x80\\x9d No single word of kindness or of sympathy had fallen upon Lucidoraâ\\x80\\x99s ear for many a day ; she had begun to deem her heart incapable of feeling such again, so shrunk and withered it seemed to have grown within her ; hut this unexpected tenderness touched it, as Mosesâ\\x80\\x99 rod the rock in Horeb, and she sat down again on the chair from which she had risen to depart, and covered her face. â\\x80\\x9c Is poverty, madamâ\\x80\\x94and nobody has experienced more bitterly the wretchedness of being poor than he who is now speaking to youâ\\x80\\x94or any obstacle that money can remove, standing between you and happiness ? be 172 tween you, perhapsâ\\x80\\x94for I have known it to do soâ\\x80\\x94and one without whom life itself seems to you not worth living for â\\x80\\x9d She held up her hand in piteous entreaty that he should cease. â\\x80\\x9c Life is worth nothing now to me, sir,â\\x80\\x9d returned she after a little, and -her tone was even more hopeless than her words. â\\x80\\x9c When I have received this favour at your hands for Eichard Arbour, I have done with happiness.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Suppose that I find some employment for him here412 RICHARD ARBOUR J OR, in Paris, will it not be happiness for you who love him, and who by your own advocacy have obtained it, to welcome him and his bride ? When we look no more for pleasure upon our own account, it oftentimes befalls us through that which we can confer on others.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo sir, no; I would not see them for worlds. They must never know that I demanded aught for them. Through me it is, in part (although they know it not), that this last misfortune has befallen them ; and there 172 fore it is fit that through me the reparation should come. But for myselfâ\\x80\\x94for meâ\\x80\\x94I am not one to welcome to her home a bride, a wife. I shall be far away when she arrives.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c You intend to leave Paris, then,â\\x80\\x9d returned the minister. â\\x80\\x9cMay I ask whither, and in what capacity?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c All places are the same to me, sir,â\\x80\\x9d answered Luci 172 dora rising ; â\\x80\\x9c so, at least, that I meet no eyes which used to know me. I can work with my needle ; I can tend the sick ; therefore I am not one to starve. Where- ever I am, and whatever I do, however, I shall not forget the kindness of Count de Crespigny to an unknown, friendless, fallen woman.â\\x80\\x9d Upon the next morning, Lucidora received two let 172 ters, one of which concerned herself, and ran as follows : â\\x80\\x9c You say, madam, you can tend the, sick, and wish to leave Paris. The office of female sub-superintendent at the Marseille Convalescent Hospital is now vacant, and at your service. The duties and emoluments are as sub 172 joined.â\\x80\\x9d The other letterâ\\x80\\x94which was left open for her inspectionâ\\x80\\x94was official, and directed to Kichard Arbour.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 413 The first smile which had visited Lucidoraâ\\x80\\x99s lips for months, played round them as she addressed this missive to Mr. Micklehamâ\\x80\\x99s house at Kensington ; where, how 172 ever, she little guessed that Dick would he found in person.iU RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIFTH. MARRIED AND SETTLED. In spite of Mr. William Micklehamâ\\x80\\x99s impatience and sarcasms, Dick kept the contents of his letter to himself until Lucy and Maggie were both in the room to hear them. Uncle Ingram was asleep, and Mr. Mickleham the elder had taken that opportunity to leave the sick manâ\\x80\\x99s bedside for an hourâ\\x80\\x99s fresh air, or the. news would perhaps have been discussed in family conclave, since it certainly concerned them all. In that letter, than which, since the invention of letters, scarce any could have conferred a greater joy upon its recipient, was offered the post of Aide-naturaliste at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, for the young lion-tamerâ\\x80\\x99s immediate acceptance. Appended to the official document # and certain satisfactory details concerning salary and house- accommodation, there were a few sentences written in a hand which Dick remembered to have somewhere seen before : â\\x80\\x9c I write these few lines after visiting your new home, as I hope it will he, my brave young sir. It seems to me pleasant enough, and one to which no young gentleman need he ashamed to bring his hride. The sitting-rooms areTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 415 certainly preferable to the saloons of Monsieur Tipsaway which you and I recollect so well. As soon as you arrive in Paris, it is my wish to welcome you and yours with this handâ\\x80\\x94which is as stainless as your own. â\\x80\\x9c De Crespigny.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c What the deuce does he mean by stainless ?â\\x80\\x9d in 172 quired Mr. William Mickleham, in secret, perhaps, a little outraged at the prospect of Dickâ\\x80\\x99s entering the respectable guild of government officials. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s only his French way of expressing himself,â\\x80\\x9d explained Richard, half-smothered by the sudden em 172 braces of the two young ladies. How they hung around his neck and cried for joy, and smiling through their tears looked all the lovelierâ\\x80\\x94like landscapes in the shower while the sun shines! How near, now, after all, was that great happiness which had a few minutes before seemed so far distant, without one sign however smallâ\\x80\\x94like the cloud out of the sea that was but as a manâ\\x80\\x99s handâ\\x80\\x94to toll of its propinquity ! How thankful they all were ! â\\x80\\x9c How I wish dear papa was in !â\\x80\\x9d cried Lucy, â\\x80\\x9cthat he might share our joy ! He is miserable enough just now, I feiir ; for he is gone to Darkendim Street, where the sale begins to-day.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Then let us go there, too,â\\x80\\x9d cried Dick ; and in five minutes the two young people were away together. Never before had Mr. Richard Arbour so appreciated a walk to the city ; never had the warehouseâ\\x80\\x94tushâ\\x80\\x94 never had that bower in Darkendim Street appeared one-tenth part so beautiful and attractive. There were,416 RICHARD ARBOUR; OR, however, certain material changes in its aspect, as well as that ideal metamorphosis into the Halls of Dazzling Light which the wand of love has power to effect even in the most unpromising localities. The sombre street was thronged with an unwonted population. A great tide of people swept in through Uncle Ingramâ\\x80\\x99s door 172 ways, without the breakwater of a single clerk or ware 172 houseman to check the babbling waves. In vain the gigantic crates, bursting with hay as usual, opposed themselves like a volunteer barricade to the invaders. They surged up the narrow staircase that led to that abode of vertu, the pattern-room, with the indecent haste of votaries of the Temple of Vice. Connoisseurs, dealers, dilettanti, dowagers with a mania for china dragons and monsters such as ordinary clay, one hopes, would shrink from forming, were pouring into that sacred chamber where Mr. Mickleham had erst been wont to sit, surrounded by his gods of clay and porcelain. Perched at the very desk from which the old gentleman had first smiled a welcome to Dick, was an auctioneer, expatiating upon the rarity of each article as he took it down from its hook. There was one face in that eager crowd, the unspeakable w oe and indignation\\' of which at once rivetted the attention of the two newcomersâ\\x80\\x94 that of Mr. Mickleham himself, who was standing immediately beneath the rostrum, with the expression of one whose children were being sold into captivity to savages before his eyes. Whenever the auctioneer began to speak, this gentleman put his fingers into his ears, and kept them there until he saw the hammer broughtTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 417 down upon the wood, and thereby knew that the fate of the precious relic was sealed, and the torture for that time over. Dick and Lucy took some time to get at him through the throng, but he never looked round ; and when they reached him, she had to grasp his arm before she could attract his notice. â\\x80\\x9c My dear child, my dear Dick,â\\x80\\x9d cried he, â\\x80\\x9c is not this terrible? I positively cannot listen to the Yandal. It is my belief that he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know Staffordshire from Meissen ware. The Babylon brick, sir, was given away to one of these idiots for four pounds fifteen. 0 Dick, Dick, it is an awful thing to be poor, let the divines say what they will.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s priceless : itâ\\x80\\x99s worth fifty pounds to any man, and to me five hundred. Itâ\\x80\\x99s Bottcherâ\\x80\\x99s own handiwork, and yet that fellow is going to pass it round among these sacrilegious bunglers, whose fingers are Good heavens ! I thought that Jew-pedlar-looking fellow yonder must have dropped it ; this is worse than watching a man upon the tight rope seventy feet over oneâ\\x80\\x99s head. He is actually scratching the bridge of his Hebrew nose with it. To what base uses may not adversity bring the best of us. What an awful example of reckless trading, Master Bichard, is this dayâ\\x80\\x99s work ! Now the man418 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, with the hammer has got it again, and is about to blas 172 pheme that jewel with his ignorant tongue. Excuse me, hut Iâ\\x80\\x99m deaf till itâ\\x80\\x99s over.â\\x80\\x9d And Mr. Mickleham again preserved his ears from outrage by putting his fingers into them. â\\x80\\x9c Five, ten, fifteen, sixteenâ\\x80\\x94thank youâ\\x80\\x94sixteen ten ; no advance on sixteen ten ; sixteen ten for this exquisite piece of white porcelain; seventeenâ\\x80\\x94thank you, sir; you have an eye, I see (to Dick), for worth and rarity. Going, going ; no advance on seventeen pounds ; then, goneâ\\x80\\x9d And Dickâ\\x80\\x99s address was handed up to the auctioneer. â\\x80\\x9cWhat did it go at?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Mr. Mickleham peevishly, not even looking round to see who was the purchaser, hut keeping his eyes fixed upon the departing treasure. â\\x80\\x9c At seventeen pounds ! That is robbery, sir ; rank, wicked robbery. The very handle is worth the money. He is coming on to the Chinese bottle and the Saxony vase, and he might just as well smash them with his hammer as knock them down at the prices which they will fetch to-day.â\\x80\\x9d Those two triumphs of the plastic art, as well as some others, of which the old clerk spoke with especial rapture, were similarly knocked down to Dickâ\\x80\\x99s bidding, over the very head of the unconscious Mr. Mickleham. It was cruel to keep him in ignorance of their destina 172 tion, but it would have been ruinous to have informed him at that period, since, had he known his ability to purchase them, his passionate eagerness would have raised the biddings, even if he had not insisted uponTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 419 naming some figure more consistent with what he con 172 sidered the legitimate value of the article. When, as the three walked home together, Mr. Mickle- ham was informed of the bright prospect that had sud 172 denly offered itself across the Channelâ\\x80\\x94brightest, as Dick affectionately assured him, insomuch as that he would now have a home to offer in Ms turn to that friend and father whose doors had been ever so hospitably open to himselfâ\\x80\\x94the old gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were dim 172 med with joy indeed ; but when Dick, by way of a diversion, spoke of the trick they had just been playing him, and how that all his porcelain favourites, inclusive even of the Babylon brickâ\\x80\\x94supposed to be irretrievably lost, but cunningly recovered from its short-sighted pur 172 chaser by an extra fifteen shillingsâ\\x80\\x94had been bought in on purpose to adorn the chamber to be set apart for him 172 self in their Parisian dwelling, the large rare tears began to fall down the old manâ\\x80\\x99s cheeks in a manner too attrac 172 tive for a public thoroughfare, and a cab had to be called to convey the delighted connoisseur and his children home. Little by little, very slowly but surely, Ingram Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s frame recovered from its terrible shock, and the two young people were married. As soon as they returned from their honeymoon, part of which was passed at a south-country village, in the vicinity of Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s establishment, in order that Dick might bid good-by to his old friends, his uncle removed to their home in Paris, where, amid new scenes, and out of the reach of all that could remind him of his late misfortunes,420 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, he improved more rapidly. He never, indeed, got to be the strong man that we once knew him to he, but he could move about and enjoy the sunshine in the pleasant Jardin, leaning upon Richardâ\\x80\\x99s arm, whom he never by any accident called Dick. Nobody but Maggie and Lucy, and they only by misadventure, were now, in fact, ever heard to pronounce that disrespectable monosyllable. Completely provided for, in a good social position, mar 172 ried and settled, with a nucleusâ\\x80\\x94that is to say, they had one baby when I last heard of themâ\\x80\\x94the nucleus of a family already established, Dickâ\\x80\\x99s occupation as a Scape 172 grace, it is clear, was utterly gone. Being, as he now was, Richard Arbour, Esquire, Aide-naturaliste of the Jardin des Plantes, friend of an imperial minister, one who settled the bills of his household weekly, fully eligible for the office of churchwarden (should Paris, happily for herself, ever have such a dignity to bestow), it is evident that a history with such a title as ours can proceed no further. The young gentleman himself, and one other, were perhaps the only persons who remem 172 bered, after a little, that he had ever played such a rÃ´le as that of mauvais sujet. Uncle Ingram, although what is called his â\\x80\\x9c head for figures â\\x80\\x9d was gone, often found him 172 self gravely thinking whether sujets were not sometimes made mauvais by indiscreet treatment, and asked for 172 giveness of his nephew tacitly a hundred times a-day. Only once, however, he spoke of the matter, as he and Richard were taking their accustomed walk together. â\\x80\\x9c Do you know, lad, said he, in a troubled tone, â\\x80\\x9c it was not I who sent for you when I was taken ill yonder ?THE FAMILY SCAPEGEACE. 421 I was as blind as ever. It was our dear Maggie who did that of her own noble heart. How muchâ\\x80\\x94how much I owe to her ! â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Not more than I, uncle ; not more than I, be sure. What she has given me is much, but what she has saved me from, can never be told in words. I know how precious was her help, but the greatness of the ruin from which she has preserved me, I shall never know. What quicksands, what sunken rocks I have been amongst, unseen by me, I cannot reckon ; but to have escaped the visible dangers, is cause enough for gratitude. When this unseasoned, half-decked craft was most un 172 seaworthy ; when the storm was fiercest, when the night was darkest, Uncle Ingram, her love seemed to shine down upon me like a star, and by it alone I steered.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c And you got into port, Richard,â\\x80\\x9d returned his uncle, smiling sadly, â\\x80\\x9c when the A1 clipper-ship was lost with all her cargo.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Ay, sir,â\\x80\\x9d replied the young man gravely ; â\\x80\\x9c but I reached it by the most dangerous channel, where ninety- and-nine are wrecked for one that gets safely through. I should be sorry, indeed, if my example should ever tempt another young gentleman to turn Scapegrace ; for though the North-west Passage may now and again, perhaps be adventured in safety, for practical purposes it will always be found better to go round.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c There is something to be said, however,â\\x80\\x9d observed Uncle Ingram stoutly, â\\x80\\x9c against dogmatical and self- sufficient old gentlemen.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c There is nothing to be said,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Dick,422 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, pressing the otherâ\\x80\\x99s arm as it rested on his own, â\\x80\\x9c hut how much we owe to Maggie. I thank God that she has found a husband worthy of her.â\\x80\\x9d Nephew and uncle had both the highest opinion of Mr. William Mickleham, but they did not quite think that either, although they often said it. It would have been difficult, indeed, to have found a husband worthy, in their eyes, of her of whom they spoke. The two young couples visit each other every year, and Mr. Mickleham the elder divides his time between them, living six months in London, and six in Paris. His small but snug apartment in the latter city is pro 172 vided, according to promise, with the chief of those porcelain treasures which used to surround him in Darkendim Street. There are also certain other inanimate objects preserved with equal care, and possessing no less of interest with divers members of that household. Item, the screen that was to have been parted with at that â\\x80\\x9ctremendous sacrificeâ\\x80\\x9d of seven and six, now holds its place in the little drawing-room, memorial of a less prosperous though far from hopeless time. Item, in Eichardâ\\x80\\x99s desk, along with a tiny curl from the as yet somewhat fluffy and ill-provided head of the nucleus, lies the lock of soft brown hair he stole from his Lucy when he played the barber at Miss Backboardâ\\x80\\x99s ; while not less fondly treasured by its side, is the half-crown which Maggie threw to him on that lonesome night when he crouched, a houseless wanderer, outside his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s house in Golden Square.THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 423 The pride and glory of the household furniture, however, and the especial delight of the nucleus from the time it began to â\\x80\\x9c take notice,â\\x80\\x9d is Item fourâ\\x80\\x94a magnifi 172 cent tiger-skin, which either hangs over the drawing 172 room sofa, or forms a soft and luxurious couch for the infant upon the floor. We can well imagine how, in time to come, it will he young Ingramâ\\x80\\x99s highest treat to hear his father tell of the terrible creature whose cover 172 ing this once was, and how it killed two men, and was within a very little of exterminating papa ; for this was erst the royal robe of Semiramis\\'â\\x80\\x94presented by Mr. and Mrs. Tredgold to Eichard Arbour as a marriage gift. In Mr. Mopesâ\\x80\\x99 lecture upon natural history, the most eloquent portion, now, is that peroration wherein he speaks of Arborino the Invincible ; of the feats he did, and of the beast he slew, and of how he is now officially connected with the imperial government of Trance. The memory of that tremendous tiger-queller is still fragrant among all Mr. Tredgoldâ\\x80\\x99s company, not except 172 ing the Earthman and the Earthwoman, â\\x80\\x9clowest of created human beings.â\\x80\\x9d Another lion-hunter has indeed been procured from the arid plains of Central Africa, but the striped mantle of Arborino has not, it is said, descended upon his successorâ\\x80\\x99s shoulders with much efficacy. It is fair to Mr. Erederic Charlecotâ\\x80\\x99s reputation as a man of honour to state, that the promise he made to John Arbour at Eose Cottage, regarding his admission into partnership, was kept to the letter, and that when the great crash took placeâ\\x80\\x94early as it cameâ\\x80\\x94the young424 KICHAKD ARBOUR ; OR, gentleman found himself so securely connected with the lirm that he was as irretrievably ruined as the rest. The only one of the family who were pecuniarily bene 172 fited in the end by their connection with their uncle was his nephew Dick, who, without using flattery or deceit, did secure his six hundred pounds, and might, had he chosen, have kept it. Adolphus, notwithstanding the houseâ\\x80\\x99s failure, has not altogether given up commercial pursuits ; the last news I got of him was as a peripatetic street-vendor of penny microscopes, in which interesting employment his excellent business habits will doubtless make up for his ignorance of science. He has a small income indepen 172 dent of this profession, supplied by some charitable hand, as has also his brother John ; who himself earns a tolerable livelihood, by benevolently inditing, in his beautiful clerkly hand, letters of recommendation for those who cannot write and have little merit, and excel 172 lent characters for servants who cannot procure them elsewhere. The police, however, with their accustomed harshness of epithet, entitle him a begging-letter im 172 postor. Mrs. Trimming resides with Mr. and Airs. Frederic Charlecot, whom she maintains out of her savings (with some annual assistance, in spite of all that has come and gone, from her late master), but without exercising the usual sovereignty of resident mothers-in-law ; Maria, it is whispered, being a great deal more than a match for the other two. One of the very last appeals in the new Divorce Courtâ\\x80\\x94the only one, say some ecclesiasticalTHE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. 425 persons, which has failed in its abominable objectâ\\x80\\x94was from one Frederic Charlecot, praying for protection and Separation from his wifeâ\\x80\\x94who, he was well aware, for her own sake, would not charge him with marrying under an assumed nameâ\\x80\\x94on the ground of cruelty. It was intimated to him, however, that, unless he could get proof that somebody else had supplanted him in the affections of his consort, no relief could be given to him. â\\x80\\x9c Whereupon,â\\x80\\x9d says the report, â\\x80\\x9c the applicant left the court with an air of the greatest dejection, exclaiming that in that case there was no hope for him whatever.â\\x80\\x9d I had almost forgotten to say that, soon after the birth of Ingram Arbour the younger, the most exquisite baby Uniform that was ever turned out by female fingers arrived at Mrs. Eichard Arbourâ\\x80\\x99s, without any other notification of the donor than the initial L. worked on the hem of the garment. â\\x80\\x9c Heaven knows how glad I should be to take her by the hand,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the young mother earnestly. â\\x80\\x9c Thank you, love,â\\x80\\x9d cried Eichard tenderly. â\\x80\\x9c I wish, indeed, that she would come and see what true friends are left to her.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c Perhaps it is better as it is, after all,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Mickleham the elder, with a nervous remembrance of Dickâ\\x80\\x99s lady visitor with that very unusual name at the police office. â\\x80\\x9c Stuff and nonsense, William,â\\x80\\x9d returned the other grandparent, with a touch of his ancient indignation. â\\x80\\x9c Who are we, that we should venture to make outcasts t 2426 RICHARD ARBOUR ; OR, THE FAMILY SCAPEGRACE. of our fellow-creatures, whose follies are often far more than outweighed by our own uncharity and selfishness ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c That is very true,â\\x80\\x9d answered Mr. Mickleham, with his customary submission to the opinions of his former chief.

PACK HERBERT MANNERS I THE TOWN-CRIER ; OR, A LESSON OF UNSELFISH 172 NESS 61 THE CHILDREN WITH THE INDIAN-RUBBER BALL ; OR, A LESSON OF OBEDIENCE ... 14!HERBERT MANNERS. CHAPTER I. â\\x80\\x98 I THINK I know it now,â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert Manners, jumping up from the rug, on which he had been lying full-length, with the book he was studying open on the ground, his head propped up by his hands and elbows, and his heels in the air ; â\\x80\\x98I think I have got it quite perfect at last.â\\x80\\x99 So saying, he handed the book to his mother, who was sitting close by, working, and asked her to hear him say what he had been learning. I dare say my readers will imagine it was some very difficult lesson Herbert was about to repeat, a stiff bit of history, perhaps, with quantities of dates ; or Bettsâ\\x80\\x99 geography, with its strings of names ; or French grammar, with examples and exceptions. But no ; it was nothing of all that. Neither was it spelling, nor arithmetic, nor Latin. Nothing of the kind. Now do try and guess what it was ! Nothing i2 HERBERT MANNERS. more than his part in â\\x80\\x98 Beauty and the Beast,â\\x80\\x99 which he was hoping soon to act at his grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s. There was always a grand gathering of uncles and aunts and cousins at his grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s every Christmas, and as a rule Herbert and his mother and brother were always of the party. But it had so happened this year that Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s little brother Percy had had a bad attack of in 172 flammation of the lungs, and therefore it had been impossible for him to go, and equally impossible for his mother to leave him. Under these circumstances, Mrs. Manners had proposed to Herbert to go alone ; but Herbert had totally declined to do so. Much as he wished to go, and disappointed as he was to miss the usual happy party, nothing would persuade him to leave his mother on Christmas Day. And so they had all three stayed at home. They had had a very cosy Christmas dinner in little Percyâ\\x80\\x99s room ; and after dinner they had had a tree and a bran-pie ; and it had turned out a most successful evening. But after Christmas Day was over, Mrs. Manners had tried to persuade Herbert to go to his grand 172 fatherâ\\x80\\x99s for the new yearâ\\x80\\x99s festivities. There was to be acting and tableaux vivants, and he would be much wanted ; for he was a good hand at acting, and was not a bit shy of speaking out his part clearly and well. At first Herbert had demurred, but in the end, when his mother had convinced him that it wouldHERBERT MANNERS. really give her more pleasure if he went than if he stayed, he had consented. This is why we find him with his book on the floor and his heels in the air ; for no sooner had he made up his mind to go, than he began to look for 172 ward to the idea with the greatest delight, and set to work to learn his part with all his might. From all that we have so far said of Herbert Manners, I think my readers will gather that he was a very nice boy, a good son, a kind little elder brother; affectionate, considerate, and full of kind and unselfish impulses. And so he was. He was all this, and more ; but he had his faults, and his faults were such as did not show so much at home as when he mixed with other children, who were more of his own age, and whose wishes and interests clashed more with his than did those of his mother and little brother. One of Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s greatest failings was a desire to be first. Whatever the game, he liked to be the head of it. If he played at soldiers he must be the general ; if he acted, he must have the best part. In his own home he was so circumstanced that he generally had things pretty much his own way. His brother Percy was a good deal younger than him, and therefore naturally Herbert took the lead, and Percy was quite contented to follow. Herbert did everything, of course, a little better than Percy, and Percy thought him a very fine fellow, and was always willing to be taught by him and to take his advice. 1â\\x80\\x9424 HERBERT MANNERS. Then, his mother being a widow, Herbert had her more to himself than is the case with most boys ; and she was able to give more time to him, and to his interests and pleasures, than many mothers can. So that altogether Herbert got more attention and consideration than was perhaps quite good for him. And his mother, who was quite aware of his failings, liked him to mix with other children, so that he might get a little more put on one side and contradicted and knocked about than he could be at home with only her and Percy. She did not think it good for him to be always in an atmosphere where he had so few temptations. She thought he hardly knew how much he stood in need of learn 172 ing self-control. She knew he had rather a violent temper, though he seldom showed it at home, and certainly never to her ; but still, there it was, and she was most anxious he should learn to control it before he went to school. Of course, if things always went right, and every 172 thing happened exactly as we liked, we should none of us, I suppose, ever get cross, or angry, or put out. Where there is no enemy there is no battle ; but where there is no battle there is no victory. The grandest thing is to be tempted, and to resist, and to conquer. And in the society of children of his own age, Mrs. Manners felt Herbert would have to learn to give and take, and to yield up his will to that of others, and to do what he did not like sometimes without losing his temper.HERBERT MANNERS. 5 â\\x80\\x98 Which part did you say you were to have, dear?â\\x80\\x99 she asked, as she took the book from Her 172 bertâ\\x80\\x99s hand. â\\x80\\x98 Uncle Claud did not say,â\\x80\\x99 he answered ; â\\x80\\x98but of course it will be the Beast ; so I have learnt that.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But why of course T she said ; â\\x80\\x98 the Beast is one of the principal parts.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And I am one of the principal actors,â\\x80\\x99 he said quickly. His mother raised her eyebrows, and looked at him with a quiet smile. Herbert knew what she meant, and felt a little shy. â\\x80\\x98 Well, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 he said, with a slight blush, â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to boast. It isnâ\\x80\\x99t that. But you know as well as I do that Harry never will speak out, and Dick always laughs the moment he comes on the stage, and Neville turns his back to the audience, and Johnny forgets his part, and has to be poked and pushed, and prompted so loud, that it quite spoils the effect of the play.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And what about Jem ?â\\x80\\x99 she inquired, quietly. 1 â\\x80\\x98 Ah well,â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert, rather bored, â\\x80\\x98Jem acts all right ; but then, mother, he is younger than me. and I do think I ought to have the choice.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But I donâ\\x80\\x99t think it is a question of choice at all. I think you will find your Uncle Claud will settle everything. Is he not the sta ge-manager ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, mamma, but still â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But still what ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I mean, I think I ought to have a choice, be 172 cause â\\x80\\x996 HERBERT MANNERS. â\\x80\\x98Tell me your reasons, dear. What makes you think that you, more than Jem, should have the best and favourite part ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, mamma, first because, as I said just now, I am the eldest.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How much ?â\\x80\\x99 she interrupted, with a smile. â\\x80\\x98 Only a month or two, I think.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Two whole months,â\\x80\\x99 he answered eagerly, â\\x80\\x98a week and three days. Jem and I have often counted it up together.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Two whole months,â\\x80\\x99 she repeated, â\\x80\\x98a week and three days older than Jem. Reason first. Is that the best you have to give ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ah, now you are laughing at me, mamma!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Herbert. He could not bear being turned into ridicule, especially by his mother. â\\x80\\x98 I am quite grave,â\\x80\\x99 she answered. â\\x80\\x98 Go on to the next reason.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, then, it would be rather hard not to let me have the part, when Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been working so hard at learning it, and taking so much trouble to get it perfect. Why, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 he went on, quite affected at his description of his labours, â\\x80\\x98do you know, I have spent the last hours of daylight this afternoon in learning it, when I might have been reading the new book you gave me on Christmas Day !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Poor boy !â\\x80\\x99 she said, smiling again. Herbert saw the smile, and looked rather offended. â\\x80\\x98Well, then,â\\x80\\x99 he went on, more eager than ever toHERBERT MANNERS. 7 prove his case, as he saw he was not altogether convincing his mother, â\\x80\\x98 then Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got that beauti 172 ful tiger-skin Uncle Herbert sent home. It would be the very thing for the Beast. It would be a thousand pities not to use it. Why, I dressed myself up in it this morning, and frightened the housemaid nearly into a fit by popping out behind the cupboard on the stairs. She quite screamed ; she did indeed, mother ; and she declared after 172 wards that she had thought it was a real tiger, and that she had never been so frightened in all her life !â\\x80\\x99 * I donâ\\x80\\x99t wonder,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Manners. â\\x80\\x98 It must have been most alarming. And I am truly grate 172 ful to you for not trying the experiment on me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But still, mamma, it just shows !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Just shows?â\\x80\\x99 repeated Mrs. Manners, inquir 172 ingly. â\\x80\\x98 What does it show ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, showsâ\\x80\\x94I meanâ\\x80\\x94what a capital wild- beastâ\\x80\\x99s skin it is.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I never doubted that for a moment,â\\x80\\x99 she an 172 swered ; â\\x80\\x98 and it is not so very surprising, consider 172 ing it is a real skin. But I donâ\\x80\\x99t see that that is any reason for your acting the Beast.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Why, mother dear ! donâ\\x80\\x99t you see that it would be a thousand pities not to use such a capital skin.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But,â\\x80\\x99 she rejoined, â\\x80\\x98 whether you take the part or Jem, the skin will do equally well. Of course you can lend it to him.â\\x80\\x99 Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s face grew very long, and he answered hastily :8 HERBERT MANNERS. â\\x80\\x98 That would never do. It wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t fit. 5 The next moment he would have given a great deal not to have said such a foolish thing ; for his mother laughed merrily. â\\x80\\x98And does it fit you, dear?â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98Were you measured for it ? Does it fit in every part, face and all ? And how about your tail ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Of course, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, laughing a little, but not willingly, â\\x80\\x98 of course I didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean that. But it really requires a great deal of care to stuff it out right, and make it look as if it fitted.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And how did you manage it ?â\\x80\\x99 she asked. â\\x80\\x98 I was stuffed out,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, â\\x80\\x98 with two cushions, and some sand-bags, and a shirt or two.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And couldnâ\\x80\\x99t Jem be stuffed out with two cushions, and some sand-bags, and a shirt or two ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No,â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert, decidedly ; â\\x80\\x98 he could not bear it. He would find it so dreadfully hot and stuffy. Even I could hardly breathe. Besides,â\\x80\\x99 added Herbert slowly, â\\x80\\x98 I should be afraid of the skin getting spoilt ; and itâ\\x80\\x99s mine.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Is it ?â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Herbert. â\\x80\\x98 How very odd ! Do you know, I thought it was mine. Surely your Uncle Herbert sent it to me ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, I mean itâ\\x80\\x99s mine because itâ\\x80\\x99s yours. At any rate, it isnâ\\x80\\x99t Jemâ\\x80\\x99s. The truth is, mamma, I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to lend it to him, because I want to be the Beast myself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah, weâ\\x80\\x99ve got to the true reason at last !â\\x80\\x99 said his mother. â\\x80\\x98 I am glad you have owned it to your-HERBERT MANNERS. 9 self. All your other reasons were mere excuses. Now were they not, Herbert? Answer me honestly.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, yes/ said Herbert slowly ; â\\x80\\x98 I suppose they were.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Jim being younger, your labours in learning your part, and all your objections to his having the tiger- skinâ\\x80\\x94all three reasons were no reasons at all,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Manners ; â\\x80\\x98 and so we return to the point we started from, and that was that you felt sure you were to have the Beastâ\\x80\\x99s part, and that I did not feel at all sure about it. And I most strongly advise you not only not to set your heart upon it, but to learn one or two of the other parts as well, so as to be ready for whatever turns up, and to be prepared in case the Beastâ\\x80\\x99s part is given to Jem.â\\x80\\x99 But this Herbert would not hear of doing. â\\x80\\x98 He was quiteâ\\x80\\x94quite sure,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98 that Uncle Claud would assign the Beastâ\\x80\\x99s part to him. And if not, he would not act at all. He should not care the least for any other part in the play.â\\x80\\x99 His mother said no more. She knew that boys sometimes learn more, though more roughly, from friction with other boys than from their motherâ\\x80\\x99s teaching, and so she thought she would leave him to buy his own experience. She therefore merely heard him repeat the part, and pointed out a few bits which would be improved by a little more learning. And then she went up to little Percy, leaving Herbert sitting somewhat moodily by the fire, with â\\x80\\x98 Beauty and the Beast â\\x80\\x99 in his lap.10 HERBERT MANNERS. CHAPTER II. About six oâ\\x80\\x99clock the next evening, Herbert Manners, his heart beating high with pleasure and excitement, was driving up to his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s house in the carriage which had been sent to meet him at the station. Notwithstanding his delight, however, he was feeling a little shy, for he had never in his life paid a visit without his mother before, and he did not quite know how he should feel alone among his uncles and aunts and cousins. The carriage stopped at the lodge-gate, and the gardenerâ\\x80\\x99s wife came out to open it, a pretty little girl of about six trotting out after her. The gardenerâ\\x80\\x99s wife was a very old friend of Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s ; she had known him ever since he was born. â\\x80\\x98 A happy New Year to you, Master Manners !â\\x80\\x99 she called out, as the carriage drove by. â\\x80\\x98 And howâ\\x80\\x99s your dear mamma and Master Percy ?â\\x80\\x99 Plerbert had not time to answer, but he leant out of the window as far as he could, and waved his handkerchief. â\\x80\\x98 How the little thing has grown,â\\x80\\x99 he said to himself ; â\\x80\\x98 and how pretty she looks !â\\x80\\x99 The little girl was an orphan grandchild of the gardenerâ\\x80\\x99s, and had been such a pretty baby that she had gone by the name of â\\x80\\x98 the little beauty.â\\x80\\x99 The gardener and his wife had been so proud of her that they had always spoken of her as â\\x80\\x98 ourHERBERT MANNERS. little beauty,â\\x80\\x99 and the name had stuck to her, so that she had come at last to be always called â\\x80\\x98 Beauty â\\x80\\x99 by everyone. â\\x80\\x98 How jolly it looks !â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert to himself, as he leaned out of the window to catch the first sight of the old house towards which he was being rapidly driven. Very jolly it certainly looked, standing out in the clear starlight, with lights in all its windows. It was the very picture of warmth and comfort and hospitality. The carriage drew up at the hall-door, and the footman rang a tremendous peal at the bell. At almost the same moment was heard from within a rush of eager feet and a sound of merry voices. The door was flung open, and as Herbert stepped into the house, he was instantly surrounded by a crowd of cousinsâ\\x80\\x94boys and girls of all ages and sizesâ\\x80\\x94all talking at once, all trying to shake hands with him, and all telling him something different at the same moment. 1 Come ! leave him alone !â\\x80\\x99 said a loud authori 172 tative voice ; â\\x80\\x98 donâ\\x80\\x99t tear the poor fellow to pieces. Stand back, some of you, and let him come to the fire and warm himself after his cold journey.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Uncle Claud !â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Herbert, springing joyfully forward, while the rest, falling back at once, made room for him to advance and take his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s outstretched hand. Uncle Claudâ\\x80\\x99s word was law. He was the12 HERBERT MANNERS. youngest and only unmarried uncle, and an im 172 mense favourite with all the children. â\\x80\\x98 How are you, my boy ?â\\x80\\x99 he said ; â\\x80\\x98 and how did you leave your mother ? Come along with me into the drawing-room, and pay your respects to your elders and betters. You can attend to this noisy crew afterwards.â\\x80\\x99 So saying, he led him into the drawing-room, where he was warmly received by the divers uncles and aunts who were there assembled, and by his grandfather, a fine-looking old gentleman, who kissed him affectionately, and told him he grew more like his dear mother every day. These greetings were hardly over before there came a chorus from the hall of, â\\x80\\x98Tea is ready ! tea is ready !â\\x80\\x99 and the next moment the rest of the children burst into the room. Harry, Dick, Neville, Jem, and Johnny sprang upon Herbert, and a terrific romp seemed likely to ensue. But Uncle Claudâ\\x80\\x99s voice rose above the uproar : â\\x80\\x98 Be off ! be off! No bear-fighting here, boys. This is the drawing-room remember.â\\x80\\x99 I said just now that Uncle Claud was a general favourite with all the children. And so he was. But they were also rather afraid of him. He was a man who would not stand any nonsense. He was at once the promoter of all the fun at these Christmas gatherings, the settler of all dis 172 putes, and the uncompromising law-maker. Very just, but very firm, some children would have called him strict. But indeed it was neces-HERBERT MANNERS. 13 sary to be rather firm with such a rabble of noisy childrenâ\\x80\\x94mixed families too. For, as I dare say you know a flock of cousins is much more difficult to keep in order than a flock of brothers and sisters. They are much more noisy and unmanageable, and excite each other a great deal more. In their games, too, Uncle Claud kept order. He insisted upon everyone taking turns properly, and playing the game as it ought to be played. No one was ever allowed to play unfairly, or to get out of doing what he did not care to do, if it fell to his share. There was nothing Uncle Claud was more strict about, too, than if they acted, they should go through their parts properly and do their very best. Anyone who undertook to act, and then when his turn came to go on, turned shy and refused, never heard the last of it from Uncle Claud. â\\x80\\x98 No one need act at all unless they like,â\\x80\\x99 he would say ; â\\x80\\x98 but anyone who undertakes to do so must go through his part like a man. I will have no shirking at the last, and spoiling the pleasure of the rest.â\\x80\\x99 He was very strict, too, about giggling, or speak 172 ing so that no one could hear. He did not mind these things in a beginner, or in a very young child, or perhaps at the first rehearsal ; but he would not stand it on the grand night, or in those who had acted before, or were old enough to be more sensible. â\\x80\\x98Either do a thing well, or donâ\\x80\\x99t do it at all,â\\x80\\x99 he would say. Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s acting always met with Uncle Claudâ\\x80\\x99s14 HERBERT MANNERS. approval. He knew the boy put his whole heart into his part, and did his very best. And knowing this was perhaps the reason why Herbert felt secretly convinced that the Beast part was almost certain to be given to him. Laughing, wrestling, and jostling, the children all scrambled out of the drawing-room and went into the school-room to tea. Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s place was between Neville and Jem ; and hardly were they all seated than he turned eagerly to Jem and asked him if the parts were settled for â\\x80\\x98 Beauty and the Beast.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Hush!â\\x80\\x99 said Jem; â\\x80\\x98you mustnâ\\x80\\x99t talk about it now. Half of them donâ\\x80\\x99t know we are going to act, and Uncle Claud wants it kept a secret till the day comes. Heâ\\x80\\x99s going to give us all sorts of sur 172 prises, too, when the play is over.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But how are we to learn our parts, and how are we to rehearse ?â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Herbert. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, that is all to be done to-morrow morning,â\\x80\\x99 answered Jem ; â\\x80\\x98 at least, we are to learn our parts in the morning and rehearse in the afternoon. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re quite easy to learn, you know, all in rhyme. It wonâ\\x80\\x99t take us more than an hour or so. Itâ\\x80\\x99s quite ABC. Directly after breakfast to 172 morrow, Uncle Claud is to call all he has picked out to act into the play-room ; the doors are to be locked, and then Uncle Claud will settle all the parts himself, so that there shall be no quarrelling or grumbling. So we shanâ\\x80\\x99t know till to-morrow. Do you see ?â\\x80\\x99HERBERT MANNERS. 15 â\\x80\\x98 Oh dear !â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Herbert ; â\\x80\\x98 what a bore ! I did so want to know all about it at once.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, whatâ\\x80\\x99s the good !â\\x80\\x99 laughed Jem ; â\\x80\\x98 weâ\\x80\\x99ve got all sorts of other fun for to-night.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Have we?\\' exclaimed Herbert; â\\x80\\x98what are we going to have ? Not a tree, I suppose ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No ; the tree is over,â\\x80\\x99 said Jem ; â\\x80\\x98 we had that on Christmas Eve, and a bran-pie on Christmas night. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a pity you missed all that. But your presents were sent to you, werenâ\\x80\\x99t they V â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 answered Herbert ; â\\x80\\x98 we had them on our own tree in Percyâ\\x80\\x99s room. But tell me, what are we going to do to-night ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98To-night,â\\x80\\x99 answered Jem, â\\x80\\x98is more particularly for the little ones, who are supposed to be too young to care about looking on at the acting to 172 morrow. Uncle Claud is going to show them a magic-lantern, and then they are to dance.â\\x80\\x99 Soon after this conversation, tea came to an end; and the whole party trooped off to wash and dress for the evening. Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s room was next to the nursery where Jemâ\\x80\\x99s sisters and their nursery-maid were ; and the latter came and offered to give him any help he might require. But Herbert was a helpful independent sort of boy, and he rather liked packing and unpacking and arranging his clothes. As he got ready, his head was very full of the old subject. He felt on the whole pretty well satis 172 fied that Uncle Claud would give him the Beastâ\\x80\\x99sIÃ³ HERBERT MANNERS. part, but still he wished he knew it for certain, and he longed for the moment when Uncle Claud should call them all into the play-room, and put him out of his suspense. â\\x80\\x98 I wish this evening was over,â\\x80\\x99 he sighed, as he washed his hands. The next moment he reproached himself for his selfishness in wanting the younger childrenâ\\x80\\x99s fun to be over ; and he determined not to think any more of himself and his own desires, but to devote himself entirely to helping to amuse the little ones, and make their evening go off well. Full of these good resolutions, he ran downstairs, and more than ever reproached himself for his momentary wish, when he saw the flutter of delight and excitement among the small children, who were all assembled in the hall. These all had seats im 172 mediately in front of the magic lantern ; the bigger ones were behind, and behind them again the grown-up people. Then came the servants, and the gardeners and their wives, and other people about the place. Among these Herbert soon espied the little girl from the lodge and lier grand-parents, and at his earnest entreaty he was allowed to bring the child from behind, where she was not in a good place for seeing, and to establish her near the other children in front. Little Beauty was rather shy in her new position, and clung tightly to Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s hand. Finding this, he sat down in her chair and took her in his lap. Herbert was very fond of little girls. He had onceHERBERT MANNERS. 17 had a dear little sister, who had died when she was about Beautyâ\\x80\\x99s age; and, though it was many years ago, he still remembered her fondly, and loved all little girls for her sake. Beauty was quite happy with Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s protect 172 ing arm round her, and soon forgot she had left her grandmother a\\'good way off. But she clung tightly to his hand every now and then, when anything of a bear or lion, or a particularly ugly old man, ap 172 peared upon the sheet. When the performance was over, he took her back to her grandmother, who overwhelmed him with grateful thanks for his kindness to the child, and begged him to come and pay her and Beauty a visit at the lodge whenever he could find time, which Herbert gladly promised to do. The seats were now all cleared away, the magic lantern and sheet disappeared, and the hall was lighted up from one end to another. The mechanical organ was brought in, and the bigger boys turned the handle one after another, while the little ones danced. At least they called it dancing, but it was really only jumping and running. However, they enjoyed it very much, and occasionally they tumbled down and rolled over each other, which they enjoyed even more. Afterwards came â\\x80\\x98 Grand Mufti,â\\x80\\x99 1 Blind Manâ\\x80\\x99s Buff,â\\x80\\x99 and other games of the same kind. Herbert was thoroughly tired-out when the even 172 ing was over, and was not at all sorry to find himself in his bedroom.i8 HERBERT MANNERS. But, sleepy as he was, he managed to scribble a few lines to his mother, who would, he knew, be longing to hear how he was getting on. CHAPTER III. â\\x80\\x98At last the day has come,â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert to him 172 self, as he jumped out of bed the next morning. He met Neville and Harry in the passage out 172 side, and together they all proceeded downstairs. They found Jem and Dick and Lotty(Dickâ\\x80\\x99ssister) and several others, all standing round the fire in the hall, talking eagerly. â\\x80\\x98 Hereâ\\x80\\x99s ago!â\\x80\\x99 shouted Dick, as they approached. â\\x80\\x98What? what?â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert and Neville together quickly. â\\x80\\x98 Whatâ\\x80\\x99s to be done now ?â\\x80\\x99 said Dick ; â\\x80\\x98 hereâ\\x80\\x99s Uncle Claud been telegraphed for to London on business, and canâ\\x80\\x99t get back till six oâ\\x80\\x99clock this evening.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Only just in time for the full dress rehearsal,â\\x80\\x99 put in Lotty ; â\\x80\\x98 and weâ\\x80\\x99ve got to settle everything and arrange everything by ourselves.â\\x80\\x99 There was a general exclamation of disgust from everybody. â\\x80\\x98 But canâ\\x80\\x99t we get hold of him before he starts ?â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Herbert, eagerly. â\\x80\\x98Just to ask him to settle about the parts ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Before he starts ?â\\x80\\x99 echoed Dick. â\\x80\\x98 Why, heâ\\x80\\x99sHERBERT MANNERS. 19 gone! Heâ\\x80\\x99s been gone ten minutes, at least. He went off by the early train.â\\x80\\x99 Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s face grew very long, and an expression of great anxiety came over it. â\\x80\\x98 What is to be done ?â\\x80\\x99 he exclaimed. â\\x80\\x98 Who is to settle about the parts ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Didnâ\\x80\\x99t he leave word with anybody?â\\x80\\x99 inquired Neville. â\\x80\\x98 Did no one see him before he started ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 He was in a tremendous hurry,â\\x80\\x99 answered Lotty, â\\x80\\x98 and hadnâ\\x80\\x99t time to settle anything. All he said was that we must arrange it all ourselves, and that he would have a full-dress rehearsal directly he came back this evening.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Did you see him yourself.\\' 5 inquired Harry. â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99she answered; â\\x80\\x98I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t downâ\\x80\\x94but Lily and Mabel did.â\\x80\\x99 Lily and Mabel were Jemâ\\x80\\x99s sisters. They in 172 stantly became great people in the general estima 172 tion. They had seen the last of Uncle Claud, and surely he must have said something more, have left some message, or given some parting directions. â\\x80\\x98What did he say, exactly? Try and remember every word,â\\x80\\x99 said Dick ; and he, Herbert, Neville, and Harry crowded eagerly round the two little girls. â\\x80\\x98 He said,â\\x80\\x99 answered Lily, r that we were to settle it our own way, and try and give the parts to those who were most likely to do them best ; and that we were to be sure not to quarrel over it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s all very well,â\\x80\\x99 laughed Neville, â\\x80\\x98 but weâ\\x80\\x99re sure to quarrel over it if itâ\\x80\\x99s left to us. We shall each want the best part, I know.â\\x80\\x99 2â\\x80\\x94220 HERBERT MAN MERS. â\\x80\\x98 Wasnâ\\x80\\x99t there anything else, Lily ? Are you sure you canâ\\x80\\x99t remember anything else ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No ; thatâ\\x80\\x99s all/remember,â\\x80\\x99 said Lily ; â\\x80\\x98perhaps Mabel may.â\\x80\\x99 Everybody turned to Mabel, and entreated her to try and remember something. â\\x80\\x98 He said Lotty was to be Beauty, because she was the tallest,â\\x80\\x99 said Mabel, â\\x80\\x98 and â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And who did he say was to be the Beast ?â\\x80\\x99 cried Herbert, Dick, Harry, Johnny, and Neville, all to 172 gether. â\\x80\\x98He didnâ\\x80\\x99t say,â\\x80\\x99 answered Mabel. â\\x80\\x98What he said was this : â\\x80\\x9c The boys must settle it between them about their parts, but Lotty must be Beauty, because sheâ\\x80\\x99s taller than either of you.â\\x80\\x9d Thatâ\\x80\\x99s all he said.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What a bore !â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Dick. â\\x80\\x98 I am sure we shall never be able to settle. What are we to do?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, if the tallest girl is to be Beauty, the tallest boy ought to be the beast,â\\x80\\x99 said Jem, who had not yet spoken, â\\x80\\x98 and that would leave it to Neville.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t see that,â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert, quickly ; â\\x80\\x98 it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t the least matter for the Beast. Heâ\\x80\\x99s on all fours.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Not all the time,â\\x80\\x99 said Neville ; â\\x80\\x98 is he on fours when heâ\\x80\\x99s the Prince, pray ?â\\x80\\x99 The rest laughed a little at the idea of a Prince on all fours; and Herbert, who could not bear being laughed at, got rather red, and felt his temper rising.HERBERT MANNERS. 21 He managed, however, to keep it down, and lis 172 tened eagerly for what would come next. â\\x80\\x98 /think,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, â\\x80\\x98 that whoever acts Beauty should choose the Beast ; sheâ\\x80\\x99s got to marry him in the end, and so she ought to have some choice in the matter.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s nonsense,â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert, breaking in hastily. He knew that Harry was Lottyâ\\x80\\x99s favourite cousin, and felt sure therefore that her choice would fall upon him. â\\x80\\x98 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s nonsense. Lotty was ill last Christmas, and didnâ\\x80\\x99t see us act ; so she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t the least know how we each act, nor which is most fit for the part ; and Uncle Claud said we were to try to give the parts to those who were most likely to do them best. Didnâ\\x80\\x99t he, Lily? Havenâ\\x80\\x99t you just said so ?â\\x80\\x99 Lily admitted that it was quite true. â\\x80\\x98And if Lotty chose,â\\x80\\x99 Herbert went on eagerly, â\\x80\\x98 she might choose the very one of us who would act the Beast worst.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, then, how are we to settle?â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Harry and Neville both at once. â\\x80\\x98 Let me arrange it,â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert. â\\x80\\x98 I know exactly how each one of us acts.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Neville, â\\x80\\x98you can try, only you mustnâ\\x80\\x99t go and take the best part for your 172 self.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Why not ?â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert, his temper again rising. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just as good a right to the best part as any 172 body else.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 That may be,â\\x80\\x99 answered Neville ; â\\x80\\x98 but I thought22 HERBERT MANNERS. you said we were to try and give the best part to the one who would act it the best.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And if I did,â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert, â\\x80\\x98I say I could act it as well as you, and better. I never turn my back to the audience like you â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Who says I turn my back to the audience ?â\\x80\\x99 said Neville, angrily. â\\x80\\x98You know you do,â\\x80\\x99 answered Herbert ; â\\x80\\x98every 172 body knows you do. Why, last year, just at the prime moment, you turned your back, and no one could hear a word you said.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I didnâ\\x80\\x99t !â\\x80\\x99 shouted Neville. â\\x80\\x98You did,â\\x80\\x99 answered Herbert. â\\x80\\x98You shut up,â\\x80\\x99said Neville, advancing with no very friendly air towards Herbert; but Mabel caught hold of him and pulled him back. â\\x80\\x98 Oh now, don\\'t begin to quarrel !â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed. â\\x80\\x98 Never mind it now. Letâ\\x80\\x99s come to breakfast and talk about it afterwards.â\\x80\\x99 At the same moment the schoolroom gong sounded, and the children all hurried off. Happily for all parties, there had been a heavy fall of snow during the night ; and the temptation to have a grand snow-balling match in the park was too great to be resisted. So, of their own accord, the children all decided to leave the ques 172 tion of the play till after luncheon, and to devote the morning to out-door amusement. The prospect of building a gigantic snow-man, to frighten every 172 body who came by, for the moment drove every other thought out of their heads. Herbert andHERBERT MANNERS. 23 Neville became friends again in the excitement of making it, and soon forgot their little huff of the morning. The snow-man was an awful creature ; certainly very tall, very fat, and the most hideous expression of countenance you ever beheld. He was crowned with a wreath of holly, made by the girls; and some of the younger children were afraid to go near him when he was finished. The boys were most unwilling to leave him, when the time came to go in to luncheon. The question of the play now became uppermost again, and directly after luncheon Herbert, Neville, Jem, Harry, Dick, Johnny, Lotty, Lilly, and Mabel retired to the play-room, and the argument was at once resumed. CHAPTER IV. â\\x80\\x98 It seems to me,â\\x80\\x99 said Lotty, â\\x80\\x98 that as both Herbert and Neville are so bent upon being the Beast, they had better draw lots, and settle it that way.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! but I want to be Beast just as much as they do,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98 And so do I,â\\x80\\x99 said Johnny. â\\x80\\x98 And so do I,â\\x80\\x99 said Dick. â\\x80\\x98 Five Beasts !â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Lotty in despair ; â\\x80\\x98what is to be done ? Why, thereâ\\x80\\x99s only Jem left for all the other parts.â\\x80\\x9924 HERBERT MANNERS. â\\x80\\x98 Suppose we all choose our parts according to our ages,â\\x80\\x99 said Dick, who was nearly eleven. â\\x80\\x98 No ; according to our heights,â\\x80\\x99 said Neville, who was taller than any of his cousins. â\\x80\\x98 Look here,â\\x80\\x99 said Lily, â\\x80\\x98 Dickâ\\x80\\x99s the eldest and Nevilleâ\\x80\\x99s the tallest. It lies between the two. Let them draw lots for it. Or stop ! to save trouble, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll say, â\\x80\\x9c Hickory, dickeroy, dockâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 This is all nonsense,â\\x80\\x99 burst out Herbert, who had been trying hard for some minutes to keep down the agitation into which listening to this discussion had thrown him. â\\x80\\x98 If it lies between any two of us, it lies between me and Jem. And Uncle Claud would say the same if he were here.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Between you and Jem,â\\x80\\x99 repeated Neville, Harry, Dick, and Johnny ; â\\x80\\x98 and why, pray ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Because,â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert, â\\x80\\x98 we are the two best actors, and you all know we are !â\\x80\\x99 This announcement was received with great indignation, and cries ofâ\\x80\\x98Who says so?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Your trumpeterâ\\x80\\x99s dead !â\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98 Well, you are a brag !â\\x80\\x99 etc. â\\x80\\x98Speak for yourself,â\\x80\\x99 said Jem. 1 1 never said I was one of the best actors.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t boast, Herbert,â\\x80\\x99 said Lotty, gravely. â\\x80\\x98It isnâ\\x80\\x99t boasting,â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert ; â\\x80\\x98 itâ\\x80\\x99s truth.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, then, all I can say is,â\\x80\\x99 said Neville, who had not at all forgiven Herbert for saying he turned his back to the audience, â\\x80\\x98 all I can say is, that if it lies between you and Jem, I say, give the part to Jem !â\\x80\\x99HERBERT MANNERS. 25 â\\x80\\x98And Iâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98And I,â\\x80\\x99 said the others. â\\x80\\x98Jem never boasts,â\\x80\\x99said Lily ; â\\x80\\x98so I say give it to Jem too.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98As far as I am concerned,â\\x80\\x99 said Jem, when the noise had a little subsided, â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99d just as soon be the King. I donâ\\x80\\x99t care about the Beast part so very particularly, as everybody seems to want it so much.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98There now,â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert, rushing forward, â\\x80\\x98 you hear what he says. He wonâ\\x80\\x99t have the part ; and so, as it lies between us two, it leaves it to me. You. canâ\\x80\\x99t any of you say a word now.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But we can !â\\x80\\x99 shouted several of them, for Her bert had sunk very much in everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s opinion, owing to his intemperate language and behaviour. â\\x80\\x98 I\\'d sooner anyone had the part than you,â\\x80\\x99 said Neville. â\\x80\\x98 Then itâ\\x80\\x99s very unkind of you,â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert, and he felt the tears rushing to his eyes, but forced them hastily back. â\\x80\\x98 Unkind !â\\x80\\x99 repeated Harry. â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t think youâ\\x80\\x99ve much to say about unkindness. It was very un 172 kind of you to say Neville turned his back to the audience. You knew quite well how much he would dislike your saying so.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And / say,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Neville, encouraged by Harryâ\\x80\\x99s taking his part ; â\\x80\\x98 / say that Harry would act the Beast much better than you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Harry V almost shouted Herbert. â\\x80\\x98Yes, Harry,â\\x80\\x99 repeated Neville, who saw Herbert was getting into a passion, and who therefore be-26 HERBERT MANNERS. came all the more provoking. â\\x80\\x98I say Harry, or Dick or Johnny, any one of them shall have the part before you, if I have any voice in the matter. And I believe, too,â\\x80\\x99 he went on, 1 that any of them would act it better than you.â\\x80\\x99 Herbert struggled hard to control himself. His eyes flashed and he clenched his hands together. But he did not succeed. He burst out, hardly knowing what he said. â\\x80\\x98 Harry do it better than me !â\\x80\\x99 he cried in a loud, angry tone. â\\x80\\x98 Dick do it better than me ! Johnny do it better than me ! What are you talking about ? What do you mean ? Why Harry never speaks above a whisper ! Dick giggles from the moment he comes on the stage till the moment he goes off it. Johnny forgets every word he is going to say, and spoils the whole thing by making the prompterâ\\x80\\x99s voice heard above everything. A nice play youâ\\x80\\x99ll have if you make any of them the Beast, indeed ! A pretty play, certainly !â\\x80\\x99 He stopped for a minute, breathless with passion, and then went on, in a louder and more angry voice than before : â\\x80\\x98 And I tell you this. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t act in such a play. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t have anything to do with it; and if I canâ\\x80\\x99t be Beast I wonâ\\x80\\x99t act at all. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t even look on. No ; not if you will go down upon your knees and beg me to. And so there! and so there! and so there!â\\x80\\x99 The grand burst of furious language was received with shouts of derisive laughter, and â\\x80\\x98 Hear, hear,â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Bravo !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Encore !â\\x80\\x99 echoed all round.HERBERT MANNERS. V No one was on his side now ; he had offended them all by his violence and his self-assertion. He stood alone, with everyone against him. They danced round him, mocking him, imitating him, singing â\\x80\\x98 And so there ! and so there ! and so there 1â\\x80\\x99 Driven almost wild with passion, he felt that in another moment he should do something that he would be sorry for afterwards, and that the only thing was for him to get away from them all as soon as possible. â\\x80\\x98 Leave me alone !â\\x80\\x99 he shouted. â\\x80\\x98 Keep off, or I shall knock somebody down !â\\x80\\x99 He hit out right and left, and for a moment they all fell back from him, alarmed at his fury. He seized the opportunity for making for the door, and before they had sufficiently recovered from their momentary panic to close around him again, he rushed out of the room, banging the door after him. Once outside the door, Herbert hardly knew what to do next. He was crying and sobbing now, and he was ashamed to show himself anywhere in the house, with his swollen eyes and wet tear-stained cheeks. If he went up to his room he would be sure to meet some of the nurses or younger children in the passages ; if he went into the schoolroom there would be Lottyâ\\x80\\x99s mademoiselle, and Lily and Mabelâ\\x80\\x99s frÃ\\xa0ulein. The drawing-rooms and library would be full, for none of the aunts and uncles28 HERBERT MANNERS. were going out this afternoon. It was snowing hard, and he had heard them say so at luncheon. Where should he go ? To stay where he was was impossible. At any moment the children he had just left might come out of the playroom in search of him, and he would sooner do anything than see them again. How forlorn he felt ! How he longed for his mother ! How he wished he was back again at home, sitting in the snug little drawing-room with her, and able to pour all his troubles into her ear ! Before he had made up his mind what to do, the very thing happened which he had most dreaded. The door of the play-room opened, and he heard them all coming after him. He had only just time to hide behind the coal-box in the inner hall, when the whole troop of children rushed by. He heard them all run across the hall, and up the chief staircase, laughing and chattering as they went, evidently on their way to his bedroom to look for him. He must be off somewhere at once. They would be down again directly, and he could well imagine how they would hunt every hole and corner till they found him. Quick as thought he stole into the outer hall, seized his wide-awake and his ulster, and, with eyes still blinded with passionate tears, and chest still heaving with angry sobs, he opened the hall-door and stepped out on to the gravel path. A gust of wind blew the door to behind him, and he was left, a poor little, angry, miserable boy, stand-HERBERT MANNERS. 29 ing alone in the cold dark evening, with the snow 172 flakes falling thick and fast upon him. CHAPTER V. LEAVING Herbert in the snow, we will return to the warmth of the house he had so hastily and rashly quitted. The children hunted all over the house, in every place they could think of, but, as you may imagine, he was nowhere to be found. After searching for about half-an-hour, they returned to the play-room and held a consultation as to what was to be done next. They settled to divide themselves into bands of twos and threes, so as not all to go to the same places together, and after a further hunt, to meet again in the play-room and hear what success had been met with. This plan was carried out, but no one saw any sign of Herbert. It was rather good fun at first, but they got rather tired of it after a time ; and they began to feel that the afternoon was wearing away, and that they ought really to settle some 172 thing, and be learning their parts. They had already wasted a good deal of time; and what would Uncle Claud say, if, when he returned home, he found no one ready for the rehearsal ? â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Neville, â\\x80\\x98it isnâ\\x80\\x99t our fault if he goes30 HERBERT MANNERS. away. We must really settle it without him, and leave some minor part in case he cares to have it. But he certainly said he would not act at all.â\\x80\\x99 So they set to work to assign all the different parts, and, by universal assent, the Beastâ\\x80\\x99s part was given to Jem. After it was all once settled, they were all very quiet for three-quarters of an hour, learning their parts. After that, they said them to each other, and then had a sort of rehearsal. By this time it was dark, and they all began to get a little frightened about Herbert. â\\x80\\x98 I think we had better go and have another hunt,â\\x80\\x99 said Neville. The others agreed, and they set off again. They hunted upstairs, downstairs, in every hole and corner, but with no success ; and at last they settled to go and look in the drawing-room. It was the only place they had not explored. Neville, however, was rather unwilling to go in there. His conscience was not quite clear as to the way he had behaved to Herbert; and he did not particularly want to be questioned by his father, who was sitting in the drawing-room, as to his share in the matter. His father had often spoken to him about teasing and saying provoking things, and told him what a bad habit it was ; and he knew that he had done wrong to irritate Herbert, and put him in a rage by his taunts and jeers, when he saw he was getting out of temper.HERBERT MANNERS. 3t Lily, however, who was getting dreadfully fright 172 ened about Herbert, and beginning to fancy some 172 thing must have happened to him, insisted on going in. The others remained outside ; and in a few minutes she returned to them with the same old story. No one had seen anything of Herbert since they all went into the play-room together, after luncheon. â\\x80\\x98 Oh dear !â\\x80\\x99 sighed Mabel. â\\x80\\x98 I do wish we could find him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I wish you hadnâ\\x80\\x99t teased him so, Neville,â\\x80\\x99 said Lotty. â\\x80\\x98 It was all your fault.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t my fault a bit more than anybody elseâ\\x80\\x99s,â\\x80\\x99 said Neville, who was getting very uneasy, and therefore resented the accusation all the more. It was certainly becoming serious. What were they to do ! What were they to say to Uncle Claud when he arrived ? What would he say when he heard they had all been quarrelling over their parts ? And supposing something had happened to Herbert! â\\x80\\x98 Oh dear !â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Harry, 1 it is very dis 172 agreeable, and I wish none of it had ever hap 172 pened.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And so do I ;â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And so do I,â\\x80\\x99 said some of the others. â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s not a happy day, after all,â\\x80\\x99 said Lily. â\\x80\\x98 I thought it was going to be so happy, and now itâ\\x80\\x99s not a bit happy. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a most unhappy day, / think.â\\x80\\x9932 HERBERT MANNERS. â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s horrid,â\\x80\\x99 said Johnny. â\\x80\\x98 I wish it was over.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And I wish it had never been,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s no use finding fault with the day,â\\x80\\x99 said Jem. â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s not the dayâ\\x80\\x99s fault. Itâ\\x80\\x99s our own fault for quarrelling and irritating Herbert.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Dear Jem,â\\x80\\x99 said Lotty, â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you have anything to blame yourself for. You didnâ\\x80\\x99t irritate him. You are about the only one who didnâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And the only one who didnâ\\x80\\x99t insist upon having the best part,â\\x80\\x99 added Mabel. â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 groaned Neville, â\\x80\\x98 weâ\\x80\\x99ve made a nice mess of it. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve spoilt all our own enjoyment, and turned all our fun into trouble. I wish we had the day over again. You see if Iâ\\x80\\x99d bother Herbert again, or stick out for the best part. Why ! if we could only find him, Iâ\\x80\\x99d beg him to take the part ; beg and pray him. That I would ! Why, Mabel, whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter ? Youâ\\x80\\x99re crying!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Not exactly,â\\x80\\x99 said Mabel, her voice shaking all the time ; â\\x80\\x98 but I am so frightened about Herbert. I canâ\\x80\\x99t think what can have become of him, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m so afraid something may have happened to him -â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Whatâ\\x80\\x94what !â\\x80\\x99 they all cried. â\\x80\\x98 Something dreadfid, you know,â\\x80\\x99 she said, her voice sinking to the lowest whisper, â\\x80\\x98a dreadfulâ\\x80\\x94 dreadful thing !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What sort of thing ?â\\x80\\x99 they said, â\\x80\\x98 crowding round her, infected by her fear and by her look and manner. â\\x80\\x98 Upstairs, you know,â\\x80\\x99 she said anxiously, â\\x80\\x98 as weHERBERT MANNERS. 33 passed through the big, empty, spare room, which is never used because it is so big and cold, I saw â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Saw what ? Saw what ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 A greatâ\\x80\\x94bigâ\\x80\\x94blackâ\\x80\\x94box ! !â\\x80\\x99 she said, and she shivered all over as she said it. They all burst out laughing. â\\x80\\x98 I thought} you were going to say a ghost, or Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s dead body,â\\x80\\x99said Neville. â\\x80\\x98 What is there so dreadful in a great big, black box ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t the box, exactly,â\\x80\\x99 said Mabel, â\\x80\\x98 but thinking what there might be in it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What did you think there might be in it ?â\\x80\\x99 in 172 quired two or three, eagerly and a little uneasily. â\\x80\\x98Ah! that was just it,â\\x80\\x99 said Mabel, and she shivered again. â\\x80\\x98 Well, tell us !â\\x80\\x94tell us ! Out with it !â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Neville. â\\x80\\x98 Herbert !â\\x80\\x99 said Mabel, in an awe-struck whis 172 per. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, donâ\\x80\\x99t you ^remember,â\\x80\\x99 she went on, â\\x80\\x98the story of the Old Oak Chest ? Iâ\\x80\\x99m so afraid Herbert has done like that poor girlâ\\x80\\x94that heâ\\x80\\x99s got in that big box to hide from us, and that the spring has snapped down the lid upon him,and now he canâ\\x80\\x99t get out. And that some dayâ\\x80\\x94some day, when we are all grown-up men and women, we shall come upon the box, and open it, and find only his â\\x80\\x9cmouldering bones.â\\x80\\x9d Andâ\\x80\\x94and â\\x80\\x99 But here poor little Mabel, overcome by the picture she had conjured up, fairly burst into tears. 334 HERBERT MANNERS. â\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s easily put to rights,â\\x80\\x99 said Neville; â\\x80\\x98weâ\\x80\\x99ll all go at once and open the box ! Come along.â\\x80\\x99 And, quick as thought, Neville rushed off, all the others following. But when they got into the empty room, and saw the â\\x80\\x98great big black boxâ\\x80\\x99 by the dim light of the dying day, they all shrank back a little. A silence fell upon them, and they all kept close to 172 gether at the door, staring at the box from a safe distance. â\\x80\\x98It looks just like a thing to contain â\\x80\\x9cmoulder 172 ing bones,â\\x80\\x9d doesnâ\\x80\\x99t it ?â\\x80\\x99 said Harry to Neville. â\\x80\\x98Well, anyhow, they canâ\\x80\\x99t be â\\x80\\x9cmouldering bonesâ\\x80\\x9d yet,â\\x80\\x99 said Neville, boldly; â\\x80\\x98supposing Herbert is in there, he canâ\\x80\\x99t have been there more than an hour and a half.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Letâ\\x80\\x99s come nearer,â\\x80\\x99 said Jem, who, though the quietest, was the bravest of all. â\\x80\\x98 Perhaps itâ\\x80\\x99s empty. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll lift it up and see.â\\x80\\x99 Mabel seized hold of Jemâ\\x80\\x99s hand. Something about his quiet made her feel more confidence in his protection than in Nevilleâ\\x80\\x99s, in spite of all Nevilleâ\\x80\\x99s bluster and talk. One behind the other, they all advanced, and silently they stood round the box. â\\x80\\x98 Give a hand, Harry,â\\x80\\x99 said Jem,â\\x80\\x98weâ\\x80\\x99ll try and lift it.â\\x80\\x99 They did so : but it was quite heavy, and they could not move it easily. They let it down again. There was no doubt it was full of somethingâ\\x80\\x94but of what ?HERBERT MANNERS. 35 Lotty, trembling a little, now tried to lift the lid ; pulled and fumbled, fumbled and pulled. All to no purpose. The box was locked ! â\\x80\\x98Oh dear!â\\x80\\x99 cried Mabel; â\\x80\\x98 it is true then. He has got in, and the lid snapped upon him with a spring.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I say,â\\x80\\x99 said Lotty anxiously, to Jem,â\\x80\\x98do you think he could breathe in there ?â\\x80\\x99 Poor little Mabel overheard this remark, and was for a moment quite beside herself with fear. She rushed forward, and began knocking on the box with her knuckles, as if it was Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s bed 172 room door. â\\x80\\x98Herbert! Herbert!â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98itâ\\x80\\x99s only me! No one but me shall come in ; if youâ\\x80\\x99ll only say if you are alive and safe. Herbert ! dear, darling Herbert ! are you there ?â\\x80\\x99 And she put her ear down to the box and listened anxiously. There was not a sound. â\\x80\\x98Herbert dear! if you only answer, and say youâ\\x80\\x99re there, you shall be got out, and choose your part, and be the Beast, or anything you like â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I say,â\\x80\\x99 interrupted Jem hotly, â\\x80\\x98you know the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s-maid ; go and ask her for the keyâ\\x80\\x94quick. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll open the box in a moment. Here ! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll come with you.â\\x80\\x99 Away they both rushed, and in an incredibly short space of time returned with the maid and the key. â\\x80\\x98 It is quite, quite impossible,â\\x80\\x99 said the maid, â\\x80\\x98 for 3â\\x80\\x9423 6 HERBERT MANNERS. any young gentleman to be in there. The box is full of every sort of thing. It is where my mistress keeps her stock of poor-clothes, sheets, blankets, and all manner. However, weâ\\x80\\x99ll open it and see.â\\x80\\x99 She did so ; the children crowded eagerly round, turned out everything upon the floor ; but it was as she had said. There was nothing there but poor-clothes. Half relieved and half disappointed, the children turned away, and went back to the play-room, leaving the poor maid to re-arrange the things. â\\x80\\x98 Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no use saying anything more,â\\x80\\x99 said Jem ; * we must do what we ought to have done long ago. We must go at once and tell our fathers and mothers all about it. Herbert must have gone out and got lost in the snow, and the only thing to be done is to send torches and lanthorns in every direction.â\\x80\\x99 With very long faces they all marched to the drawing-room, and with Lotty at their head, who had agreed to be spokeswoman, opened the door, and walked slowly and solemnly in. CHAPTER VI. Even outside in the snow, Herbert did not feel secure. Neville and Harry would think no more of the weather than he did himself, and would very likely come out after him. So he could not stay where he was. He mustHERBERT MANNERS. 37 be off somewhere. And he set off running, he didnâ\\x80\\x99t much care in what direction. He was still sobbing and crying, and was deter 172 mined none of them should see him till every trace of tears should be gone. He could fancy how Neville would call him a â\\x80\\x98 water-potâ\\x80\\x99 and a â\\x80\\x98 cry-baby ;â\\x80\\x99 and he was deter 172 mined to stay out till he had quite got over it, even if he had to stay hours and hours in the snow. He was still very angry; and his tears, I am sorry to say, were not tears of sorrow and repent 172 anceâ\\x80\\x94which are tears of which no boy need ever be ashamedâ\\x80\\x94but of rage and mortification, dis 172 appointment and wounded pride. Fear seized him that he was being pursued. He fancied he heard voices in the distance, behind him, and he rushed wildly on. He did not know where he was, for the air was obscured by the falling snow, and the grass and road the same colour. But as long as he fancied he heard those voices, he did not much care where he went, if only he got away from them. He stopped at last from sheer want of breath, and then he listened. To his dismay he found he had not been mis 172 taken. There were voices behind him ; he could hear them now quite plainly. They were laughing voicesâ\\x80\\x94voices of boys and girls mingling merrily togetherâ\\x80\\x94and of boys and girls running as they laughed and talked. In his excitement he thought he could distinguish38 HERBERT MANNERS. Nevilleâ\\x80\\x99s voice above the rest, and he set off run 172 ning quicker than ever. But, run as he would, they seemed to gain upon him. He was obliged to stop every now and then to gain breath, and he all at once discovered that he was getting further and further from the house, and nearer and nearer to the lodge. Yes, there was the lodge, not very many yards in front of him. He could see the little light in the casement window, where probably Mrs. Harris and little Beauty were sitting over their work. At the sight a pang shot through him. Every 172 thing seemed so changed since yesterday afternoon, when he had driven through the gate in such high spirits,waving his handkerchief and looking forward with such delight to all the fun he was going to have. Or even since the night before, when he had so gladly accepted Mrs. Harrisâ\\x80\\x99 invitation to come to the lodge and see her and her little grandchild. How impossible such a thing seemed now ! Fancy presenting himself in there with his tear- stained face and swollen eyes. He ! a great boy nine years old. How surprised little Beauty would be to see her protector of last night transformed into a sobbing little runaway boy ! No, he must turn back as quick as he could, and get as far from the lodge as possible. But while these thoughts had been passing through his mind, he had slackened his pace, in fact, had stood almost still ; and he had given those behind time to gain upon him. He heard their voices plainer thanHERBERT MANNERS. 39 ever ; nay, he even fancied he could dimly discern their advancing figures through all the blinding snow. He was now, as it were, caught in a trap. There was the lodge on one side, and the ad 172 vancing children on the other. What was he to do ? There was only one course open to him. He must double back and pass the children, trusting to his own legs, and the surprise his unexpected manÅ\\x93uvre would cause them, to give him a few minutesâ\\x80\\x99 advantage, and enable him to get back to the house before them. His mind was made up. His heart beat high. Back he turned, and shouting, * Iâ\\x80\\x99ll knock down the first who touches me,â\\x80\\x99 he rushes towards the ad 172 vancing group. Blind with passion and excitement, he rushed pell-mell into their midst, striking out right and left. . One or two recoiled as he approached ; but one, as it seemed to him, stood right in his path, stretching out its hands as if to impede his flight. He seized this one by the shoulders, and with all his might flung it to the ground, and rushed on on his now unobstructed way. He ran and ran till he was out of earshot of any sound of voices, out of earshot too of the pitiful cry of the child he had thrown down, which had struck like a knell upon his hearing, despite his wild passion, and his own loud breathing and sobs. And then all at once he stopped short. What makes him suddenly stand so stock still?40 HERBERT MANNERS. What sudden thought cuts him through and through like a knife as the sound of that little cry- all at once echoes in his heart ? What has he done ? The blood rushes to his face, and his heart beats loud and fast as the thought passes into cer 172 tainty, that he has made some terrible mistake ! that those children were not the children that he had imagined them to be, and that in his blind passion and fury he has wreaked his vengeance on an innocent person, and injured some poor un 172 offending child. And if so, on whom ? Who were the children he had met ? Of course !... He saw it all now. They were some of the village children coming home from school. No ! not that. It was holiday time ; but from sliding on the pond in the park, where he had seen them in the distance that morn 172 ing. But who had he knocked down ? Ah ! that was it. Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s heart was beating faster than ever, for he had a horrible presentiment that he knew who it was ; that the little voice that had lifted up its pitiful cry was not unknown to him. It must have beenâ\\x80\\x94alas ! he was quite certain now that it was little Beauty, the dear little girl whom he had befriended, and who had clung to him so confidingly only the night before ! All Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s passion was subdued at once. He was seized with horror and the most bitter remorse when he reflected on the length to which his temper and his want of self-control had led him. WithHERBERT MANNERS. 41 deep mortification, too, that he, who prided himself so on being brave and manly, should have knocked down a little girl. He wrung his hands and ex 172 claimed : â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! what a brute I have been ! I have acted indeed the part of a Beastâ\\x80\\x94Beauty and the Beast, indeed !â\\x80\\x99 He retraced his steps after a time, to see if he could be of any use, or if the child were really much hurt ; but the whole party had disappeared. Straining his eyes through the darkness and fall 172 ing snow, he saw that he was close to the lodge again. The door was open, and he could hear the eager voices of children and the sympathetic voice of Mrs. Harrison ; but he could not hear what any 172 one said. He felt as if he ought to go in, and explain and beg the childâ\\x80\\x99s pardon for the mistake he had made. But he could not make up his mind to do so. Satis 172 fied that, at any rate, the child had reached home and was in safe hands, he made his way back to the house a saddened, sobered, conscience-stricken boy ; and slipping up the back stairs, he got to his own bed-room, and there gave himself up to the sorrow and repentance which had been so long in coming. Sadly he reflected on his motherâ\\x80\\x99s warnings and advice, and the lesson she had so often given him on self-control. How he longed to be able to go to her, and to pour out all his troubles. His aunts were strange to him, and he felt there was42 HERBERT MANNERS. no one in the house to whom he could go for advice. How long he lay on the floor thinking it all over he did not know. He was roused by the voices of the little children in the passage on their way down to the drawing-room. This meant that it was half 172 past five at least. What was he to do next ? How was he ever to face all the others ? But something must be done, and quickly too. In his despair he bethought him of going down 172 stairs with the small children, and slipping into the drawing-room with them. He jumped up and ran down the stairs, over 172 taking the little party in the hall, just outside the drawing-room door. No one would observe his entrance, or think it strange he should be there, if they did. He was known to be fond of children, and so no one would be surprised that he should come in at their hour. It was Liberty Hall ; everyone was free to do as they liked best. So, taking one of the smallest children by the hand, he opened the drawing-room door boldly, and walked in. The first thing he saw was Uncle Claud, stand 172 ing with his back to the fire, having evidently not long arrived. This sight rather took Herbert aback ; he felt a little nervous as to the questions that might be put to him, and he felt himself getting red, and trying to avoid his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s eye. To his surprise and re-HERBERT MANNERS. 43 lief, however, Uncle Claud took no notice of him ; he looked at him for a moment, certainly, very fixedly, but after that went on talking to the others. Herbert breathed a sigh of relief, and established himself rather out of sight on the floor by the fire, with a large picture-book on his lap, which he began showing to one or two of the children, who eagerly clustered round him. His heart beat rather quickly once when one of his aunts said rather suddenly : â\\x80\\x98 Herbert, are you there ? The others were in 172 quiring for you just now.â\\x80\\x99 He murmured something rather unintelligible, and was very thankful to the small girl by his side for tearing the page of the picture-book, and thereby diverting her motherâ\\x80\\x99s attention. â\\x80\\x98 There have been several cases of assault in the neighbourhood lately,â\\x80\\x99 said Uncle Claud, suddenly. â\\x80\\x98 I suppose a good many rough men connected with the new railway line take advantage of the snow and the darkness,â\\x80\\x99 said one of the ladies. â\\x80\\x98 What do the naughty men do ?â\\x80\\x99 asked one of the children ; â\\x80\\x98 And what is a â\\x80\\x99salt ?â\\x80\\x99 asked another at the same moment ; â\\x80\\x98 And do they steal the salt ?â\\x80\\x99 chimed in a third. 1 Assault/ answered Uncle Claud, answering all three questions at once, â\\x80\\x98 means to hurt people, or knock them down.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But what for ?â\\x80\\x99 persisted one child. â\\x80\\x98 For various reasons,â\\x80\\x99 answered Uncle Claud ;44 HERBERT MANNERS. â\\x80\\x98 sometimes it is with a view to robbing the per 172 son after knocking him down. Sometimes it is from revenge, or from some wicked feeling of anger or temper.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What is done to the naughty unkind person ?â\\x80\\x99 asked a very small girl, who was well known to be Uncle Claudâ\\x80\\x99s favourite. â\\x80\\x98 The great tall policeman comes in,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, â\\x80\\x98 marches up to him, lays his hand on his shoulder, and says â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What does he say ?â\\x80\\x99 said the child, rather scared. 1 He says, in a great big voice, â\\x80\\x9c I apprehend you on a charge of assault !â\\x80\\x9d and then he takes him off to prison by the collar. And serve him right.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m rather frightened,â\\x80\\x99 said the child. â\\x80\\x98You neednâ\\x80\\x99t be, darling,â\\x80\\x99he said very gently, stroking the childâ\\x80\\x99s hair ; â\\x80\\x98 he only comes to naughty, unkind people, not to good little gentle things like you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No,â\\x80\\x99 said the little girl, with a long breath of re 172 lief; â\\x80\\x98 and weâ\\x80\\x99re all good, kind, gentle people here, ainâ\\x80\\x99t we ? so he wonâ\\x80\\x99t come to this house, particu 172 larly at Christmastime.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 We ought 4 all to be,â\\x80\\x99 answered Uncle Claud, gravely ; â\\x80\\x98 but Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid thereâ\\x80\\x99s always a black sheep in every flock.â\\x80\\x99 And as he spoke, Herbert felt as if his uncle shot a glance at him. He felt mystified and un 172 comfortable ; he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t make it all out. But there came a sudden interruption. TheHERBERT MANNERS. 45 door slowly opened, and Herbert, dreading who might be going to enter, shrank away still further behind his aunt with his little companions. And thus, my readersâ\\x80\\x94who know better than Herbert what the interruption wasâ\\x80\\x94thus it came to pass that when Neville, and Harry, and Johnnie, and Jem, and Lotty, and Lily, and Mabel came in open-mouthed with their tale of horror and despair, the first person they saw was Herbert, sitting quietly in a corner of the hearth-rug, reading â\\x80\\x98Jack the Giant-killer â\\x80\\x99 to the little ones ! * * * * * * But whatever were their feelings, they had to keep them to themselves, for the moment Uncle Claudâ\\x80\\x99s eye fell upon them he sent them all off to the play-room, saying they were to put on their dresses at once, and that the full-dress rehearsal would take place as soon as they were ready. There was no time to be lost, and off they all had to go, Herbert unwillingly following. He felt it would be less remarkable to do so than to remain behind, and he was so humbled that he felt he would accept any part they chose to give him. He was ready to be even a servant with nothing to say. But what was his surprise when he reached the play-room to find them all crowding round him, and begging his pardon for all that had passed between them. He could hardly believe his ears. There was Neville shaking hands with him, and asking him to forget and forgive all the disagreeable46 HERBERT MANNERS. things he had said; Harry, also, and the girls kissed him, and said they were so happy to see him again, and so glad to think he was safe and well and among them all again, and with one voice asking where in the world he had hidden himself, and telling him how dreadfully frightened they had all been about him. It dawned upon him suddenly that they must have thought he was lost in the snow, and he told them he had been out. â\\x80\\x98 But,â\\x80\\x99 he added, â\\x80\\x98 please do not ask me anything more. I have been very unhappy, but I am happier now that you are all so kind to me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And now you must promise to act the Beastâ\\x80\\x99s part,â\\x80\\x99 said Jem. â\\x80\\x98 Yes, yes !â\\x80\\x99 cried all the rest. â\\x80\\x98 Oh no,â\\x80\\x99 said Herbert ; â\\x80\\x98 I would rather not, really. I donâ\\x80\\x99t feel as if I should do it well now.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You must ! you must !â\\x80\\x99 cried all ; â\\x80\\x98just to show you have forgiven us. Quick ! run and get your skin ; and we must all hurry scurry, for Uncle Claud will be here in a minute.â\\x80\\x99 So saying, they all ran off to dress, and Herbert, with a heavy heart, prepared to do the very thing he had so ardently longed to do. But it was no pleasure to him now. He would far rather not act at all. He felt he had not spirit enough in him to do the part well. And so it proved. For when the time came for him to go on, such a poor, faint roaring Beast sounded from behind the scenes that Uncle ClaudHERBERT MANNERS. 47 got quite impatient, and called out to him to do the part properly or else leave it alone. Herbert roused himself after that, and got on better, though several times his thoughts wandered to little Beauty, and her pitiful cry in the snow, and each time provoked his uncle to call out, â\\x80\\x98 Speak up, man ! No one can hear a word you say.â\\x80\\x99 As the play proceeded, Herbert threw himself more into his part, tried to put little Beauty out of his head, and succeeded in acquitting himself at last more to his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s satisfaction. CHAPTER VII. Two hours later the house was lighted from end to end, and all was bustle and excitement. Guests began to arrive ; carriages drove up every moment. All the children, excepting the actors, were as 172 sembled in the hall dressed and ready for the even 172 ingâ\\x80\\x99s entertainment, and it was here, also, that the guests were received. At nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock there was a general move to the acting-room, which was dark, and everyone was marshalled to their seats. Socn everybody was seated. The curtain which concealed the stage, was of course down ; but from behind it came every now and then the sound of voices and laughter, quickly repressed by the admonitory voice of the stage-48 HERBERT MANNERS. manager. A head once or twice peered from behind the corner of the curtain, and was hastily withdrawn at the sound of the same warning voice. The actors were evidently getting impatient to begin their per 172 formance. Presently the sound of music was heard from behind the curtain, and a chorus of young voices sang â\\x80\\x98 Rule Britannia.â\\x80\\x99 After the applause which greeted the singing had died away, there was silence again, and the ex 172 pectation among the audience was raised to the highest pitch, especially among the children, who had the front seats. All of a sudden a long, low whistle was heard, and the curtain drew up, dis 172 covering Lily and Mabel as the two sisters. I need not enter into the story of the play. â\\x80\\x98 Beauty and the Beast â\\x80\\x99 is probably well known to all my readers. Suffice it to say that each child acted his or her part, his or her very best. To judge by the roaring of the Beast before he came on the stage, Herbert must have quite recovered his spirits. He acted capitally, and did his part to perfection. Long and loud was the applause which greeted his first exit ; and when the time came for him to throw off his disguise, no one could have imagined that the bright, happy looking boy prince, who emerged from beneath the skin, was the same boy who had sobbed and cried in the snow only a few hours before. The excitement of the evening had driven all sad thoughts away ; and as Herbert stood aloneHERBERT MANNERS. 49 in front of the foot-lights, where each was in turn called, at the end of the play, to receive the applause of the audience, he not only looked, but felt, supremely happy. He was quite a little hero when he came from behind the scenes, still wearing his princeâ\\x80\\x99s dress, and took his seat among the other children. Each of the little ones wanted him to sit next them, and all were eager to examine his sword, and the jewels in his cap. The childrenâ\\x80\\x99s part in the eveningâ\\x80\\x99s entertainment was now over, and all the little actors took their seats among the audience, to see the â\\x80\\x98 Tableaux Vivantsâ\\x80\\x99 which were now to follow. First came â\\x80\\x98The Pitcher at the Well,â\\x80\\x99 one of the childrenâ\\x80\\x99s aunts, standing, with a great vase on her head, and her hand and arm upheld, supporting it ; while one of their uncles, sitting on the edge of the imaginary well, seemed to be asking her to give him a drink. This tableau was much admired and duly applauded by the children, who could not imagine how Annt Mary could stand so still. Then came â\\x80\\x98 The Parting of Charles I. and his Children.â\\x80\\x99 In this, two of the younger children had a part. Next â\\x80\\x98The Murder of the Princes in the Tower;â\\x80\\x99 this met with rounds of applause. Then 45o HERBERT MANNERS. â\\x80\\x98Milton and his Daughters,â\\x80\\x99 in which the blind poet was represented as dictat 172 ing to one daughter, who was writing down the words as they fell from his lips, while the other was listening with rapt attention, looking all the while wonderingly and admiringly at her father. That was the last tableau ; but the audience were told to keep their seats, as there was something more to come ; though what it was, they were not told, and nobody seemed to know. Herbert had been watching all the tableaux with the deepest interest. He was enjoying himself thoroughly. He had been pleased and gratified by all the praises which had been heaped upon him, and the other boys had been so kind, and had made such a hero of him, that all sad recollections which had at one time overpowered him, had been com 172 pletely driven out of his head. His uncleâ\\x80\\x99s words and manner had passed from his mind, and he was entirely given up to the enjoyment of the moment. And now slow music rises from behind the scenes, and Uncle Claudâ\\x80\\x99s voice is heard. â\\x80\\x98 Ladies and gentlemen, we are now going to give you a new version of â\\x80\\x9c Beauty and the Beast â\\x80\\x9d in a kind of moving tableau, a panorama, as it were.â\\x80\\x99 The words struck upon Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s ear with a vague sense of impending evil. He looked up quickly and anxiously, and, as the curtain drew slowly up, a feeling that something disagreeable was going to happen came over him, and his heart began to beat quickly. The scene was a snow-HERBERT MANNERS. 51 storm. Small white flakes were falling in every direction, to the intense delight of all the little children. Little inquiring voices were heard breaking out in different parts of the darkened roomâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 How do they do it ?â\\x80\\x99 * How can they manage it ?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94and the explanatory voices of elders, saying something about â\\x80\\x98bits of paperâ\\x80\\x99 and a â\\x80\\x98waste paper basket but all was drowned by the indignant â\\x80\\x98 Hush !â\\x80\\x99 which came simultaneously from the elder child 172 ren. Every eye was strained upon the stage, to see what was coming, and Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s gaze was pain 172 fully intent. For, standing upon the stage, in the middle of the snow-storm, was a little figure which he knew well : a little figure, with a red cloak, and a blue worsted hood upon its head. Nor was he the only one who recognised it. There was a cry from all the children, â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s Beauty! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s< little Beauty,â\\x80\\x99 and a small compassionate voice added, â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! po\\'r little Beautyâ\\x80\\x94out in all the snow !â\\x80\\x99 The curtain fell, and the little figure in the snow 172 storm disappeared from view. Herbert, gazing, as if by doing so he should sec through the mystery with his own eyes and solve it, was standing bolt upright. He had risen to his feet unconsciously in his wonder and excitement. His heart was beating quicker than ever, and his face was paler than it had been a few minutes before. â\\x80\\x98 And now,â\\x80\\x99 said the sonorous voice of Uncle Claud, from behind the scenes, â\\x80\\x98 we are going to show you The Beast.â\\x80\\x99 4â\\x80\\x94252 HERBERT MANNERS. The curtain drew slowly up, and discovered the snowstorm again. But there was a change in the centre figure. There, instead of little Beauty, stood a figure in a brown ulster and a black wideawake ; at the sight of which Herbert turned ashy white, and grasped or tried to grasp the back of the chair immediately in front of him. He could hardly breathe for thinking what might be coming next. The children clapped their hands. â\\x80\\x98 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s Her 172 bert !â\\x80\\x99 they all shouted. â\\x80\\x98 He was â\\x80\\x9cthe Beast,â\\x80\\x9d you know, just now,â\\x80\\x99 they explained to the little ones. Their voices sounded a long way off to Herbert. The room was beginning to go round and round, and he hardly knew if he was standing on his head or not. There was a curious singing noise in his ears, and his knees trembled under him and knocked together. But the curtain descended, and the scene dis 172 appeared. â\\x80\\x98 Now,â\\x80\\x99 said Uncle Claud again, â\\x80\\x98we are going to show you Beauty and The Beast. You shall see them together.â\\x80\\x99 Herbert getting more and more giddy every mo 172 ment, but with his gaze still fixed upon the stage, saw the curtain rise, and the two figures standing together. And as he looked he saw, to his horror, his own figure begin to move. He saw it begin toHERBERT MANNERS. 53 stride across the stage, with frowning face and furious gestures. He saw it advance towards little Beauty, with uplifted arm and in menacing attitude ; and a sound broke from him half of horror and half of despair. A cry, too, burst from all the children, as the boy on the stage seized little Beauty by the shoulders and flung her roughly to the ground. â\\x80\\x98 It was a mistake,â\\x80\\x99 shrieked Herbert, â\\x80\\x98 a misâ\\x80\\x94tâ\\x80\\x94 aâ\\x80\\x94k â\\x80\\x99 But his voice died away, and was lost in a sudden loud thundering knocking, which came upon the play-room door. Every head was in 172 stantly turned that way. The door flew open, and the bright light in the hall played upon the figure of a tall policeman, who, advancing to the master of the house, said in a loud voice : â\\x80\\x98 I beg your pardon, sir ; but have you among your guests a young gentleman of the name of Manners ? I apprehend him on a charge of assault.â\\x80\\x99 But Herbert heard no more. As the policeman spoke the giddiness in his head became overpower 172 ing. He tried to speak, but no sound came. Lights, stage, children, danced before him, and then faded away, and he fell, fainting, into the arms of the policeman, which were just held out in time to catch him, and to prevent his falling headlong on the floor.54 HERBERT MANNERS. CONCLUDING CHAPTER. In order to explain what seemed so mysterious and inexplicable to poor Herbert, we must return to the afternoon preceding the play, and follow the movements of Uncle Claud on his return from his expedition to London. It so happened, that just as the carriage which had met him stopped at the lodge gate, on its way home, the procession of school children, escort 172 ing the poor little bruised and sobbing Beauty, was going in at the door, Uncle Claud, seeing some 172 thing was the matter, instantly got out of the brougham, and followed them. By this means he arrived in the cottage just in time to hear the story poured forth to Mrs. Harrison by the indignant little boys who had witnessed the unprovoked attackâ\\x80\\x94which story was confirmed by poor little Beautyâ\\x80\\x99s appearance, covered with snow, and her forehead bruised and bleeding, from having in her fall come in contact with a sharp piece of frozen wood. Uncle Claud, as you may imagine, was as indig 172 nant in his own mind as the boys, and indeed could hardly believe his own ears. However, the wounds were not really serious, and the child more frightened than hurt ; so after ex 172 pressing his sympathy, and asking a good many questions, Uncle Claud took leave of them all, and got back into the carriage. But as he wentHERBERT MANNERS. 55 along, he determined he would give Herbert a lesson he should never forget. â\\x80\\x98 Coward !â\\x80\\x99 he said to himself once or twice. The very idea of a boy, from whatever cause, knocking down a little girl, would have made Uncle Claudâ\\x80\\x99s indignation boil over. But in this case there seemed no provocation, no motive. Simply, as far as he could make out from the other children, it was because she stood in his way. It appeared to Uncle Claud a piece of imperious tyranny of which he could not think with any patience. Still, Uncle Claud was very just; and he was not sure it would be right to condemn Herbert unheard. It might have been an accident. He was inclined, strong as the proofs were against him, to give him a chance of explaining himself. He expected, on his return home, to find that everybody knew the story, and would be ready to give him their divers opinions as to Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s share of blame in the matter. But to his surprise, the subject was not mentioned, though he stood talking to the assembled party in the drawing-room for fully ten minutes after his arrival. He began to think the village boys must have made a mistake, and that it had not been Herbert at all. By-and-by, as my readers will remember, the door opened to admit the younger children, and with themâ\\x80\\x94Herbert. One glance at him convinced Uncle Claud of his guilt. The boy slipped in as if he did not wish to be observed, and instead of running up eagerly to his uncle as usual, he appeared56 HERBERT MANNERS. anxious to avoid his eye, and disappeared some 172 where behind one of his aunts, with one of the smallest of the children. Now, if Uncle Claud hated one thing more than another, it was anything like a want of opennessâ\\x80\\x94â\\x96\\xa0 anything approaching to deceit. It became evident to him at once, not only that Herbert was guilty, but that he was trying to conceal his guilt. He was evidently trusting to the tale of his misbehaviour not reaching the house, at any rate for that evening. Uncle Claudâ\\x80\\x99s face assumed a very stern expression, and he instantly resolved to expose him in some way before the whole company. What that way should be, he could not at once determine. But he thought he would give him one or two opportunities of confessing his fault first. So he led the conversation up to the subject of assaults, as you will remember, hoping that Herbert, con 172 victed by his own conscience, might speak. But that failed. During the rehearsing he gave him several other opportunities of telling his story and righting himself. But he took advantage of none ; and so then Uncle Claud made up his mind to punish him. He sent down to the lodge to borrow Beautyâ\\x80\\x99s cloak and hood, and easily possessed him 172 self of Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s wideawake and ulster, retaining behind the scene two of the children of the proper sizes to act the parts. With what success we have seen. But what about the policeman ? The police 172 man was Uncle Claud. He had by him a police 172 manâ\\x80\\x99s dress in which he had acted on former occa-HERBERT MANNERS. 57 sions, and had intended to appear in it as a surprise to the children at some time or other during the evening. It struck him that his sudden appearance would form a fitting conclusion to the panorama, and would show Herbert who it was that had brought him thus publicly to shame, as a punishment for his conduct and its concealment. But he had never expected to produce such an effect upon the boy. Indeed he had not expected that Herbert should have so completely failed to recognise him. Nothing would have been further from his wishes than to give him such a terrible fright, had he known the overwrought state into which the boy had worked himself, and the moment he perceived Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s condition, his whole feeling towards him changed. Displeasure turned into anxiety, and nothing could have been more tender than the way in which the supposed policeman took up the fainting boy in his arms and carried him out of the crowd into his own bedroom the other side of the hall, where he laid him down on the bed. First hastily throwing off some part of his own disguise, he loosened Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s collar, and dashed cold water into his face. With the aid of one of his sisters-in-law, who had followed him, he set to work with all the restoratives they could think of, to re 172 store the boy to consciousness. They were soon successful. It was not very long before Herbert opened his eyes, and fixed them,58 HERBERT MANNERS. with a puzzled look, on the person who, half police 172 man, half Uncle Claud, was kneeling by his side. He had turned giddy and faint, but he had not really quite fainted ; so it did not take him long to put two-and-two together, and to take in all that had happened. â\\x80\\x98 Was it you, Uncle Claud ?â\\x80\\x99 he said wonderingly. Uncle Claud smiled and nodded, but would allow no conversation at first. However, Herbert begged so hard to be allowed to tell his story, and said he should feel so much better and happier if he had it all out, that Uncle Claud at length consented. He listened most attentively as Herbert described the events of the day from the beginning to the end, and as the tale went on, his face lost gradually much of its gravity. To Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s immense relief, he told him when it was finished that he had not been nearly so much to blame as he had supposed, and that had he known the details, he never should have given him so severe a lesson. He added a few kind, though stern words, on the necessity of self-control, and also pointed out how much better it would have been if Herbert had at once told some one the story directly he had re 172 turned home. â\\x80\\x98 And now,â\\x80\\x99 he said, rising, â\\x80\\x98 I shall go and right you before the crowd in the other room, and you shall hear all about it to-morrow.â\\x80\\x99 Left under the care of his aunt, Herbert was very glad to take her advice and try and go to sleep,HERBERT MANNERS. 59 for he was quite exhausted with ail he had been through. As soon as she saw he was sleeping soundly, she had him carried upstairs to his own room, and he never woke till the next morning. Meanwhile Uncle Claud made his way back to the play-room, and, after a few words of conversa 172 tion with Jem, whom he called on one side, he mounted the stage, and, advancing to the footlights, called out that he had a few words to say to the audience before they dispersed. He then explained the whole affair, exonerating Herbert entirely from having intentionally done the mean action of which he had been suspected ; adding a few words of pointed rebuke to those who, by a foolish habit of teasing, had goaded him into losing his temper. â\\x80\\x98Not,â\\x80\\x99 he added, in conclusion, â\\x80\\x98 not that I in the least wish to excuse him, or to palliate his fault. There is no excuse for passion and violence. But I do say that the blame of the disastrous conse 172 quences of Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s want of self-control lies in a great measure at the door of those who, knowing his disposition, and seeing the condition he was in, did their utmost to drive him to extremities. I ask no questions ; I mention no names. Let those whose consciences tell them the cap fits, put it on ; and may they take to themselves a lesson for the coming year.â\\x80\\x99 There were one or two faces suffused with crimson as Uncle Claud brought his short speech to a close;6o HERBERT MANNERS. and I am happy to say, that as he descended from the platform, the owners of those crimsoning faces ran straight up to him, like honest English boys, and owned their share in the matter and their deep regret for the same. Uncle Claud shook hands with them heartily ; and then, in answer to a question which was going from lip to lip among the audience, he once more advanced to the footlights, and said he was most happy to be able to tell them Herbert was recover 172 ing rapidly, though he would not be able to re 172 appear among them that evening. â\\x80\\x98 But as to that,â\\x80\\x99 concluded Uncle Claud, â\\x80\\x98 the evening is over. The play is ended and the lights going out. LÃ\\xa0dies and gentlemen, I wish you all a happy new year.â\\x80\\x99THE TOWN-CRIER; OR, LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS.CHAPTER I. This is a story of which half is about a rich little girl, whose name was Edith Leigh, and the other half about a poor little girl, whose name was Nancy Brown. To begin with Edith Leigh. She was an only child, and she lived with her father and mother in a beautiful old place in Kent, which she was very fond of, and where she was very happy. She had all sorts of pets and amusements in her beautiful home. To begin with, there was her lamb, and her white rabbits, and her silver pheasant, and her little chickens. Then there were the gold and silver fish in the little pond by her little garden ; and close by was her own little tool-house and her little arbour, and even a tiny frame where she kept her most precious plants in the winter. You see she was an only child and had no com 172 panions, so her kind mamma and papa did their best to give her plenty of interests and employ 172 ments, so that she should not be dull all alone. Perhaps of all her live pets, the one Edith loved the best was her little canary. He was so tame6 4 THE TO WN- CRIER j OR, and so affectionate. He would kiss her through the bars of his cage, and perch on her finger, and eat out of her hand. Then he had a thrilling note like a nightingale, and Edith thought there was nothing so beautiful as his song. There was one drawback to Homeleigh, as Edithâ\\x80\\x99s home was called. (A â\\x80\\x98drawbackâ\\x80\\x99 means something that prevented it being quite so perfect as it might have been.) And the drawback to Homeleigh was, that owing to the quantities of beautiful trees that grew near the house the place got very damp and un 172 wholesome towards the end of October, when the leaves were falling. Edith had once caught such a very bad cold, and been so very ill at that time, that her papa and mamma had made up their minds never to stay at Homeleigh during the fall of the leaf again, but always to go to some nice sea-side place till the leaves were quite off, and the winter fairly begun. And so it happened, at the time my story begins, that October having come, Edith and her papa and mamma were preparing to leave their beautiful home in Kent, and to go to Folkestone for six weeks. Now Edith liked a change as much as most children, and was delighted at the thoughts of bathing in the sea and digging on the beach, and having donkey-rides. But there was one part of it which she did not like, and that was saying good-bye to her garden,A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 65 and her rabbits, and her gold and silver fish, and her kitten, and her lamb, and all her other pets and possessions. Her kind mamma, however, said that she thought they could manage to take her canary with them, and so, as he was the one Edith loved best of all, she more easily made up her mind to leaving the rest behind. It was not a long journey; for Folkestone is a sea-side place in Kent, and if you look it out in the map, you will see it is the place where the steamer starts from to take you to Boulogne ; so if any of you have ever been abroad, you must have passed through Folkestone, unless by chance you went from Dover to Calais. Mr. and Mrs. Leigh and Edith arrived at about three oâ\\x80\\x99clock at their house in Bouverie Square, which Mr. Leigh had taken for six weeks. There was a charming nursery for Edith, and a bow-window where there was a capital nail to hang Dicky on, and he was hung up there directly, and given fresh sand, and seed, and water, which he had had to do without during the journey. He was very soon hopping about and pouring out his beautiful nightingale trill, quite as happy as if he had been in his accustomed place at Home- leigh. Edith was very happy too, for everything was new to her, and the sun was so bright and the sea so sparkling, and such crowds of happy little boys and girls about in goat-chaises or on donkeys, or 566 THE TOWN-CRIER; OR, else running about with spades in their hands, and colour in their cheeks. Edith was at the drawing-room window all the rest of the afternoon watching it all, and she went to bed early, that to-morrow might come quick, when she should be able to go out and dig, and ride on a donkey, too. Soon after breakfast next morning, Edith and her mamma went on the beach, and there Edith dug and played to her heartâ\\x80\\x99s content. The next thing was to go and buy some groundsel for Dicky, for he was accustomed to have some almost every day out of Edithâ\\x80\\x99s little garden. Mrs. Leigh soon spied a greengrocerâ\\x80\\x99s shop, and went in, while Edith remained at the shop-door looking out into the street. As she stood there, there came by a poor woman with a barrow of fruit and vegetables, and by her side was a little girl just the same age and size as Edith, only she was pale and thin, and looked as if she had not had a good dinner for a very long time. Now this was Nancy Brown, the poor little girl, who I told you half my story was going to be about. But though you know it, Edith did not, and little thought she should ever come to know that poor and hungry child. Still they looked at each other, as little girls will, and, in fact, Edith stared at her so, that Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s mother thought she wanted to buy, and stopped, saying :A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 67 1 Any pears or nuts to-day ; chickweed and groundsel for singing birds, or turf for larks ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, groundsel !â\\x80\\x99 said Edith ; 1 yes, stop a minute, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll ask mamma.â\\x80\\x99 She ran into the shop. â\\x80\\x98 Mamma, hereâ\\x80\\x99s a poor woman with groundsel.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Thank you, dear, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve bought Dicky enough to last him a week, or more,â\\x80\\x99 said her mamma, and went on giving orders to the shopman about sending fruit and vegetables to the house. Edith saw she was busy and did not want to be interrupted ; so, like a sensible girl, she did not go 011 bothering, like some children would, but went back to the shop-door, and said : â\\x80\\x98 Mamma says she has bought as much as she wants.â\\x80\\x99 The poor woman looked disappointed. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry to hear it, miss, for Nancy and me weâ\\x80\\x99ve sold nothing all day but a vegetable marrow, and only got twopence for that.â\\x80\\x99 Little Nancy looked at Edith with her sad dark eyes, and Edith felt very sorry too. â\\x80\\x98 Are you very poor ?â\\x80\\x99 she said, stepping out on the pavement. Nancy was beginning to answer, when Edith heard her mamma calling, and ran back again into the shop. â\\x80\\x98 Mamma, hereâ\\x80\\x99s such a poor little girl. Please, some money, quick ! Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve only got twopence,â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Weâ\\x80\\x99ll see, dear, in a minute,â\\x80\\x99 said her mamma. â\\x80\\x98Take this packet of groundsel. I want you to carry it home for me.â\\x80\\x99 5â\\x80\\x94263 THE TOU TV- CRIER ; OR, Edith took the parcel and waited while her mamma paid the money. â\\x80\\x98Now weâ\\x80\\x99ll see,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh. Edith took her mammaâ\\x80\\x99s hand, and led her eagerly to the door. â\\x80\\x98 Sheâ\\x80\\x99s so poor, and such sorrowful eyes, mamma, and only as big as me.â\\x80\\x99 But when they got into the street the little girl and the poor woman and the barrow of vegetables were all gone ! Mrs. Leigh and Edith looked up the street and down the street, and all round about, but it was to no purpose. Nowhere was the barrow to be seen. CHAPTER II. Edith was very much disappointed at first. She had taken quite a fancy to the little girl with the sad eyes. Her mamma, however, assured her she need not give up the hope of meeting the barrow again, as Folkestone was then a small town with few streets in it. If they did not happen to see the little girl this morning, they were pretty certain to see her this afternoon, and if by chance they missed her this afternoon, they were almost sure to meet her to 172 morrow. So Edith was comforted, and she and her mamma walked on. Presently they came to a small crowd of boysA LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 69 standing round a man with a big bell in his hand. He was a very fat man, dressed like a postman, only smarter. He had on a cocked-hat with gold lace, and a long collar trimmed the same as the hat. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, mamma !â\\x80\\x99 said Edith, 1 who is that man ?â\\x80\\x99 Her mamma answered that he was just going to speak, and that Edith had better listen to what he was going to say, and that she would explain to her afterwards who he was. So Mrs. Leigh and Edith joined the crowd and waited. Presently the man rang his bell, once, twice, three times, and then in a deep gruff voice he said : â\\x80\\x98 Lost ! Lost ! ! Lost ! ! !â\\x80\\x99 All the little boys laughed, and Edith laughed a little, but she was very much puzzled. Before, however, she had time to speak to her mamma, he rang his bell again, and three times repeated : 1 Lost ! Lost ! ! Lost ! ! !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What is lost, mamma ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Hush \\' youâ\\x80\\x99ll hear if you listen.â\\x80\\x99 So Edith listened again. This time the man only rang once, and then said :70 THE TO WN-CRIER; OR, â\\x80\\x98 Lost ! On the Beach A Geneva WATCH ! !â\\x80\\x99 He said the word watch so loud that Edith quite jumped, and so did some of the rest of the children standing round. Then they all laughed because they had jumped. And then they were al\\'l as still as little mice because they saw the man was going to speak again. â\\x80\\x98 Lost ! On the Beach !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I wonâ\\x80\\x99t jump this time,â\\x80\\x99 said a little boy near Edith, â\\x80\\x98 because I knoiv heâ\\x80\\x99s going to say â\\x80\\x9cwatch !\" with a great bounce.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Noâ\\x80\\x94no more will I,â\\x80\\x99 said another boy. â\\x80\\x98 No, and I wonâ\\x80\\x99t either,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith to her mamma. â\\x80\\x98 Lost ! On the Beach ! A Geneva Watch ! ! And CHAIN ! ! !â\\x80\\x99 Oh dear ! how Edith jumped, and how the boy jumped who said he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t jump, and how the other boy jumped who said hewouldnâ\\x80\\x99t jump either; and how they all laughed after they had jumped, at having been made to jump after all ! â\\x80\\x98 I never expected the great bounce of a â\\x80\\x9cchain!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x99 said the first boy. â\\x80\\x98 No more did I,â\\x80\\x99 said the other. â\\x80\\x98No, and no more did I, either, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith.A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. Then the man went on to say, that whoever found the watch, and would bring it to a certain house in a certain street, would have one pound reward. After that, he walked on to another street, to begin again, and Edith and her mamma returned home. As they went, her mamma explained to her that the man was a â\\x80\\x98 town-crier,â\\x80\\x99 and that people who had lost their watches, or other things, went and told him, so that he might call it out all over the town. By these means, those people who might happen to have found the lost articles, knew where to take them to, and got rewarded for their trouble. Edith quite understood, and thought it was a very good plan indeed. CHAPTER III. WHEN Edith and her mamma got home, they found it was nearly dinner-time. â\\x80\\x98 Run upstairs and give Dicky his groundsel,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh; â\\x80\\x98and then get ready for dinner, and come down again.â\\x80\\x99 Edith trotted off, and her mamma sat down to write a letter. But she had not got very far before she was in 172 terrupted by the door opening, and Edith rushing in, crying as if her heart would break.72 THE TO WN- CRIER; OR, â\\x80\\x98 Why ! my dear little girl, what is the matter ?â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Leigh turned round as she spoke, and saw, to her surprise, that instead of being ready for luncheon, Edith was still in her walking things. Fearing she had hurt herself on her way upstairs, Mrs. Leigh took her on her lap, and tried to make out what had happened. â\\x80\\x98 Did you tumble downstairs, darling ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! no, no.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Couldnâ\\x80\\x99t you find nurse ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! yes, yes.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Were you frightened at anything ?â\\x80\\x99 Edith shook her head, and went on crying more than ever. â\\x80\\x98 Try and tell me, dear, what it is. Donâ\\x80\\x99t cry so.â\\x80\\x99 Edith tried, but her mamma could only make out that somebody or something was â\\x80\\x98 gone.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Who is gone, dear ?â\\x80\\x99 Edith burst out again, and sobbed â\\x80\\x98 Dicky !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Dicky ? Do you mean your little canary has gone ?â\\x80\\x99 Edith nodded her head, and went on to say that when she got upstairs with the groundsel, nurse had met her at the door of the nursery and told her she was sorry to say someone had by mistake left the cage-door open, and that she was very much afraid Dicky had flown out of the window. â\\x80\\x98 She showed me the cage quite, quite, quite empty,â\\x80\\x99 sobbed Edith ; â\\x80\\x98 no dickybird, no nothing. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it sad, mamma ?â\\x80\\x99 And poor Edith cried again.A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. The nurse now appeared at the door with the empty birdcage, and repeated what Edith had said. â\\x80\\x98 But, Miss Edith, dear,â\\x80\\x99 said nurse, â\\x80\\x98 I think if we put the cage in the window, with the door open, it is very likely Dicky will come back again, and particularly if you put your groundsel in to tempt him. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you think that would be a good plan maâ\\x80\\x99am ?â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Leigh said she thought it would be a very good plan, and she advised Edith to go upstairs with nurse and help to do it. â\\x80\\x98Then/ she said, â\\x80\\x98if by the time you have finished your dinner with me Dicky has not come back, I have thought of another way of finding him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! what ?â\\x80\\x99 said Edith. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you after dinner,â\\x80\\x99 said her mamma ; â\\x80\\x98 run up now, and get washed and dressed, for it is rather late.â\\x80\\x99 So Edith and her nurse went upstairs, and Mrs. Leigh went on with her letter. Ten minutes after, the gong sounded, and Edith came down in her pinafore, ready for her dinner. â\\x80\\x98 Well !â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh, â\\x80\\x98 did you put the cage in the window ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith, â\\x80\\x98 but Dickyâ\\x80\\x99s not come back. The cage is quite empty still. Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid Dicky will never come home again, mamma.â\\x80\\x99 And Edith looked so sad that her mamma took her quickly in to dinner, and gave her some mince and mashed potato.74 THE TOIVN- CRTER ; OR, Now Edith was very hungry, so she ate away, and began to talk. CHAPTER IV. â\\x80\\x98 Mamma, will you tell me now, that what you said ?â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Leigh was puzzled for a minute, and then remembered. â\\x80\\x98 You mean my other plan for finding Dicky, if he did not come back. Canâ\\x80\\x99t you guess what it is?â\\x80\\x99 No, Edith couldnâ\\x80\\x99t. She tried, and tried, but could not think what it could be. I wonder if any of the little boys and girls who are reading this story will be able to guess ? â\\x80\\x98 Donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember, Edith, something we saw in our walk this morning ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98The poor little girl, mamma, with the sad eyes?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, I donâ\\x80\\x99t mean her. Try again.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The fruit-shop, perhaps ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No ; try again.â\\x80\\x99 Edith tried to think, but could not make out what her mamma meant. Suddenly she jumped off her chair, and clapped her hands. â\\x80\\x98You mean the funny man, mamma, the man who calls out : â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Lost ! Lost ! ! Lost ! ! !â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x99A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 75 â\\x80\\x98 Ah ! you have guessed right,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh. â\\x80\\x98 Yes, I mean him ; we will go and tell him to call out all over the town, that our poor little Dicky is â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Lost ! Lost ! ! Lost ! ! !â\\x80\\x9d Then if anyone has found him, he will be brought here directly. Do you understand ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh yes !â\\x80\\x99 Edith quite understood, and wanted to be off at once. â\\x80\\x98 What will he cry out, mamma ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well,â\\x80\\x99said Mrs. Leigh,â\\x80\\x98first of all he will cry out â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Lost ! Lost ! ! Lost ! ! !â\\x80\\x9d Then what, Edith ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I know,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c Lost ! Lost ! ! Lost ! ! !â\\x80\\x9d our poor little Dicky !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well! we shall see,â\\x80\\x99said her mamma. â\\x80\\x98Weâ\\x80\\x99ll go and tell him what has happened, and then leave it to him to cry out what he likes.â\\x80\\x99 So Edith and her mamma went out again to the street where they had seen the town-crier in the morning, but he was not there. They hunted first in one place, and then in another, but they could not find him. All of a sudden they heard a bell.76 THE TO WN-CRIERj OR, Tingâ\\x80\\x94aâ\\x80\\x94ring ! Tingâ\\x80\\x94aâ\\x80\\x94ring ! Tingâ\\x80\\x94aâ\\x80\\x94ring ! â\\x80\\x98Oh! there he is!â\\x80\\x99 said Edith; â\\x80\\x98look there, mamma, at the end of the street.â\\x80\\x99 Sure enough, there he was, with his bell in his hand, and a crowd of boys round him. Even at that distance Edith could hear quite plainly : â\\x80\\x98 Lost ! On the Beach ! A Geneva Watch ! !â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Leigh and Edith went up the street as quickly as they could, and as soon as he had finished his speech, Mrs. Leigh beckoned to him to come and speak to her. He came out of the crowd, and she told him the story. Edith could not hear what either of them said, as they were both so much taller than her. Presently, the town-crier went back to the crowd, and Mrs. Leigh asked Edith if she would like to stop and hear what he was going to say. Edith of course said she would like it very much, so holding her mammaâ\\x80\\x99s hand tight, she went into the crowd and waited. â\\x80\\x98 Tingâ\\x80\\x94aâ\\x80\\x94ring ! Tingâ\\x80\\x94aâ\\x80\\x94ring ! Tingâ\\x80\\x94aâ\\x80\\x94ling ! Lost ! Lost ! ! Lost ! ! ! Flown out of window ! A Little Canary !â\\x80\\x99A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 77 â\\x80\\x98 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s mine,â\\x80\\x99 Edith could not help saying to a little boy standing next her, and she felt so proud and delighted, that she quite forgot what a sad thing it was to lose her poor little dicky-bird. â\\x80\\x98 Whoever will bring it To 9, Bouverie Square, Will have Five Shillings Reward 1â\\x80\\x99 Oh dear ! what a shout ! Edith had not ex 172 pected it would be so loud, and she nearly screamed, for she was so near the man that his voice quite went through her head. But she laughed because all the rest did, and then she stayed quite still, to hear what would come next. For she quite expected someone in the crowd to call out : â\\x80\\x98 Here it is ! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got it ! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve found it.â\\x80\\x99 But no one spoke, and after a minute the town- crier moved on, and a good many boys followed him. The rest of the crowd went their different ways, and Edith and her mamma were left standing alone in the middle of the street. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid no one has found Dicky, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith, sadly. â\\x80\\x98Oh! my darling, you must not be in such a hurry. You know the man will have to go into a great many streets before everyone in Folkestone hears that Dicky is lost. We must not expect to know till this evening, at any rate, if then.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What a long time f sighed Edith. â\\x80\\x98 It wonâ\\x80\\x99t seem long,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh ; â\\x80\\x98 we shall78 THE T0 WN-CRIERj OR, not go home till tea time, and meantime you may have a donkey, if you like.â\\x80\\x99 Edith was delighted at the thoughts of a ride on a donkey, and she ran on towards the stand to choose a nice one. CHAPTER V. LEAVING Edith to enjoy her donkey-ride, we must now go back to poor Mrs. Brown and her little girl, who you will remember Edith so unaccountably lost sight of in the morning. You will remember that she left them standing outside the shop-door while she ran in to ask her mamma to give them some money. You will remember also that when she came back, bringing her mamma with her, the barrow and Mrs. Brown and the little girl had all disap 172 peared, and that poor Edith was much disappointed, and also puzzled as to what could have become of them. Well ! you will know now what Edith was long 172 ing to find out, for I am going to tell you. Directly Edith had gone into the shop, Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s mother spied a boy beckoning to her from the corner of a little side street, and, being afraid to lose a chance of selling some of her vegetables, she hurried after him. She turned the corner, and followed him up theA LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 79 little street, where she found the wife of a tobac 172 conist waiting at her door to buy a cauliflower. The cauliflower cost a penny, and the tobac conistâ\\x80\\x99s wife gave a sixpence and asked for change. Poor Mrs. Brown having only sold a vegetable marrow all day, had not got any change, so the boy had to be sent to get some. All this made a delay, and meanwhile Mrs. Leigh and Edith had passed down the big street looking for the barrow, and had not been able to find it. Then by the time Mrs. Brown and Nancy had got back into the street, Edith and her mamma had got still further away, and had joined the crowd round the town-crier. So it was not very likely that while they were listening to him, and that tremendously loud â\\x80\\x98 Lost ! Lost ! ! Lost ! ! !â\\x80\\x99 was sounding in their ears, they should hear poor Mrs. Brownâ\\x80\\x99s little cry of â\\x80\\x98 Any pears or nuts to-day ! Chickweed and groundsel for singing-birds ! Or.turf for larks !â\\x80\\x99 You know the story of the Three Bears ? Well, the town-crierâ\\x80\\x99s voice was as much louder than Mrs. Brownâ\\x80\\x99s as the big bearâ\\x80\\x99s was louder than the little wee bearâ\\x80\\x99s. â\\x80\\x98 Who has been lying on my bed ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Who has been lying on my bed ?â\\x80\\x99THE TO WN-CRIERj OR, So you may just fancy. Mrs. Brown soon left the upper part of the town, and went down to the streets where the poorer people live. And when she had been right through these she turned out of the town into the high road by the railway that led to her home. Till then she had been so busy looking up at the windows, and in at the doors, so as to be sure of seeing anyone who might put their heads out and cry â\\x80\\x98 Stop ! we want to buy,â\\x80\\x99 that she had not noticed how slowly little Nancy was following her, nor how pale and tired she looked. But now she began to wonder why the child hung behind so, and stopped and turned round. â\\x80\\x98 Are you tired, Nannie ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, mammy, not so very For Nancy was a patient little girl, and never complained or made a fuss about herself. â\\x80\\x98 Hungry, then V â\\x80\\x98 Noâ\\x80\\x94not so very, very! â\\x80\\x98Feeling ill, my dearie ?â\\x80\\x99 * No, mammy, not so ve-ry v-e-r-y.â\\x80\\x99 But poor little Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s voice was very shaky. â\\x80\\x98 Why, youâ\\x80\\x99re crying, child. What is it ? Tell mammy.â\\x80\\x99 And Mrs. Brown left the barrow in the road, sat down by the wayside, and took Nancy in her arms. â\\x80\\x98 Now tell mammy all about it.â\\x80\\x99 The funny thing was, that just at that moment, in the big house in Bouverie Square, Mrs. Leigh was taking her little girl into her lap, and trying to findA LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 81 out why she was crying, and asking herâ\\x80\\x94not if she was hungry or tired, or feeling illâ\\x80\\x94but if she had tumbled down on the stairs, or been fright 172 ened at anything, or not been able to find her nurse. And Edith was answering very much in the same way as Nancy, or rather not answering at all, but crying, and crying on. Now Edith was crying because she had lost her canary, but Nancy was crying because she felt weak, and ill, and hungry and miserable. She said, â\\x80\\x98No, mammy, not so veryâ\\x80\\x99 when her mother asked her if she was tired, or hungry, or ill, because she really did not exactly know, poor child, what it was that was making her cry. The truth was she had had very little to eat for several days, and had been tramping about the streets after the barrow ever since six oâ\\x80\\x99clock that morning without any dinnerâ\\x80\\x94so it was no wonder she felt weak and sad and ready to cry. What a difference between Edith sitting down to her mince and mashed potato, and poor little hungry, dinnerless Nancy ! And yet I dare say Edith thought no one could be more miserable than she was. It is often like this with all children ; you think no one is so unhappy as you are, when you cannot get what you want, or are disappointed about some 172 thing ; but if you only knew how much better off you are than many poor little children, who never get what they want, and are disappointed all day 682 THE TO WN-CRIERj OR, long, you would feel quite ashamed of making miseries out of your little troubles. Perhaps if Edith could have seen poor Nancy lying in her motherâ\\x80\\x99s arms by the roadside, she would have felt ashamed of crying so much, just because a little bird had flown away. Still,we must not be too hard upon Edith, because she had something to cry about ; for it was a sad thing to lose her dear little canary ; but really some little boys and girls cry for no reason at all ; perhaps because somebody says something they donâ\\x80\\x99t like, or because they cannot do exactly what they want, or some foolish reason of that kind. And it is for such children that I cannot feel at all sorry, and for whom I can make no excuse. It is the same thing about little hurts as it is about little troubles. I dare say some of you, when you tumble down and graze your elbows or your knees, or bump your foreheads, make a great fuss, particularly if there is a little blood to show. But just think for a moment of the cuts and bruises, and even broken bones, that children get who are not taken such care of as you are, and children too who have no mammas or nurses near, to put on pomade-divine, or soft rag, or sticking- plaster. Next time you hurt yourself, and are going to make a great to-do about it, just think of all this. And the next time, too, that you have a little cold, or headache, and are inclined to make a fuss aboutA LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 83 it, and to think yourself very bad, give a thought to the many poor little sick children in miserable beds, who are so much worse than you, and yet have so much less care and attention. Now we must go back to poor Mrs. Brown, sitting by the wayside, with her sick child in her lap. â\\x80\\x98What am I to do for you, my poor little girl?â\\x80\\x99 she said, as she recked Nancy to and fro in her arms ; â\\x80\\x98 could you eat a little bit of bread if I were to buy it for you, or do you feel so bad that you would like to go home to bed ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I should like to go home,â\\x80\\x99 said Nancy, â\\x80\\x98only then you wonâ\\x80\\x99t be able to sell.â\\x80\\x99 Now Nancy was longing to go home and lie down, only she was such a brave unselfish little girl that she was ready to give up her wish for her motherâ\\x80\\x99s sake. â\\x80\\x98 I may as well go home,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Brown ; â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t see that Iâ\\x80\\x99m likely to sell anything more to-day. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been through all the most likely streets, and nobody seems inclined to buy. Iâ\\x80\\x99m beginning to think my vegetables are not fine enough to take peopleâ\\x80\\x99s fancy, for I seem to sell less and less every day. Of course I canâ\\x80\\x99t afford to buy the best. I sometimes think Iâ\\x80\\x99ll give up the barrow altogether, and take to some other way of making a living; but what to take to I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. Eh! Nancy ?â\\x80\\x99 Nancy didnâ\\x80\\x99t answer, and didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to be listening. Her mother looked at her, to see if she was asleep. 6â\\x80\\x9428 4 THE T0 WN- CRIERj OR, She was lying back with her eyes shut, and a faint smile was playing over her face. â\\x80\\x98What are you smiling at, Nancy ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Hush ! mother,â\\x80\\x99 whispered Nancy, still keeping her eyes closed. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m listening to a little bird that keeps singing, singing so sweetly ! Itâ\\x80\\x99s so pretty, mammy dear !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Bird singing !â\\x80\\x99 repeated Mrs. Brown, â\\x80\\x98 you must be dreaming, child, there are no singing birds now; why, itâ\\x80\\x99s October, you know. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a boy whistling you hear, or a barrow organ, or something of that sort.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But, mammy ! do just listen, for I hear it so plainly, and I know itâ\\x80\\x99s a bird. Hark ! there it is again.â\\x80\\x99 Sure enough, the trilling notes of a little bird sounded in the still air. The song seemed to come from the road, and yet there were no trees near. â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s very strange,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Brown, â\\x80\\x98it is a bird, and no mistake. It must be near the barrow; thatâ\\x80\\x99s where the sound comes from. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go and see if thereâ\\x80\\x99s anything there.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Take care, mammy,â\\x80\\x99 said little Nancy, in an agony ; â\\x80\\x98 go softly, or perhaps youâ\\x80\\x99ll frighten it away. Carry me with you, I want so much to come too.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Brown took the little girl in her arms, and went on tiptoe up to where the barrow was stand 172 ing in the road. There was a large heap of cauli 172 flowers which at first prevented their seeing any-A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 85 thing, but Nancy eagerly peeped right over the top of it. And there, perched on the side of the cart, peck 172 ing away at the groundsel, and seeming thoroughly to enjoy his meal, wasâ\\x80\\x94a little canary ! â\\x80\\x98 Oh! mammy, mammy! what a dear little yellow bird ! Oh ! won\\'t you catch it and let me take it home ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Take it home !â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed poor Mrs. Brown, in astonishment ; â\\x80\\x98 why, what in the world are we to do with it ? Weâ\\x80\\x99ve no cage, no seed, no nothing.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Thereâ\\x80\\x99s the old broken cage in the shed, mammy, where the magpie used to be. Couldnâ\\x80\\x99t we put him in there, if it was mended up ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But the food, my lamb ; you forget it must eat. And how are we to feed itâ\\x80\\x94we who can hardly feed ourselves ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98The groundsel, mammy,â\\x80\\x99 said Nancy, eagerly; â\\x80\\x98thereâ\\x80\\x99s plenty of it, and he likes it. See how heâ\\x80\\x99s pecking at it now.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But he canâ\\x80\\x99t live always on that, dearie. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not a field bird, you know. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a cage-bird, accus 172 tomed to rape-seed and canary-seed and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what. Besides, it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t belong to us. It must have got out of its cage by accident.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! donâ\\x80\\x99t say no, mammy. Itâ\\x80\\x99ll die if we leave it here.â\\x80\\x99 And Nancy burst into tears. Mrs. Brown had been going to make all sorts of objections still, but Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s pleading voice and streaming eyes made her change her mind.86 THE T0 WN- CRIER ; OR, She was frightened to see how weak and ill the child seemed. She knew Nancy must be feeling very bad to cry so easily, for generally she was the most patient little girl in the world, and the bravest. The only thing she thought of now was how to get home as quickly as possible, and put Nancy to bed and get her something to eat. So, without more ado, she put her down, went quickly up to the little bird, and caught him in her hand. He fluttered and chirruped a little at first, but soon became quiet, for he was, as you know, a tame little fellow, and accustomed to be handled. Mrs. Brown brought him to Nancy, who eagerly held out her little pinafore for him. She then lifted the child, canary and all, on to the barrow, and as quickly as possible wheeled them all home. CHAPTER VI. Mrs. Brownâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98 homeâ\\x80\\x99 consisted of one little room in a little cottage belonging to a poor old market- gardener and his wife. They were good old people, and very kind to Nancy and her mother ; but they were very, very poor, and it was as much as they could do to feed and clothe themselves ; so they were not able to help Mrs. Brown much, though I am sure if they had been rich they would have done so directly.A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 87 Old King, as the market-gardener was called, supplied Mrs. Brown with the vegetables and groundsel that she carried about on her barrow. They grew in his little garden, and what he did not consider good enough for the market, he sold cheap to her. Now, as his finest vegetables were not very fine, you may imagine that those he sold cheap to Mrs. Brown were not very much worth having ; but still, as she could not afford any better, she was glad enough to buy these ; and then old King was so kind about waiting to be paid for them, if Mrs. Brown, as too often happened, had made very little money in the day. There was a little shed in the garden where old King kept his tools, and where he allowed Mrs. Brown to keep her barrow at night. This old shed was Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s favourite playing- place, and she had quite as many happy games there, when she was well and strong, as Edith had in her garden and her summer-house in her beauti 172 ful old home in Kent. You see both Edith and Nancy were companion- less children, and neither of them knew any of the fun of romps with brothers and sisters out of doors, or of games of shop and keeping house, and playing at trains at home. It was from being so much in the shed that little Nancy remembered directly about the old broken bird-cage, for she had seen it hanging there almost as long as she could remember, and had often88 THE TO WN-CRTERj OR, amused herself for hours, watching the money- spiders making their webs between its bars, till at last it seemed as if they joined them all together. The cage had belonged to Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s father, who had been a fisherman, and who had been drowned at sea one stormy night many years ago. He used to keep a magpie in it, but the magpie had pined away, and died soon after its master, for grief, Mrs. Brown used to say, with tears in her eyes ; but others said it was for want of the care and attention the dead fisherman used to bestow upon it, and for which poor Mrs. Brown, doubly poor since her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s death, had no time. Anyhow, it had been dead so long that Nancy did not remember the cage otherwise than as an empty, battered old thing, hanging on an old rusty nail in the darkest part of the shed. So this was the new dwelling-place waiting for master Dicky when he arrived at the little cottage, squeezed up tight in Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s pinafore. Mrs. Brown carried the child into the little room, and laid her down on the bed. Then, at Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s earnest request, she went to the shed to look for the bird-cage. It was, as we have said, in such a dark part, that it was some time before she found it. She hunted about in all the dark holes and corners, and it was not till she had knocked her head against it that she discovered it hanging on the wall. She brought it to the light, and dusted it with her apron, brushing away remorselessly all theA LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 89 money-spiders, and the webs they had spun with such care. It was a big wooden cage, not the least suited to a canary, but though it was very old and battered, it had no holes in it. â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s better than I thought,â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Brown said to herself, and she carried it off to the little room where Nancy lay expecting it. The child was pleased to see it, but she seemed too faint and tired to speak, or to sit up to look at it. Mrs. Brown put it down, and came and took Dicky out of Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s pinafore and popped him into the cage. I think he must have found it rather hot and uncomfortable in Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s pinafore, for he did seem so very pleased to get into the cage. He hopped about and gave several little â\\x80\\x98 To-wheets !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98To- wheets !â\\x80\\x99 Little Nancy opened her eyes and smiled at the sound, but she soon shut them again, for she was very tired. Mrs. Brown put the cage where the child could see it, gave Dicky some water and some groundsel, and then undressed Nancy and put her to bed. â\\x80\\x98 Would you like a little milk and some bread, my lamb ?â\\x80\\x99 she said, as she laid the little sick girl on her pillow. Nancy smiled and nodded. â\\x80\\x98 Well ! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go and buy you some then. I shanâ\\x80\\x99t be long, and Dicky will keep you company while Iâ\\x80\\x99m away.â\\x80\\x99THE TO WN-CRIERj OR, But when she came back with the food, Nancy was too ill to eat it ; she just tasted the milk, but the bread she could not touch. She lay back on her pillow with her eyes closed, and seemed to wish to go to sleep. Mrs. Brown darkened the room, and thinking that if Nancy went to sleep now, she would perhaps wake up hungry a little later, she put the milk care 172 fully by in a little cup, and covered Nancy up. She was going to put Dicky outside the door, for fear he should chirrup and disturb the child ; but the moment she put her hand on the cage, Nancy opened her eyes, and their look seemed to beg that he might not be taken out of her sight. Dicky behaved very well, and was very quiet. The fact was, finding the room dark, he thought night had arrived, so he popped his head under his wing and went to sleep too. But Nancy didnâ\\x80\\x99t sleep as long as Dicky, neither did she wake up and eat, as her mother had hoped and expected. She tossed about and coughed all night long, and was so ill in the morning that Mrs. Brown got old King to go and fetch the doctor as soon as he was up. The doctor came and looked rather grave, and said Nancy would be ill for many days, and that Mrs. Brown must take great care of her. She was ill, he said, from being so tired, and not having enough good food to eat. She would not want much to eat for the nextA LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 91 week or ten days, he said ; but after that, when she was getting better, she would be very hungry, and would have to have beef-tea and milky puddings, and all those kind of things. Poor Mrs. Brown ! She sat for some time after the doctor had gone, with her face hidden in her hands, wondering what she was to do ; and she could not help crying just a little quite quietly to herself. For if Nancy was going to be ill, of course she would not be able to leave her ; and if she did not go out with the barrow, how was she ever to make the money with which the beef-tea and the milky puddings must be bought ? She felt very sad ; so she opened her Bible and began to read. And these were the words she read. â\\x80\\x98 There 172 fore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat or what shall we drink, or wherewithal shall we be clothed ... for your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Brownâ\\x80\\x99s eyes filled with tears of joy as she read, for the words seemed to promise her that God would provide for Nancy, since He knew that she needed many things. And she tried to read some more, for she wanted comfort sadly : but her eyes were dim and the room was dark, so she went to the window to see more clearly. â\\x80\\x98 Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. . . .â\\x80\\x99 The room was so very dark that she stopped92 THE TO WN-CRTER; OR, reading and held the curtain aside for a minute to see better. A flood of sunshine streamed into the room, and Dicky in his joy at seeing the light again, poured forth his trilling song. It seemed to Mrs. Brown like a hymn of praise and thanksgiving. For Dicky was a â\\x80\\x98 fowl of the air,â\\x80\\x99 and he cer 172 tainly had not sowed or reaped, or made any pro 172 vision of food for himself when he flew out of his cage in Bouverie Square. Yet he had found food and shelter. â\\x80\\x98Yet your Heavenly Father feedeth them\\', said Mrs. Brown, still reading. And she blessed the bird for his song, for it made it easier for her to believe that if God had taken thought for a little bird like him, He would take thought for her little Nancy. â\\x80\\x98 Are ye not much better than they ?â\\x80\\x99 she read, and she looked from the child to the canary. She shut the Bible, and drew the curtain. Dicky stopped singing, and she quietly knelt down to pray. She did not feel sad when she got up again, for she was full of hope and trust that God would help her somehow, though she could not see how herself. The promise of the Bible and the song of the bird had made her strong and thankful. So you see it was not for nothing that Dicky had been sent to poor Mrs. Brown. For from that time, all through Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s illness, she never got sad and despairing again.A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. She hoped and trusted on, and left the morrow to take care of itself. And if ever she felt doubt 172 ful as to how she was to get the beef tea and the milky puddings when the day came that Nancy would be hungry enough to want them, she would look at Dicky eating his groundsel and say to her 172 self, â\\x80\\x98 Yet your Heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they ?â\\x80\\x99 Day after day went by in the little dark room, and still Nancy tossed about on her sick bed, and still her poor patient mother sat by, watching for the first sign of her getting better, and wondering when it would come. Day after day Dicky still hopped about in his wooden cage, constantly fancying it was night, and so eating little and sleeping a great deal. Day after day, too, he fed on groundsel, and began to get rather thin for want of the seed and sand to which he was accustomed. And all the time the town-crier was going up and down and in and out of all the streets in Folke 172 stone, ringing his bell, and calling out that a little canary was 1 Lost ! Lost ! ! Lost ! ! !â\\x80\\x99 And day after day, every morning and every night, poor Edith was hoping, and longing, and waiting and watching, for some one to bring him to Bouverie Square.94 TUE T0 IVA\\'- CRIER; OR, CHAPTER VII. At last Nancy began to get better, and to be able to have a little light in her room, and to take notice of what was going on round her. The first thing she asked was for Dicky to be put on the bed close to her, that she might see him hopping about in his cage. Very soon he learnt to know her, or else perhaps he mistook her for his own little mistress, because little girls in bed are very much alike, for he began to kiss her through the bars of his cage, and do all the other little tricks Edith had taught him. Nancy loved him more and more every day, and her mother often used to say she was sure Nancy would not have got well near so quickly if it had not been for Dicky. Mrs. Brown was grieved to see, when the light was first let into the room again, how very thin both the child and the bird had grown. She feared Dicky was beginning to miss all the seed and sand and sugar he was used to, though she had done her best to spare a penny every now and then to buy him a little canary-seed, for she had felt very grateful to the little bird for the use he had been to her during Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s illness. The time had now quite come for Nancy to have the beef tea and the milky puddings. She was getting very hungry, and constantly asked for food. So, as she was well enough to be left a little, Mrs.A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. Brown made up her mind one Sunday evening that she would go out with her barrow again the next day, and try to make a little money. She went down to old King the first thing on Monday morning, and asked him if he would let her have some pears, nuts, groundsel, etc. She told him at the same time that she could not pay him anything for them now, as Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s illness had cost her every penny she had, either in the house or in the savingsâ\\x80\\x99 bank, but that she hoped to be able to pay him that evening if she was pretty lucky during the day. Old King was very kind about it, but said he hoped she would not fail to pay him that night, as he was particularly poor himself just now. Mrs. Brown willingly promised to do her very best, filled her barrow, and then went up to say good-bye to Nancy. The child was sitting up in bed talking to Dicky, whose cage was on her bed. She was better, but very weak ; and looked as if she wanted soup, and jelly, and wine, and all sorts of good things that her poor mother could not afford to give her. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m so hungry, mammy, and Dicky too,â\\x80\\x99 she said smiling, but in a very weak voice. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad to hear it, my dearie, for it shows youâ\\x80\\x99re better; and now I\\'m going off to sell as much as ever I can, and get you a nice bit of meat to make you some broth.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And Dicky some seed, mammy.â\\x80\\x9996 THE TOWN-CRIERj OR, â\\x80\\x98 Yes, Dicky some seed,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Brown, as she kissed Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s little pale face. â\\x80\\x98 If you want any 172 thing, give Mrs. King a call. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s promised to look after you while Iâ\\x80\\x99m away ; God bless you, dearie.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Good-bye, dear mammy,â\\x80\\x99 said Nancy. â\\x80\\x98Swâ\\x80\\x94eet !â\\x80\\x99 said Dicky. f Thatâ\\x80\\x99s Dickyâ\\x80\\x99s good-bye,â\\x80\\x99 smiled Nancy. And Mrs. Brown started off. She was glad to feel the fresh sea-air in her face after being shut up so long, and the walk into the town did her good. She soon found herself in the familiar streets, passing all the shops and houses that she had not seen since the day Nancy was taken ill. She fell into her old ways again quite naturally, looking up at the windows and in at the doors so as to be sure of not missing anyone who might want to buy, and calling out as usualâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 Any pears or nuts to-day ; chickweed and groundsel for sing- ing-birds, or turf for larks !â\\x80\\x99 It was not near such a fine day as it had been when she was last out selling. It was cold and damp, and inclined to rain. There were not many people out, and those there were did not stand about looking at the barrow, as sometimes hap 172 pened, but walked straight on, as if they thought it too unpleasant a day for dawdling. Mrs. Brown began to get rather sad as half-an- hour, and then an hour went by, and nobody bought anything of her. She went at last to the little sideA LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. street where she had sold the cauliflower to the tobacconistâ\\x80\\x99s wife, in the hope that she might per 172 suade her to buy another. The woman was at her door, and Mrs. Brown hurried up to her : but alas ! when she got there, she found that anotherha.rro\\\\xr was standing at the door, and that the tobacconistâ\\x80\\x99s wife was buying veget 172 ables of another person. Poor Mrs. Brown ! she did just complain a little at this ; but the tobacconistâ\\x80\\x99s wife answered that it was so long since she had seen anything of her, that she had made up her mind she had given up her business, and so had been obliged to trans 172 fer her custom to someone else. Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s mother turned away without a word. She could not steady her voice to explain about her sick child, and even if she did, what good would it do ? Back again into the big streets ; up and down, up and down, wearily cryingâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 Any pears or nuts to-day ; chickweed and groundsel for singing-birds, or turf for larks !â\\x80\\x99 She felt, as she watched the people hurrying along, that she could kneel down to them and beg them to buy. Hour after hour passed, and she sold nothing at all : not even a pear or a bit of groundsel. She was at her witsâ\\x80\\x99 end. She could not go home till she had made some money, for Nancy must have her broth, or she would get ill again. And yet how little use it seemed staying out. 798 THE T0 WN- CRIER; OR, She looked sadly at the rosy-faced children going by with their nurses on their way home to a good tea, and thought of her little pale Nancy at home, waiting for the food that did not seem likely to come. As she stood, a little boy and girl with their nurse stopped for a minute and looked at the barrow. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Nana !â\\x80\\x99 said the little boy,â\\x80\\x98how I should like to buy some of that turf for my lark 1â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ve no money this week, you know, Master Edward,â\\x80\\x99 said the nurse. â\\x80\\x98 I think you forget that you got so few marks from Miss Cust last week that you had no pennies on Saturday.â\\x80\\x99 The little boy had evidently quite forgotten. He looked very grave. â\\x80\\x98 Oh dear ! oh dear !â\\x80\\x99 he sighed, â\\x80\\x98how I wish Iâ\\x80\\x99d been more attentive, and tried harder !â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Brown wished so too. She would have been so thankful if the little boy could have bought some of her turf. By not doing what is right we punish other people as well as ourselves. If the little boy had been good at his lessons he would have got his pennies, the lark would have got his turf, Mrs. Brown would have made some money, and Nancy would have got her soup. â\\x80\\x98 Donâ\\x80\\x99t cry, Eddy,â\\x80\\x99 said the little girl to her brother. â\\x80\\x98 / got my pennies this week, you know, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll buy you the turf.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Why, Miss Amy,â\\x80\\x99 said the nurse, â\\x80\\x98you spent nearly all your pennies on the beach just now,A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 99 buying shells and things you didnâ\\x80\\x99t the least want. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure you have not enough left for the turf. I told you at the time that you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do with them when youâ\\x80\\x99d got them, and that it was a pity to waste your money on them, but you always want to buy everything you see.â\\x80\\x99 The little girl looked very much ashamed, and said nothing. â\\x80\\x98 Still, I think youâ\\x80\\x99ve got one left,â\\x80\\x99 said the nurse; 1 at least, I know the man gave you some change.â\\x80\\x99 The little girl began hunting in her pocket, and even turned it inside out, but there was no penny there. â\\x80\\x98What was that you were throwing about on the beach?â\\x80\\x99 said the nurse. â\\x80\\x98You were tossing something up in the air.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m dreadfully afraid it was the penny,â\\x80\\x99 said the little girl, blushing, â\\x80\\x98and I think I dropped it. What a great bother ! I wish I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I hope it will be a lesson to you,â\\x80\\x99 said the nurse, gravely, â\\x80\\x98not to be so careless with money, when there are so many poor people starving for want of it. It seems dreadful for children to be tossincr about and losing what would make many a poor person happy.â\\x80\\x99 The children looked at Mrs. Brownâ\\x80\\x99s sad face, and felt what their nurse said was true. They were very much disappointed, and walked on with 172 out speaking. Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s mother was dreadfully disappointed too. It was getting late, and beginning to rain. She felt 7-2IOO THE TO WK-CRlERj OR, it was no use staying out any longer, and yet, how could she go back to Nancy and old King without having made a farthing ? No soup for Nancy, no seed for Dicky, no money to pay old King. And, as the thought of her sick child lying in her bed, weak and hungry, came upon her, the tears rushed into the motherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, and quite in despair she leant against the barrow and covered her face with her hands. But even as she wept, the words which had com 172 forted her before, when she was in trouble, came into her head to comfort her again. â\\x80\\x98 Behold the fowls of the air . . . Are ye not much better than they? . . . Your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.â\\x80\\x99 Yes, God knew that Nancy wanted soup and nourishment; He had taken care of Dicky, He would take care of Nancy too. Soothed by the promise of the Bible, Mrs. Brown raised her head and wiped away her tears. And as she did so there fell upon her ear the sound of a clanging bell. Tingâ\\x80\\x94aâ\\x80\\x94ring ! Tingâ\\x80\\x94aâ\\x80\\x94ring !; Tingâ\\x80\\x94aâ\\x80\\x94ring ! Filled with a sudden thought, she followed the sound as quickly as she could wheel the barrow along, and turned the corner of the street.A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 101 Tingâ\\x80\\x94aâ\\x80\\x94ring ! Tingâ\\x80\\x94aâ\\x80\\x94ring ! Tingâ\\x80\\x94aâ\\x80\\x94ring ! â\\x80\\x98 Lost ! Lost ! Lost ! Flown out of Window, A Little Canary ! ! !â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Brown jumped as if she had been shot, not at the sudden shout, but with the sudden hope that filled her breast. Pressing both hands upon her heart, to still its beating, she strained every nerve to hear and take in what was coming. â\\x80\\x98 Whoever will bring it To 9, Bouverie Square, Will have Five Shillings Reward ! !â\\x80\\x99 The small crowd of boys round the town-crier jumped and laughed as usual ; the town-crier him 172 self moved on, and Mrs. Brown was left standing alone in the street. I leave you children to imagine how she felt. I leave you to picture to yourselves how her cheeks flushed, her eyes sparkled, and her face shone with joy. Five shillings ! Why, five shillings to her, at that moment, was like a hundred pounds, for would not five shillings buy everything she wanted, and could a hundred thousand pounds do more ? Broth for Nancy for days and days and days to come ; milky puddings for as long as she would102 THE TOWN- CRIER ; OR, want them ; money to pay old King over and over again ; sand, seed, and even sugar for Dicky, â\\x80\\x98 Oh, thank God ! thank God !â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, when she could find voice to speak. â\\x80\\x98 He knew I had need of all these things/ She must hurry home as fast as her legs could carry her. She must not lose a moment in fetching Dicky and taking him to Bouverie Square. In another hour the five shillings would be hers, and Nancy would have her hot soup before bed 172 time. You never saw anyone look happier than Mrs. Brown, as she trudged along the wet streets. It began to rain rather heavily, but she did not feel as if she cared about it, though she had on a thin shawl and no umbrella. All she thought of was how to get home as quickly as possible. Hot and breathless, she arrived at the little cottage, and hurried indoors. CHAPTER VIII. â\\x80\\x98The childâ\\x80\\x99s asleep,â\\x80\\x99said old Mrs. King, looking out from her door. â\\x80\\x98 Sheâ\\x80\\x99s sadly in need of some broth, I fancy ; for sheâ\\x80\\x99s weak-like, and very hungry. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s eaten all the bread and drank all the milk you left for her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Sheâ\\x80\\x99s going to get plenty now,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Brown,A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 103 joyfully. * Iâ\\x80\\x99m very thankful to you for minding her. Has she wearied for me ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She would have wearied, I think, if it had not been for the little bird,â\\x80\\x99 answered the old woman ; â\\x80\\x98 but he seems a real companion for her. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s been playing with him off and on all day. Nothing would do but the cage must be on the bed, and sheâ\\x80\\x99s been kissing him through the bars. Bless her heart ! it was pretty to see her. Kiss, she calls it, but to me it seems more of a peck ; for she made me put my face down to see â\\x80\\x9c what a sweet kiss he gave,â\\x80\\x9d but he made my lip bleed, I know. But I wonâ\\x80\\x99t keep you, Mrs. Brown, for she ought to have some food soon, and youâ\\x80\\x99ll be wanting to get it ready.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Brown went upstairs rather slowly after this, and she did not have quite such a happy face as she had had before. For the old womanâ\\x80\\x99s words made her remember what in her first great joy she had forgotten ; and that was, that the news she was bringing would not be altogether good news for Nancy. She began to dread having to tell the child that Dicky must go, for she was afraid that it would make her dreadfully unhappy. She opened the door very softly, and went in. Nancy was lying asleep, and Dicky, in his cage close by, was calling â\\x80\\x98 Swâ\\x80\\x94eet ! Swâ\\x80\\x94eetlâ\\x80\\x99 every moment, as if asking her to wake up and play. She must have heard his voice in her dreams, for she had a smile on her little thin face. Mrs. Brown104 THE TO WN- CRIER ; OR, stood at the foot of the bed for a minute, and her face grew very sad. For, first of all, it struck her how very ill Nancy was looking, and then her heart sank at the thought of having to tell her sad news the moment she woke. And yet it must be done, and done quickly too, for there was no time to be lost. It was getting late, and if she did not soon take the canary to Bouverie Square she might find the house shut up ; and then there would be no five shillings to-night, and no soup for Nancy. This thought made her braver than anything else. Food the child must have, and that soon ; for she looked terribly pale and weak. â\\x80\\x98 How would it be ?â\\x80\\x99 thought Mrs. Brown to her 172 self, â\\x80\\x98 if I took Dicky away now while Nancy is asleep, and then tell her afterwards all about it ?â\\x80\\x99 She made up her mind to try. She felt almost like a thief as she crept on tiptoe to the bed, and softly moved away the bird-cage. She walked to the door, cage in hand, creeping along like a cat, afraid almost to breathe, for fear of waking Nancy. She turned the handle very, very softly, and was almost out of the room, when what should Dicky do but begin to sing ! And he sang so loud and so clear that Nancy stirred in her sleep, and then opened her eyes. â\\x80\\x98 Dicky,â\\x80\\x99 she said, missing him in a moment from her side, â\\x80\\x98 where are you ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Here he is, dearie,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Brown, hastily re-A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. turning into the room, and she put the cage back on the bed. She sat down by Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s side and began to talk, hoping that the child would ask her a lot of ques 172 tions about what she had been doing all day, and whether she had bought any seed for Dicky ; be 172 cause then it would be easier to tell her that Dicky must go to a place where he would have as much seed, and sand, and sugar as he wanted : and Nancy was such a kind, unselfish little girl, that perhaps, for Dickyâ\\x80\\x99s sake, she would be glad he should go. But Nancy did not seem inclined to talk, or to ask questions. She shut her eyes again directly she found Dicky was safe at her side, and seemed inclined to go to sleep. What was Mrs. Brown to do ? It was getting darker every moment, and there was no time to spare. Bouverie Square was a long way off, and if she intended to go, she ought not to delay another moment. So at last, in despair, she bent over Nancy, and said, rather suddenly : â\\x80\\x98Do you know, Nannie, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve found out where Dicky comes from ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 whispered Nancy, in a weak little voice, â\\x80\\x98 I know too. Mrs. King told me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How in the world should she know,â\\x80\\x99 muttered Mrs. Brown to herself, â\\x80\\x98 and if she knew, why didnâ\\x80\\x99t she tell me long ago ?â\\x80\\x99 But she did not say this so that Nancy should hear.io6 THE TO WN-CRIERj OR, Still, she was very glad to think that Nancy should be a little prepared for what was coming, and she went on more boldly : â\\x80\\x98 She told you, did she ? Well, dearie, donâ\\x80\\x99t you think I ought to take him back ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 All that long way, mammy ? Why ! you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s not so very far,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Brown, â\\x80\\x98 and the cage is not so very heavy.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But youâ\\x80\\x99d have to go in a ship, mammy.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 In a ship !â\\x80\\x99 repeated poor Mrs. Brown, â\\x80\\x98 why, youâ\\x80\\x99re dreaming, Nancy dear.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m quite awake,â\\x80\\x99 answered Nancy, â\\x80\\x98 but I know youâ\\x80\\x99d have to go in a ship, because Mrs. King said so. It would take you many days and nights to get there, she said, tossing about on the sea all the time.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Why ! where in the world did she say Dicky came from, then ?â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed the astonished Mrs. Brown. â\\x80\\x98 All the way from the Canary Islands,â\\x80\\x99 answered Nancy, sleepily ; â\\x80\\x98 such a long way off, mammy. Out by a place called Africa, I think she said.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Bless my heart !â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Brown, â\\x80\\x98 I didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean that ! I meant I had found out where he had come from the day we found him ; how he had flown out of a window in Bouverie Square, and how the people he belongs to are offering five shillings reward to anyone who will bring him back. And donâ\\x80\\x99t you see, my little Nannie, that I thinkA LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 107 I ought to take him back, seeing that he rightfully belongs to them, and not to us.â\\x80\\x99 No answer from Nancy, no sound, while her mother talked on, till Mrs. Brown was interrupted by a great sob, and hastily pulling down the sheets, she found Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s pillow wet with tears, and the child lying on her face, quite choked with trying to keep down her sobs. Then she began to cough, and between coughing and crying, and being so weak, she got quite ex 172 hausted, and poor Mrs. Brown was frightened. She saw Nancy was too ill still to understand that, as the bird belonged to someone else, it was not right to keep it ; so all she could do was to promise her that if only she would stop crying, she would say no more about taking Dicky away. Nancy stopped directly ; and weak and worn- out as she was, she soon fell asleep. Mrs. Brown wondered what was to be done now ! She felt that it was wrong to keep the canaryâ\\x80\\x99s master or mistress in ignorance of his safety another night after he or she had been searching for him nearly a fortnight. She felt also quite sure that in the morning, Nancy, who was always such a good little girl, would let the bird go quietly ; and so at last she made up her mind to go to Bouverie Square, tell her story, and promise to bring back Dicky the next day. They would be cruel people indeed, if, afterio8 THE TO WN-CRlERj OR, hearing about her sick child, they still insisted on having their bird back to-night. And if they were kind, was there not a chance of their giving her the five shillings at once ? She knelt down and prayed that God would soften their hearts towards her; and then she put on her bonnet and went down to ask Mrs. King to give a look at Nancy while she was away. Out again into the cold, wet streets, with a thin shawl and no umbrella. It was nearly dark before she got to 9, Bouverie Square. She rang the bell with a trembling hand, for she was getting very nervous as to what kind of per 172 son Dickyâ\\x80\\x99s owner might prove to be. She hoped very much it might turn out he belonged to a lady, and particularly a lady with children of her own, as then she would be sure to be sorry for her little Nancy. The door was opened by a footman. â\\x80\\x98 Can I see the lady of the house ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. What do you want ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Then there is a lady,â\\x80\\x99 thought Mrs. Brown to herself. â\\x80\\x98Tell the lady, please,â\\x80\\x99 she said out loud, â\\x80\\x98that a woman wishes to see her who has found her canary-bird.â\\x80\\x99 The footman instantly opened the door wide, and told Mrs. Brown to sit down in the hall, while he went to tell his mistress. He soon came back, and showed her into anA LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. empty room, saying the lady would be down in a few moments. Mrs. Brown looked eagerly round the little room after the footman was gone, as if she thought she could judge by its appearance whether the lady were kind or not. There was a doll on the sofa, a little girlâ\\x80\\x99s straw hat on the table. Her hopes rose. â\\x80\\x98 If she has a little girl, she will feel for mine,â\\x80\\x99 she thought to herself. In another moment the door opened, and Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s mother was face to face with Edithâ\\x80\\x99s mamma. CHAPTER IX. And now we must see what Edith has been doing all this time. We left her running on to the stand to choose a nice donkey. She found only one left, so of course she had not much choice. However, he was a very nice donkey, and not a bit tired or lazy, so she had a capital gallop on the road that leads from Folkestone to Sandgate. It was past five oâ\\x80\\x99clock before she got home. After tea she went down into the drawing-room, where her papa and mamma were sitting. â\\x80\\x98 Has anyone been with Dicky, mamma ?â\\x80\\x99 was her first question.no THE TOWN- CRIER ; OR, â\\x80\\x98 Not yet,â\\x80\\x99 answered Mrs. Leigh. â\\x80\\x98 Oh dear ! oh dear !â\\x80\\x99 said Edith, â\\x80\\x98 and the nightâ\\x80\\x99s coming on, and what will poor Dicky do ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Whatâ\\x80\\x99s all this ?â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Leigh. â\\x80\\x98 Come here, and tell me all about it.â\\x80\\x99 Edith got on her papaâ\\x80\\x99s lap, and began telling him the sad story of the loss of poor Dicky, and how they had told the town-crier to call it out all over Folkestone, and how, still, Dicky had not been found. And the story took so long telling, and her papa had so many questions to ask before he could quite understand it all, that bed-time came directly Edith had finished. She begged hard to be allowed to sit up a little longer, just in case someone should come to the door with Dicky, and her mamma gave her leave. At every ring at the door Edith jumped up and ran to the window, and every time it was a fresh disappointment. First it was a parcel, and then it was the post 172 man, and then it was the newspaper-boy ; and at last she decided to stay at the window altogether, so as to see the people before they got up to the door. Her papa came and stood with her, and together they watched everybody that went by, to see if they were going to ring at the bell. But although there were several more rings, no one came with the canary, and at last it got too dark to see, and Mrs. Leigh said Edith must really not stay up any longer.\\'A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. m Poor Edith began to cry, and said she could not bear to think of Dicky all by himself in the dark, without any cage to sleep in, nor any food to eat. But you children who have read the other part of this story, know very well that Edith need not have made herself unhappy, because Dicky had got a cage to sleep in, and plenty of groundsel to eat. However, she could not guess that, and knew nothing about little Nancy and her mother ; so she went up to bed with a heavy heart, and begged her nurse to draw the curtain over the empty bird 172 cage, for she could not bear to see it. The next morning she went out with her mamma directly after breakfast, and they followed the town- crier, and asked him if he had heard anything of the canary. Of course he said no, and Edith got sadder than ever. There seemed nothing but disappointment for her, for when, after talking to the town-crier, she and her mamma went to see jf they could find the â\\x80\\x98 little girl with the sorrowful eyes â\\x80\\x99 that Edith had taken such a fancy to, I need not say she was no 172 where to be seen. The day passed on, and the evening came, and still there was no news of Dicky. Edith and her papa stood at the window till seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock, watch 172 ing the passers-by, but of course no one brought the canary. It was just like the evening before : first some parcels, then the postman, then the112 THE TO WN- CRIER; OR, newspaper-boy, and Edith went to bed almost more unhappy than she had been yesterday. And so it went on day after day. Poor Edith ! Dicky was a sad loss to her, for as she had no brothers nor sisters, she was accustomed to make him quite a companion. He was, as you know, her favourite of all her pets ; she loved all his pretty little ways, and she missed so the kiss he used to give her every morning through the bars of his cage. Above all, she sadly missed the beautiful song that he used to pour out to her every morning directly she was awake. At last she began to be afraid something terrible must have happened to Dicky. This idea took hold of her on the very Monday that Mrs. Brown was selling in the streets for the first time since Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s illness. It so happened that Edith had had rather a long dull afternoon, for it was too damp for her to stay out, and her mamma had been spending the day with some friends of hers. So Edith had had plenty of time to think about Dicky, and to wonder what could have become of him. When Mrs. Leigh came home about six oâ\\x80\\x99clock, she found Edith in the nursery, standing on a chair at the window, mournfully watching the rain-drops trickling down the window-pane, and when Mrs. Leigh came close, she saw drops, that were not rain 172 drops, trickling down Edithâ\\x80\\x99s face.A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 113 Mrs. Leigh did not say anything, but she put her arm round the little girl, and gave her a kiss. Edith hid her face on her mammaâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m so dull without Dicky, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98And is that what makes you cry ?â\\x80\\x99 asked her mamma. â\\x80\\x98No, not all,â\\x80\\x99said Edith; â\\x80\\x98itâ\\x80\\x99s something worse than that.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Tell me, darling ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m so afraid heâ\\x80\\x99s been eaten up by some horrid greedy, cruel, wicked cat,â\\x80\\x99 sobbed Edith, â\\x80\\x98 and I canâ\\x80\\x99t help crying whenever I think of it.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Leigh felt very sorry for the poor little girl, and hardly knew how to comfort her, for she was very much afraid herself that something dreadful had happened to Dicky. It seemed so strange, if he had been found, that they should have heard nothing of him for ten days. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, mamma ! mamma ! I hate cats. I should like to kill them all, and then they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t eat our dear little birds ; why should they, when theyâ\\x80\\x99ve got so many other nice things to eatâ\\x80\\x94catâ\\x80\\x99s meat, and all sorts of delicious things ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, darling, it is their nature, you know, and we must not be any more angry with them than we might be with ourselves for eating chickens and sheep, and even poor little pigeons. You might just as well say papa and I ought to be killed for having rabbit soup for dinner to-night, when there are so many other nice things we might have, as 8114 THE TOWN-CRIERj OR, that poor cats are to be killed for eating their natural food. Which is most cruel, Edith, to kill a cat, or to kill a bird ? I think my little girl is the cruellest of all,â\\x80\\x99 she said, laughing ; â\\x80\\x98 for she wants to kill Â«//cats because she fancies one cat has killed her little bird. Have you been thinking about this all day, Edie ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes/ said Edith, sadly, â\\x80\\x98 all day long, except when Iâ\\x80\\x99ve thought of two other things.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And what were they, darling ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 That Dicky had perhaps been blown into the sea,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith, with a quavering voice, â\\x80\\x98 and drowned quite dead ; or else that some naughty person had found him, and sold him to some horrid bird-man, who had killed him and stuffed him, and stuck him up in his shop window. Iâ\\x80\\x99m so afraid some day I shall see Dicky fixed on a false branch, with wire feet and bead eyes, and it makes me quite afraid to look into any shop window ; and oh ! I feel so unhappy, mamma.â\\x80\\x99 And Edith burst into tears again. â\\x80\\x98 It is very sad for you, my poor little girl,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh, taking her into her lap ; â\\x80\\x98 you must try and not think about it, if you can.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If I could only know he was safe and happy, sobbed Edith, â\\x80\\x98 I think I could quite make up my mind never to see him again ; but itâ\\x80\\x99s so dreadful thinking of all the things that may have happened to him.â\\x80\\x99 Just at that moment came a tap at the nursery - door.A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 115 â\\x80\\x98 A \\'person wishes to see Mrs. Leigh,â\\x80\\x99 said the voice of the footman. â\\x80\\x98 What a great bother,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith. â\\x80\\x98 I wanted so to go on talking.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I dare say I shanâ\\x80\\x99t be long,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh, â\\x80\\x98 and then Iâ\\x80\\x99ll come back straight to you. I canâ\\x80\\x99t think what anyone can want with me here. I know so few people at Folkestone.â\\x80\\x99 She got up as she spoke, and went to the door. â\\x80\\x98 Who is it, Thomas ? Do you know ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If you please, maâ\\x80\\x99am,â\\x80\\x99 answered Thomas, â\\x80\\x98 itâ\\x80\\x99s a woman who says she has found Miss Edithâ\\x80\\x99s canary.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Leigh turned quickly round to see if Edith was near. â\\x80\\x98 Edith, darling !â\\x80\\x99 she said joyfully, â\\x80\\x98 do you hear that ? Do you hear what Thomas is saying ?â\\x80\\x99 There was no doubt about Edith having heard. She was standing in the doorway, her eyes sparkling, her cheeks on fire. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, mamma !â\\x80\\x99 she said, as soon as she could speak, â\\x80\\x98 do you think it is really true ? Has she really found Dicky, my own little Dicky ? and do you think he is in her hand ? Thomas, had she got him with her ? Tell me, quick.â\\x80\\x99 But Thomas was gone downstairs again. â\\x80\\x98 Well, I will go and see,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh ; â\\x80\\x98you wait for me here. I will come back directly, and most likely bring Dicky with me. The woman is sure to have brought him. Of course she would not leave him behind.â\\x80\\x99 8â\\x80\\x942116 THE TOWN-CRIER; OR, Edith came to the top of the stairs and watched her mamma go downstairs and cross the hall, and go into the drawing-room, and then she flew down the passage to the bed-room nursery, and burst into the room. â\\x80\\x98Nurse! Margaret!â\\x80\\x99 she said as she rushed in, â\\x80\\x98heâ\\x80\\x99s round ! Dickyâ\\x80\\x99s found !â\\x80\\x99 Nursewasas delighted as Edith could havewished her to be, and Margaret so pleased that she readily agreed to Edithâ\\x80\\x99s request that she would come and dance for joy with her in the day-nursery. And for about tenminutesshe danced Edith round and round,till they were both quite giddy and tired. Then, as Mrs. Leigh had not come back, they set to work to fill up the time by getting Dickyâ\\x80\\x99s cage ready for him. They put seed and sand and water, and a great lump of sugar, and hung up the cage in its old place by the window. â\\x80\\x98 Only think, Margaret,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith, as she stood watching the cage gently swinging backwards and forwards, â\\x80\\x98 only think that to-night, this very night, Dicky will be there as usual, perching on my finger, and eating out of my hand, and giving me the sweetest of kisses through the bars.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I hope he wonâ\\x80\\x99t have forgotten his pretty tricks,â\\x80\\x99 said Margaret. â\\x80\\x98 I wonder where heâ\\x80\\x99s been all this time.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes, I wonder,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith ; â\\x80\\x98 letâ\\x80\\x99s try and guess. It will make the time seem less long while weâ\\x80\\x99re waiting for mamma to come back.â\\x80\\x99A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. So they both began guessing, and most extra 172 ordinary guesses they made, of every kind and sort. But neither of them ever went the least near the truth ; neither of them ever dreamt that Dicky had been shut up for ten days in a little girlâ\\x80\\x99s sick-room. â\\x80\\x98 I canâ\\x80\\x99t think why he was not sent back sooner,â\\x80\\x99 said Margaret. â\\x80\\x98 No, no more can I,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith. â\\x80\\x98 But never mind, Margaret ; lieâ\\x80\\x99s come back now, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m so glad I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do. Come and dance for joy again.â\\x80\\x99 So the dance was danced all over again; and then another visit was made to the bird-cage, to make quite sure everything was there that Dicky could possibly want, and the water was changed because they fancied there was a speck of dust in it. When all this was done, Edith rather\\' began to wonder why her mamma was so long coming. So she stationed herself on the landing to watch. Then she got tired of that and went back into the nursery, and waited and waited. Half an hour passed by, and still her mamma did not return. CHAPTER X. Meanwhile, Mrs. Leigh had hurried downstairs and gone into the room where poor Mrs. Brown was so tremblingly awaiting her.118 THE TO WN-CRIERj OR, â\\x80\\x98 Well, my good woman,â\\x80\\x99 she said, with a pleasant smile, as she shut the door behind her, â\\x80\\x98 and so you have brought us news of my little girlâ\\x80\\x99s lost canary. But â\\x80\\x99 She stopped short, as she looked in vain for the bird. â\\x80\\x98 I have not brought him, maâ\\x80\\x99am,â\\x80\\x99 interrupted poor Mrs. Brown, nervously, â\\x80\\x98 but heâ\\x80\\x99s safe and well, and I will bring him the first thing to-morrow, that is, if you will be good enough to wait so long.â\\x80\\x99 She looked imploringly at Mrs. Leigh as she spoke. She saw at a glance that she was a kind lady, but she was a little frightened to see her evident surprise. Mrs. Leigh certainly was surprised. â\\x80\\x98 She knows nothing about me, and she thinks I donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to bring him back,â\\x80\\x99 thought Mrs. Brown to herself. â\\x80\\x98 She thinks Iâ\\x80\\x99m dishonest, and no wonder.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How was it you did not bring him with you ?â\\x80\\x99 inquired Mrs. Leigh, rather gravely. â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s a long story, and a sad one,â\\x80\\x99 faltered Mrs. Brown ; â\\x80\\x98 will you let me tell it to you first, before you judge too hardly of me ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Surely,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh, gently, touched to see the evident distress under which Mrs. Brown was labouring. â\\x80\\x98 Sit down, my good woman, and tell me how you came to find the bird, and all about it.â\\x80\\x99 Reassured by her kindness, Mrs. Brown took courage and related her history from the day on which she had first found Dicky eating groundsel in her cart till the present moment.A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 119 She told of the use Dicky had been to her during Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s illness, of the wonderful way in which God had used him to keep up her faith and courage, of the sick childâ\\x80\\x99s love for the bird, and of the struggle it had been to have to tell her she must part with her little playmate. â\\x80\\x98 The child was too ill to understand it was wrong to keep what did not belong to her,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Brown, earnestly, â\\x80\\x98 and I dared not excite her by insisting on taking it away. You, maâ\\x80\\x99am, who have a little girl of your own, will feel for me, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure. But to-morrow. . .â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Do not fear,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh, and the tears were standing in her eyes, so touched was she by the story ; 1 your little girl shall keep the bird to-night, and to-morrow too, and for as many days as she likes. It would indeed be a bad return on our part, if we repaid all the care you have taken of Dicky by snatching him away from poor little Nancy be 172 fore she had got quite well.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 God bless you, maâ\\x80\\x99am,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Brown, warmly; â\\x80\\x98 God bless you, and reward you for your kindness. But Nancy will be well enough in a day or two, I hope, to understand that Dicky must go to his owners, for sheâ\\x80\\x99s a good little girl, maâ\\x80\\x99am, though I say it that shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t, only illness has upset her like, for the time.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 We must feed her up, and sheâ\\x80\\x99ll soon get strong. And that reminds me,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh, smiling, â\\x80\\x98 that I have not yet given the â\\x80\\x9c five shillings re 172 ward â\\x80\\x9d that the Folkestone people must be so tired120 THE TOWN-CRIER; OR, of hearing promised to the finder of the little canary/ She put her hand in her purse, and handed Mrs. Brown half a sovereign. â\\x80\\x98 I have no change maâ\\x80\\x99am,â\\x80\\x99 said the poor woman. â\\x80\\x98I do not want any,â\\x80\\x99smiled Mrs. Leigh. â\\x80\\x98Five shillings reward for finding him, and five shillings for all the expense Dicky has been to you these ten days.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Bless his heart,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Brown, 1 it isnâ\\x80\\x99t much he\\'s cost me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Groundsel without end,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh, count 172 ing, as she spoke, each article on her fingers, â\\x80\\x98 a little sand, a little seed, a great deal of care, and houseroom, besides the love he has met with. But we canâ\\x80\\x99t pay for that, Mrs. Brown, can we ?â\\x80\\x99 She did not wait for an answer, but she rang the bell, saying : â\\x80\\x98I am going to send Nancy a little soup, and some jelly. It will be too late for you to make beef-tea by the time you get home, and to-morrow morning I will come and see her, and bring Dicky a lot of sand and seed, for he really must not be an expense to you any longer.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 God bless you, maâ\\x80\\x99am,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Brown again ; â\\x80\\x98 you are the kindest lady I ever met.â\\x80\\x99 The footman answered the bell, the orders were given, and very soon Mrs. Brown was laden with soup, jelly, and all sorts of good things for Nancy. â\\x80\\x98 I can never thank you as I ought, maâ\\x80\\x99am,â\\x80\\x99 she said, as she rose to depart.A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 121 â\\x80\\x98 It is I who ought to thank you, I think,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh. â\\x80\\x98 / have only paid a debt that I owed, but you have left your sick child, and come all this way in the wet, that I should not be another night in ignorance of the birdâ\\x80\\x99s safety, and I do thank you very much indeed.â\\x80\\x99 So saying, she rose and opened the door. Mrs. Brown, with a heart too full to speak, passed out of the room, curtseying low, and Mrs. Leigh took her way to the nursery. As she went upstairs, with her mind full of the story she had just been hearing from Mrs. Brown, something rushed down from the landing above, and threw itself upon her. Mrs. Leigh quite started, and nearly overbalanced herself. â\\x80\\x98 My dear child,â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, when she saw who it was, 1 how you frightened me !â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 At last !â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Edith. â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! mamma, what a time you have been. Where is he ? Where is he? Give him to me, quick. I expected to see him in your hand.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been hearing a very sad story, Edie,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh, gently. Her thoughts were dwelling on little Nancy, and her poor patient mother, and all the sufferings they had had to undergo. For the moment she had almost forgotten about Edith and the canary-bird, and hardly heard what the child was saying. â\\x80\\x98Yes, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith, impatiently; â\\x80\\x98but what about Dicky ?â\\x80\\x99122 THE TO WN-CRIER; OR, â\\x80\\x98He is safe and well,â\\x80\\x99 answered Mrs. Leigh, â\\x80\\x98 but . . â\\x80\\x98Yes, but where is he?â\\x80\\x99 repeated Edith. â\\x80\\x98Did the woman bring him ? What has she done with him ? Please tell me quick !â\\x80\\x99 And Edith fidgeted from one foot to the other with impatience as she spoke. Mrs. Leigh looked at her for a moment without answering. I fancy she was thinking how very selfish children can be sometimes, and how much taken up with their own concerns and pleasures ; how apt to think what affects them is so very much more important than what affects other people, for she looked grave, even sad. And I fancy also that many a mother must think this, when her mind is full of things her children know nothing about, sad thoughts perhaps, and troubles the children cannot share, and her little boys or girls go on begging her to read to them, or play with them, or tell them a story. I dare say each of you can remember seeing your mamma look grave, and as if she were thinking of something else, when you have gone to her and asked her to do something for your amusement, and I hope, if you are a kind and unselfish little boy or girl, you have always, at such times, left off bothering her directly, and gone and occupied yourself your own way, saying to yourself, â\\x80\\x98 Mamma cannot attend to me now ; she has got something else to think ofdA LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 123 Well, Edith, I am sorry to say, though she noticed her mamma looked grave, did not leave off bother 172 ing; she thought nothing could be so important as her concerns. â\\x80\\x98Mamma!â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98mamma! why donâ\\x80\\x99t you answer ? Why donâ\\x80\\x99t you tell me ? Why do you look so grave ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to tell you the story, Edith,â\\x80\\x99 her mamma answered at last, â\\x80\\x98 and then you will know why I look so grave.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, but tell me first about Dicky, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith. â\\x80\\x98 He is safe and well, as I told you before,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh, â\\x80\\x98 but you cannot have him to-night.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, mamma! mamma!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Edith,almost crying with disappointment ; â\\x80\\x98 why not V â\\x80\\x98That is just what I am going to tell you,â\\x80\\x99 answered her mother. â\\x80\\x98 Come into my room while I dress for dinner.â\\x80\\x99 Edith followed, but with such a pouting lip and such a discontented expression, that her mamma said very gravely : â\\x80\\x98A little while ago, you would have been too thankful only to hear Dicky was alive. What was it you said to me up in the nursery, only half-an- hour ago ? Do you remember ?â\\x80\\x99 Edith hung her head, and said something about having forgotten. â\\x80\\x98 If you do not remember, / do,â\\x80\\x99 resumed Mrs. Leigh. â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c If I could only know,â\\x80\\x9d you said, â\\x80\\x9c that he was safe and happy, I think I could quite make124 THE TOIVN-CRIER; OR, up my mind never to see him again. But it is so dreadful thinking of all the things that may have happened to him.â\\x80\\x9d Those are your own words, Edith. And yet now, when I tell you that he is safe and well, and that none of those dreadful things have happened to him, you look cross and grumble just because you cannot have him back to-night.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The cage is all ready and the sugar and all,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith, beginning to cry. â\\x80\\x98 I see I must begin my story at once,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh. And she did so, and told Edith the sad story which you children know so well. But to her great surprise, when she had finished, Edithâ\\x80\\x99s face still wore the same discontented ex 172 pression. â\\x80\\x98 I want Dicky quite as much as Nancy,â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98 and itâ\\x80\\x99s my bird.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Leigh looked very grave at this. She got up, and put Edith off her lap. â\\x80\\x98 Very well,â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98 you shall have your bird back. Not to-night, but the first thing to-morrow. I thought, of course, after hearing about the poor little sick girl, you would immediately have said Nancy might keep it till she was quite well, par 172 ticularly as, if it had not been for Mrs. Brown, Dicky would probably have died some time ago. But since it does not seem you have any intention of the kind, we will go to the cottage directly after breakfast to-morrow, and fetch away the bird. But, remember, on one condition.â\\x80\\x99A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 125 â\\x80\\x98 What is it, mamma ?â\\x80\\x99 said Edith, uneasily. â\\x80\\x98 That I will tell you to-morrow,â\\x80\\x99 answered Mrs. Leigh ; â\\x80\\x98 now run away to bed.â\\x80\\x99 She kissed her so gravely that Edith felt very uncomfortable. â\\x80\\x98 Mamma,â\\x80\\x99 she said, trying to hide her face on her mammaâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder, â\\x80\\x98 you donâ\\x80\\x99t kiss me so nicely as usual. You look so grave. Are you angry with me, mamma ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I am not angry,â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Leigh answered, â\\x80\\x98 only disappointed to find I have such a selfish, hard 172 hearted little girl. However, we wonâ\\x80\\x99t talk about it any more to-night. There is the gong. I must go down.â\\x80\\x99 She disengaged herself from Edith, without kiss 172 ing her again, and went down to dinner, and Edith went to the nursery thoroughly unhappy, and not feeling at all as you would expect a little girl to feel who had found her long-lost and much-loved canary-bird. CHAPTER XI. Editii woke the next morning with a feeling that something very delightful had happened, and also something very disagreeable. Very soon she remembered that Dicky was found, and directly after came the recollection of her mammaâ\\x80\\x99s displeasure, and of her grave manner126 THE T0 WN- CRIER ; OR, when she said, \\' We will fetch him backâ\\x80\\x94but on one condition.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What can the condition be ?â\\x80\\x99 Edith said to her 172 self over and over again while she was being dressed. She knew very well what â\\x80\\x98 on condition â\\x80\\x99 meant, for her mamma very often said such things as â\\x80\\x98 You may play in the sun on condition that you put on your shady hat or, â\\x80\\x98 You may go on the grass on â\\x80¢ condition that you change your boots directly you get home.â\\x80\\x99 Once she had said to her almost the very same words as last night. â\\x80\\x98 You may sit up to late dinner to-night, but on one condition.â\\x80\\x99 And that condition had turned out to be that she was to go to bed half an hour earlier the next night. So Edith knew that there would be something to be done that she would not particularly like before she got back her bird, but what it could be she could not imagine. *â\\x80\\x9c A message was sent up to the nursery that Miss Edith was to come down with her walking things on, as she was going out with her mamma directly after breakfast, and that Dickyâ\\x80\\x99s cage, and a parcel of sand, and another of seed, were to be brought down with her. Edith was much excited by all these arrange 172 ments, and danced downstairs in great delight. But her pleasure was damped when she entered the dining-room and saw that her mamma was looking just as grave as she had done the evening before.A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 127 However, Mrs. Leigh said nothing, except to tell Edith to ask the footman to put all the parcels on the back seat of the fly which was waiting at the door. Edith ran off to give the message, and when she returned found her mamma had gone up to put on her things. As soon as Mrs. Leigh reappeared, Edith went shyly up to her and whispered, â\\x80\\x98 Will you tell me the condition now, mamma ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I will tell you as we go along,â\\x80\\x99 was the answer. â\\x80\\x98 Now jump into the fly.â\\x80\\x99 So Edith had to wait some time longer for her curiosity to be gratified. As they drove along she tried to make herself feel happy by constantly saying, in a whisper : â\\x80\\x98 We are on our way to see Dicky : to fetch Dicky home.â\\x80\\x99 But somehow or other, while her mamma looked so grave and did not talk, all the pleasure seemed to be taken out of it. â\\x80\\x98 Mamma,â\\x80\\x99 she said at last, rather timidly, â\\x80\\x98shan\\'t you be very glad to see Dicky again ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, dear,â\\x80\\x99 said her mamma, â\\x80\\x98very glad.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 So shall I,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith. They drove on a good way farther, and then Edith began again. â\\x80\\x98 Mamma ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes, dear.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Will you tell me the condition now ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, Edith, I will. The condition is that you yourself shall tell the little sick girl that you have come to take away the bird from her.â\\x80\\x99128 THE TO WN-CRIERj OR, â\\x80\\x98 Oh, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith, blushing crimson. â\\x80\\x98 Why ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Because I cannot. I would not do anything so unk-ind for the world. If it is to be done at all, you must do it yourself. Now jump out, for the fly will not be able to go any further than this, as the lane is so narrow.â\\x80\\x99 Edithâ\\x80\\x99s face was very long as she got out of the fly, and followed her mother slowly and gravely up the little path that led to Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s home. Old Mrs. King was standing at the door. â\\x80\\x98 Can we see Mrs. Brown ?â\\x80\\x99 asked Mrs. Leigh of the old woman. â\\x80\\x98 Sheâ\\x80\\x99s up with the little girl, maâ\\x80\\x99am. Will you walk in while I go and tell her sheâ\\x80\\x99s wanted ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Please donâ\\x80\\x99t call her away from the child,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh ; â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go up. Come, Edith.â\\x80\\x99 She mounted the rickety little staircase, and Edith unwillingly followed. When they got to the top she turned round and held up her finger, for through the open door she could see Nancy lying in bed, and she fancied she might be asleep. She signed to Edith to come where she could see in, and whispered to her to be very quiet. Fancy Edithâ\\x80\\x99s surprise when she recognised in the sick child the little girl with the sorrowful eyes that she had taken such a fancy to more than a fortnight ago, and for whom she had so often looked in vain in all the streets of Folkestone. â\\x80\\x98 Mamma !â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, in an excited whisper, â\\x80\\x98 itâ\\x80\\x99s her ! Itâ\\x80\\x99s the little girl !â\\x80\\x99A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. â\\x80\\x98 Hush,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Leigh, for Nancy was moving a little, and she was afraid Edithâ\\x80\\x99s talking might wake her. Edith put her hand in her mammaâ\\x80\\x99s and kept very still. Presently a weak little voice said, â\\x80\\x98 Mammy, are you there ?â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Brown advanced to the bedside, but her back was turned to the door, so she did not see Mrs. Leigh and Edith. â\\x80\\x98 Awake at last, dearie ? why you have had a long sleep. Itâ\\x80\\x99s getting on for ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock; youâ\\x80\\x99ll be all the better for it, I\\'m sure.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Come here, mammy dear, I want to speak to you ; Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got something I want to say.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What is it, my little Nannie ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been awake some time, mammy, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been thinking, and now Iâ\\x80\\x99ve quite made up my mind as to what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been thinking about.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And what is it youâ\\x80\\x99ve been thinking about, mj dearie ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Mammy,â\\x80\\x99 said the faint voice, and so faint i was that Mrs. Leigh and Edith could only just catch what it said ; â\\x80\\x98 I was selfish and naughty last night, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m quite good to-day. You shall take Dicky back to his rich friends, and I wonâ\\x80\\x99t say a word, or cry the very least, only Iâ\\x80\\x99d rather have him go soon, before Iâ\\x80\\x99ve time to think about it much.â\\x80\\x99 * Ah! thatâ\\x80\\x99s my own good little Nancy,â\\x80\\x99 said the joyful voice of Mrs. Brown. â\\x80\\x98I knew youâ\\x80\\x99d be willing to let him go to-day, and so I told the lady.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Lady, what lady, mammy 9130 THE TO WN- CRIER; OR, â\\x80\\x98You were asleep last night, dearie, and so you never knew that I left you and went to Bouverie Square to see the lady whom Dicky belongs to. It was she who sent you the nice beef-tea I gave you in the middle of the night, and which has made you sleep so well. I went to tell her Dicky was safe and well, for you know sheâ\\x80\\x99s been searching for him this fortnight and more. She and her little girl, she told me, were getting afraid they would never see him again.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Little girl, mammy ? Does Dicky belong to a little girl like me ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Just about your age, I should fancy, judging from the hat I saw lying on the sofa.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, poor little girl!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Nancy,â\\x80\\x98how unhappy she must have been without him all this time. How naughty I was to keep him away from her last night. Oh, take him back to her, quick, dear mammy, and tell her how sorry I am.â\\x80\\x99 It was just at this moment that Mrs. Leigh turned round and looked at Edith. She did not say a word, and yet Edithâ\\x80\\x99s face flushed crimson, and the tears rushed into her eyes. For that look seemed to say, â\\x80\\x98You were not sorry for Nancy, but Nancy is sorry for you. You, when you heard her story, said â\\x80\\x9c I want Dicky quite as much as Nancy does, and itâ\\x80\\x99s my bird.â\\x80\\x9d She, now she hears your story, says, â\\x80\\x9c Oh, poor little girl . . . take him back to her quickly, and tell her how sorry I am.â\\x80\\x9d You only thought of yourself. She pnly thinks of you.â\\x80\\x99A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. Edith could have run away for shame, and hidden herself from the very sound of Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s feeble voice, but her hand was in her mammaâ\\x80\\x99s, and she was obliged to keep still. â\\x80\\x98 Bring Dicky to me, mammy ; let me give him one more kiss before he goes.â\\x80\\x99 The sound of kissing followed, and then came Dickyâ\\x80\\x99s well-known â\\x80\\x98 sw-eet ! sw-eet !â\\x80\\x99 Edith started as her little favouriteâ\\x80\\x99s voice fell upon her ear ; she raised her head for a minute, and looked and listened eagerly. But it soon went down again, as she witnessed the sick childâ\\x80\\x99s sorrow, and heard her sad words of farewell. â\\x80\\x98Good-bye, Dicky,â\\x80\\x99 said poor little Nancy, and Edith knew she was crying, by the tone. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve loved you very much, and weâ\\x80\\x99ve been very happy together, but you donâ\\x80\\x99t belong to me, Dicky, and so I must let you go.â\\x80\\x99 Then came a sound of sobbing ; outside the door was a sound of sobbing too. Mrs. Leigh felt the hand that was in hers sud 172 denly and violently wrenched away. She turned to see what was the matter with Edith, and found her gone ! Edith was in the room, on the bed ! with Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s thin hand in both of hers, and her tears flowing as fast. â\\x80\\x98No ! no !â\\x80\\x99 she was saying, â\\x80\\x98 donâ\\x80\\x99t say good-bye to him ; he shanâ\\x80\\x99t go away, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t take him from you, You shall keep him as long as ever you like 9â\\x80\\x943132 THE TOWN-CRIER; OR, only please stop crying ; I canâ\\x80\\x99t bear to hear you cry.â\\x80\\x99 It all happened so quickly, and Mrs. Leigh was so taken by surprise, that Edith had finished speak 172 ing before her mother had sufficiently recovered her astonishment to follow her into the room. When she got there, she found Edith wiping away Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s tears with her own pocket-handkerchief, and Mrs. Brown crying for joy by the bedside. And Dicky ! You never saw a bird in such a state of delight as he was at the sight of his own little mistress, whom he knew again in a moment. He chirruped, he fluttered, he struggled to get at her. But Edith was so occupied with Nancy that she actually had almost forgotten Dicky altogether, and I cannot tell you how pleased Mrs. Leigh was to see her little girl had so far overcome her selfish 172 ness as to be able thus entirely to forget herself while rejoicing in the happiness of others. Dicky, however, grew so clamorous that Mrs. Leigh took pity on the little bird and opened his cage-door, to allow him to get to his little mistress. Out he flew, and perched upon her shoulder ; and Edith, with a cry of delight, turned round and covered him with kisses. It was pretty to see the childâ\\x80\\x99s delight at meet 172 ing her little favourite, and the birdâ\\x80\\x99s delight at meeting her. Nancy, with her pale face bright with pleasure, lay back on her pillow, and watched them with a smile.A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 133 There were so many little tricks of Dickyâ\\x80\\x99s that Nancy had had no idea of, and it pleased her to see Edith make him do them all. Very soon, Mrs. Brown was despatched to fetch all the parcels from the carriage, and Edith put Dicky into his own cage, and gave him sand and seed and a lump of sugar ; and the two little girls became great friends over all this, and chatted together as if they had known each other all their lives. Edith reminded Nancy of the day when she had first seen her, and was delighted to find Nancy remem 172 bered it too. In fact, she enjoyed the half-hour in the cottage so much, that she was quite unwilling to come away. But Mrs. Leigh was afraid Nancy would be tired, so she would not let Edith stay any longer ; but she promised her she should return to-morrow, and pay Dicky another visit. â\\x80\\x98And every day, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 entreated Edith ; * every day till Nancy is quite well.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Leigh readily gave permission, and Edith left the cottage with a far lighter heart than when she had entered it. â\\x80\\x98 I feel so happy, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 she said, as she seated herself in the fly by her motherâ\\x80\\x99s side. She slipped her hand into her mammaâ\\x80\\x99s as she spoke, and knew by its fond pressure that she was pleased with her, and that the cloud that had arisen between them had quite passed away. â\\x80\\x98 Well, Miss Edith,â\\x80\\x99said nurse and Margaret to-134 THE TO WN-CRIER; OR, gether, as she entered the nursery, â\\x80\\x98 and whereâ\\x80\\x99s Dicky ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I have not brought him,â\\x80\\x99 answered Edith, â\\x80\\x98 but Iâ\\x80\\x99m much happier than if I had. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve left him to Nancy, who wants him much more than me.â\\x80\\x99 That evening her mother spoke to her of the evil of selfishness, and pointed out to her how heedless it makes us of the happiness of others, and to what bad feelings it may lead. â\\x80\\x98 Why, it made my little girl almost cruel to-day,â\\x80\\x99 she said. But Edith was as penitent as her mother could possibly desire, and Mrs. Leigh saw it was not necessary to say much. Edith had had a lesson that day which she would not easily forget, and one that her mother hoped would make a deep impression upon her. In order, however, to see how far the effect would last, Mrs. Leigh determined in her own mind to leave entirely to Edith how long Nancy was to keep the canary. Accordingly, she never said anything about it. She took Edith to the cottage the next day, and the day after, and the day after that. â\\x80\\x98Nancy is getting much better,â\\x80\\x99 she said, on the fourth day ; â\\x80\\x98 she will soon be quite well.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m so glad, mamma, ainâ\\x80\\x99t you ?â\\x80\\x99 But she said nothing about the bird. It went on like this for ten days or more, till at last Mrs. Leigh really began to think Edith in-A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 135 tended Dicky to remain with Nancy till they left Folkestone. The fact was, Edith had grown very fond of Nancy. Her daily visit to the sick child had become a source of great interest to her. She had taken to her, as you may remember, the very first day she had seen her looking mournfully at her with her â\\x80\\x98 sorrowful eyes and now that she had come to know her better, she was more than ever attracted to her. Nancy was so good, so gentle, and so patient that no one could know her without loving her. Edith took pleasure in lending her her books, her pictures, and her toys, and was always planning something or other for Nancyâ\\x80\\x99s amusement. The day was now rapidly approaching when Edith was to leave Folkestone and to return to Homeleigh, and her joy at the prospect of return 172 ing to all her pets and pastimes was very much damped by the thought that she would have to say good-bye to Nancy for ever. There was something else, too, which she was turning over in her mind, which made her feel very sad, so that, altogether, she often looked grave and thoughtful as the time wore on. Her mamma of course observed this, and at last, one evening, she spoke to her about it, and asked her what was the matter. Edith answered that the prospect of leaving Nancy made her sorrowful, for one thing, she added, half to herself.THE TO WN-CRIER; OR, â\\x80\\x98And you canâ\\x80\\x99t tell me the other thing ?â\\x80\\x99 said her mamma. â\\x80\\x98Yes, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll try, only Iâ\\x80\\x99m so afraid I shall cry when I tell you. It is that I know Nancy will be so lonely without Dicky, and so â\\x80\\x99 Her lips quivered, and the tears came into her eyes. â\\x80\\x98 So what, darling ?â\\x80\\x99 said her mother, gently. â\\x80\\x98 So Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been trying all these days to make up my mind to do something, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith, raising her eyes, streaming with tears, to her motherâ\\x80\\x99s face, â\\x80\\x98 and itâ\\x80\\x99s only to-day that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve quite, quite made up my mind to do it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What is it, my darling ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98To give Dicky to Nancy altogether,â\\x80\\x99 said Edith, bursting into tears, and hiding her face on her motherâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder. â\\x80\\x98 I canâ\\x80\\x99t help crying about it, mamma, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve quite made up my mind to do it, all the same.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 My dear little girl,â\\x80\\x99 said her mamma, taking her into her lap, and kissing her, â\\x80\\x98 I cannot tell you how pleased I am that you should, of your own accord, propose to do so kind an action ; but it is not necessary, darling, for you to make such a self-sacrifice. For some time past, Mrs. Brown and I have been concocting a little plan together by means of which neither you, nor Nancy, nor Dicky need be separated from one another at all. I have never said anything to you about it, because I was not sure till to-day whether it could beA LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. I37 managed or not ; but now it is all quite settled, and nothing remains to be done but for me to tell you what it is.â\\x80\\x99 1 Oh, mamma !â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Edith, â\\x80\\x98 what can it be?â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Leigh then told her that there was a small cottage at Iiomeleigh which was at that moment vacant, and that she had proposed to Mrs. Browne to leave Folkestone, and to come and settle in that cottage. There was a little garden attached to it, and the idea was that Mrs. Brown should grow vegetables, and keep cocks and hens, and make her money by selling them at the market. Mrs. Brown had joyfully consented, feeling sure she could earn her livelihood far better so, than trudging about with her barrow in Folkestone. Nancy was to go to the village school, and when she grew older, to go out to service, or perhaps, who knows, become one of the servants at Home- leigh. â\\x80\\x98And Dicky,â\\x80\\x99 finished Mrs. Leigh, with a smile, â\\x80\\x98can either live with Nancy, and you can go to her to see him, or else he can live at Homeleigh, and Nancy can come to see you.â\\x80\\x99 I need not tell you of Edithâ\\x80\\x99s joy, nor of that of Nancy, who had not been told of the arrangement, on purpose that Edith might have the pleasure of announcing it to her. All I need tell you is that no one said a word against the plan ; and so it came to pass, that when138 THE TO IVN- CRIER ; OR, Mr. and Mrs. Leigh and Edith left Folkestone and returned to Homeleigh, Nancy and her mother went too ! All this happened several years ago. Edith is now a tall young lady in the schoolroom, who takes her walks with her governess, and learns a great many lessons. Nancy is a tall girl too, and has left the village school, and is learning dressmaking, to fit herself for being Edithâ\\x80\\x99s maid. Dicky is getting very old and lazy, and his voice is cracked, and he sits huddled up on his perch most of the day. You would hardly know any of the people in the story again : those few years have changed them so much. The town-crier is the one who has altered least. He walks up and down the town still, and his voice is as strong as ever. Any day that you go to Folkestone you may see him with his bell in his hand and a crowd of boj\\'s round him. And any day you may chance to hear him cry : â\\x80\\x98 Lost ! On the Beach, A Geneva Watch and Chain ! Whoever will bring it To â\\x80\\x94 Bouverie Square, Will receive One Pound Reward ! ! ! God save the Queen !\\'A LESSON OF UNSELFISHNESS. 139 But if you ask him about Edith and Nancy and the canary, I am afraid he will shake his head and say he knows nothing about them. For they are imaginary people, and Dicky is an imaginary bird, and the only real person in the story is The Town-crier.the CHILDREN WITH THE INDIAN-RUBBER BALL OR, A LESSON OF OBEDIENCE.CHAPTER I. It was on a lovely evening towards the end of August that some children were playing together in one of the squares at Brighton. The square was very full, and there were many other groups of children scattered about in different parts ; some play 172 ing at croquet, others at â\\x80\\x98Tom Tiddlerâ\\x80\\x99s ground,â\\x80\\x99 and others at the popular square-game, â\\x80\\x98 Flags.â\\x80\\x99 But the group first mentioned had a big indian- rubber ball which they were throwing from one to the other. It was a very large ball indeed, almost as much as the youngest of them, a little boy of five, could hold. His brother and sister, who looked about seven and nine years old respectively, were very kind to the little fellow, and often pre 172 tended to let it slip out of their hands that he might have a chance of catching it sometimes. Their governess was sitting under a tree reading, for the children played so happily together that she could enjoy her book without interruption. This was not the case all over the square, I am sorry to say. Among some of the groups a quarrel arose every now and then ; and an appeal to a144 THE CHILDREN WITH THE mother, or nurse, or governess, had to be made before the game could be resumed. From the croquet-players came such expressions as : â\\x80\\x98 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not fair ! you pushed.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s not through the hoop!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, it is/ â\\x80\\x98You neednâ\\x80\\x99t have sent me quite so far !â\\x80\\x99 etc., etc. And from the other game, such shouts as : â\\x80\\x98 I touched you, and you pulled your frock out of my hand !â\\x80\\x99 or, â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99re caught!â\\x80\\x99 or, â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99re not released, because you werenâ\\x80\\x99t standing in the right place ; itâ\\x80\\x99s not fair !â\\x80\\x99 But the group of fair-haired children never quarrelled, though they laughed and shouted quite as much as the rest. In the middle of their game, the square-gate nearest to them opened, and a lady and gentleman and two little girls came in. They did not seem to know any of the people in the square, for they stood watching the games for a few minutes, and then walked along the gravel path. The youngest walked between her father and mother, talking quietly to them ; but the eldest fell back, and cast a longing glance at all the happy groups playing about on the grass. She was par 172 ticularly attracted by the three fair-haired children with the indian-rubber bal!, and stood watching them with eager eyes as they kicked it about and made it bound in the air. She was about eight years old, and had bright eyes and dark hair. Restless eyes they wereâ\\x80\\x94eyes that took in every 172 thing at a glance, and were all over the square in a moment. She stood still for a few minutes, and then ran after her father and mother.INDIAN-RVBBER BALL. 145 â\\x80\\x98 Mamma,â\\x80\\x99 she called out, â\\x80\\x98 please stop a moment, I want to speak to you.â\\x80\\x99 Mr. and Mrs. Fielding turned round, and waited until she came up. * Mamma,â\\x80\\x99 she said, eagerly, â\\x80\\x98 may I ask those little children to let me play with them ? ; â\\x80\\x98 My dear child,â\\x80\\x99 answered her mother, â\\x80\\x98 you know very well that I never let you play with children that I do not know.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 persisted Alice, â\\x80\\x98 they are such very nice little children ; and I am sure you would like to know them.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I have no doubt, dear,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Fielding, â\\x80\\x98 that they are very nice children ; but then, you see, I do not know who they are.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But I will ask them, if you like,â\\x80\\x99 said Alice, eagerly. â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t the least mind asking them their names.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I dare say not,â\\x80\\x99 said her father, laughing ; â\\x80\\x98 but I think they would consider you a very rude little girl. And what would their governess say, I wonder, to a strange child running up to them and saying, â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s your name?â\\x80\\x9d Noâ\\x80\\x94no, Alice, I could not think of letting you do such a thing. Come along, and walk with us.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It is so dull, walking along the path,â\\x80\\x99 grumbled Alice, â\\x80\\x98 and that is the jolliest game of all/ â\\x80\\x98Constance does not find it dull,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Field 172 ing ; â\\x80\\x98 she is quite happy walking with us-â\\x80\\x94are you not, Constance ?â\\x80\\x99 and, taking his youngest daughterâ\\x80\\x99s hand as he spoke, they all walked on. 10146 THE CHILDREN WITH THE â\\x80\\x98 It is rather dull for them without any com 172 panions,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Fielding to her husband, â\\x80\\x98 and rather hard to see all these games going on, without joining in them ; but I suppose the Conynghams will call in a day or two.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, I should think so,â\\x80\\x99 he answered ; â\\x80\\x98and their children must be about the age of ours.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What did you say, mamma?â\\x80\\x99 asked Constance, â\\x80\\x98 what children ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Your Aunt Mary has some friends here,â\\x80\\x99 an 172 swered Mrs. Fielding ; â\\x80\\x98 and she said she would write and tell them we were coming. So I dare say you will have some companions soon.â\\x80\\x99 Alice had remained behind, and had not heard this conversation, but on Constance turning round and saying her mamma had got something to tell her, she came running up. â\\x80\\x98 I was saying you would have some playfellows soon,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Fielding ; and she repeated what she had just told Constance about the little Conynghams. But Alice was in a discontented frame of mind, and she would not see any comfort in the prospect. She was quite sure she should not like the little Conynghams ; she would rather not know them. She only wanted to know the fair-haired children, and if she might not play with them, she should rather play by herself. â\\x80\\x98 Very well,â\\x80\\x99 said her mother, â\\x80\\x98 you neednâ\\x80\\x99t play with the poor little Conynghams unless you like ; but I think you are in a great hurry to say you willINDIA N-RÃ\\x9cBBÃ\\x88R BALL. Ã\\x8d47 not like them. You had better wait until you know them.â\\x80\\x99 But Alice was quite sure she should never care for them. They would be covered with freckles, she knew, and have dark hair, and, in fact, be as unlike the fair-haired children as possible. â\\x80\\x98Papa,â\\x80\\x99 she entreated, â\\x80\\x98do just come and see them playing ; I am sure you will like them. And wonâ\\x80\\x99t you come, mamma ?â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Fielding was tired, so she sat down on a seat with Constance, and Alice and her father walked off together. The indian-rubber ball game was still going on, and Mr. Fielding acknowledged that it was a very merry game, and that they were very dear little children ; but still he was not, as Alice had secretly hoped, so much overcome by their appearance as to give her leave to play with them. She kept him there as long as she could, hoping to the last he would suddenly relent ; but after awhile he said it was time to be going, and very unwillingly Alice was carried off to join her mother and sister. They met them coming along the path, and Mrs. Fielding said they must be going home. Her husband unlocked the square-gate, and held it open for them to pass through. Alice was the last to go out, and even then was looking longingly back to the children by whom she had been so much attracted. Their house was nearly opposite the gate, and 10â\\x80\\x942148 THE CHILDREN WITH THE they had only just to walk across the road and open the door, for doors are seldom kept locked at Brighton. On the hall-table were some cards and a note, and Mrs. Fielding read out loud the names Mr. and Mrs. Conyngham. â\\x80\\x98 There, children,â\\x80\\x99 she said, 1 you have not had to wait long,â\\x80\\x99 and she added, as she opened and read the note, \\'Mrs. Conyngham asks me to bring one of my little girls to-morrow to make acquaintance with her children.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Only one,â\\x80\\x99 said Constance with a little sighâ\\x80\\x94 she knew the rule of â\\x80\\x98 eldest firstâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98 then I suppose it will be Alice.â\\x80\\x99 * Well, it would naturally be Alice, of course, but as she seems to have taken such a violent dislike to the little Conynghams, I suppose she will not care to goâ\\x80\\x94eh, Alice ?â\\x80\\x99 Alice did not answer; she was looking at the cards. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure sheâ\\x80\\x99s not a nice person,â\\x80\\x99 she said ; â\\x80\\x98 her cards are not thick, like mammaâ\\x80\\x99s ; they are horrid thin things, like paper ; and if sheâ\\x80\\x99s not nice, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure her children wonâ\\x80\\x99t be nice.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t think that follows, Alice,â\\x80\\x99 said her father; \\'at least, I know little girls with nice mammas, who are anything but nice themselves sometimes.â\\x80\\x99 Alice felt rather shy, for she guessed what her papa meant, and she went to the hall-window, for she knew she was going to blush. Just as she got there, she heard merry voices, andINDIA N-R UBBER BALL. 149 the fair-haired children passed along the pavement on their way home. The eldest boy was carrying the camp-stool for his governess, the little girl was carrying the book, and the small boy was weighed down by the indian-rubber ball. They were talk 172 ing and laughing with their governess in French, and making plans for next day. Alice heard them say they would be able to build sand castles in the morning, because the tide would be so far out. How delicious it sounded ! and, oh ! if only she could go and build sand castles with them. She remained gazing out of the window long after they had gone by. â\\x80\\x98 Well, Alice,â\\x80\\x99 said her mother, â\\x80\\x98 I am waiting to know if you want to go with me to-morrow.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, thank you, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 said Alice, turning round and speaking very decidedly ; â\\x80\\x98 I am more than ever sure that I shall never care to know the little Conynghams.â\\x80\\x99 CHAPTER II. It was a lovely bright morning next day, and the little Fieldings went down to the beach directly after breakfast. Their mamma bought them some spades on the way, as is the usual custom the first morning at the sea-side. The first thing that Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s eyes fell upon were130 THE CHILDREN WITH THE the three fair-haired children, playing all together as before. They had tied a string round the same indian-rubber ball, and were throwing it out as far as they could in the sea. Then they held the string tight, while the waves washed the ball gradu 172 ally up on the shore. At a little distance the string could not be seen, and Alice thought at first they were throwing the ball recklessly in the water, and could not imagine how it always came safely back. â\\x80\\x98 What delicious games they do have!â\\x80\\x99 she sighed. â\\x80\\x98 Who, dear ?â\\x80\\x99 asked Mrs. Fielding. â\\x80\\x98 Why, the same little boys and girl that I want to know so much,â\\x80\\x99 returned Alice, despondently. â\\x80\\x98Come and play, Ally,â\\x80\\x99 said Constance; â\\x80\\x98weâ\\x80\\x99ll have a very nice game.â\\x80\\x99 Alice was not much inclined to at first, but the new spade and beach-basket tempted her at last, and she joined her sister in digging holes in the shingle, and filling the beach-baskets with the pret 172 tiest little stones that they could find. The tide was going gradually out, and the sand beginning to appear. As soon as it was dry enough to stand on, the fair-haired children left off their game, and began to build a castle on the sand. At this sight Alice got disgusted with her own game, and her longing eyes watched every move 172 ment of the children with the keenest interest. Constance tried to recall her attention in vain. Alice imperceptibly began to move away from her sister, and to get nearer to the other children. Constance was rather disconsolate at being leftINDIAN-RUBBER BALL. to play alone; but after calling to her sister once or twice, and seeing it was of no use, she gave it up and went on digging by herself. By-and-by, Mr. Fielding came down on the beach, and carried his wife off for a little walk on the Esplanade. â\\x80\\x98The children will be quite safe here,â\\x80\\x99he said, â\\x80\\x98 and we shall see them from the top of the cliff.â\\x80\\x99 Constance felt a little forlorn when they were out of sight, and looked anxiously after Alice. She was a good way off now, for she was standing be 172 tween the sea and the place where the children were building their castle. She was getting closer and closer to them, and Constance thought she must be talking to them, she seemed so very near. But she went on with her game at last, for she saw it was no use waiting for her sister, and she began making a sand roley-poley pudding, and sticking little stones in it to look like currants. She was rather pleased with it when it was finished, it looked so like a real pudding, and she cut quite thin slices off it with her spade. She could see her papa and mamma sitting on a seat on the Espla 172 nade, so she felt quite happy, particularly when they kissed their hands and nodded to her. All of a sudden, somebody rushed past her and plunged down on the shingle. Constance was much startled, for the person, whoever it was, brushed so roughly up against her, that she was almost knocked over. She turned round, and saw to her astonishment that it was Alice ! Alice, with a very152 THE CHILDREN WITH THE red face, and rather sparkling eyes, sitting on the beach, throwing the pebbles about, and looking very much put out. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, Ally ! how you made me jump !â\\x80\\x99 she ex 172 claimed, running up to her sister. 1 Why, what is the matter ?â\\x80\\x99 But Alice would not tell her, and seemed very excited. â\\x80\\x98 Whatâ\\x80\\x99s become of mamma ?â\\x80\\x99 she asked. â\\x80\\x98 Sheâ\\x80\\x99s up there,â\\x80\\x99 said Constance, pointing to the Esplanade. â\\x80\\x98 Up where?â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Alice, jumping up from her seat ; â\\x80\\x98 show me, quick, Constance !â\\x80\\x99 Constance pointed to the seat on the Esplanade, where Mr. and Mrs. Fielding were still sitting, and repeated, â\\x80\\x98 Up there, with papa.â\\x80\\x99 Alice got very red, and looked rather frightened. â\\x80\\x98 Why do you blush so ?â\\x80\\x99 inquired Constance. Alice would not say at first, but Constance begged her so hard to tell her, that she yielded at last, and confessed what had happened. It seemed that when she first went towards the fair-haired children, she had only meant to watch their game for a minute, and then return to her sister ; but the nearer she got, the more delicious did the game appear. They had made a lovely castle of sand, with pebbles all round the tops of the walls ; and just as she came up they were making little holes for guns. There was a little moat all round for water, and every wave that broke on the shore helped to fill it. They were settlingINDIAN-RUBBER BALL. 153 together that they would put the indian-rubber ball on the top for a sort of dome, and the youngest boy ran off to the beach, where his governess was sitting, to fetch it. It was just then that Alice thought she would go and stand on the other side, to see how the castle would look from the sea. When she got there, she perceived for the first time that Constance was playing alone on the sand in the distance, and that her mamma was nowhere to be seen. The temptation to join the childrenâ\\x80\\x99s game had been very strong before, and now it became stronger than ever. Alice was not naturally disobedient, and at first she violently repelled the thought, but when they stuck the ball on the top of the castle, with a flag on a stick in the little hole, and all shouted, â\\x80\\x98Hurrah!â\\x80\\x99 she could not help saying â\\x80\\x98 Hurrah,â\\x80\\x99 too ; it did look so very jolly. â\\x80\\x98Now we must storm the castle !â\\x80\\x99 said the eldest boy, and they began throw 172 ing stones against the sand walls. This was t.oo much ; Alice could stand it no longer, and she ran up to the children and said, â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! may I help you to knock it down ?â\\x80\\x99 The little girl looked rather surprised, and then, drawing herself up, she said very civilly, but very decidedly, â\\x80\\x98 We are not allowed to play with any 172 body mamma does not know.â\\x80\\x99 The words were hardly out of her mouth before Alice turned round and ran back to Constance as hard as she could, her cheeks burning, and some-154 THE CHILDREN WITH THE tiling very like tears glistening in her eyes. Never in all her life had she felt so disgraced. She fancied, as she ran, that she heard the children laughing at her, and, hurried as she was, she could not help turning round to see if they were looking after her; but they were only storming the castle and laugh 172 ing over their game. When she came up to Constance, playing so quietly and happily with her roley-poley pudding, she wished heartily she had never left herâ\\x80\\x94for what good had she done ? She had lost all her fun with her sisterâ\\x80\\x94for it was nearly time to go home ; she had been refused by the fair-haired children ; and, worse than all, she had disobeyed her mother and father, and they would probably be very much displeased with her. It was a sad business, certainly, and Constance did not know what to say to comfort Alice, when she had finished her story. The little girls were still talking it over when they heard their father calling them from the steps to come home. Constance ran towards him, and Alice followed slowly, feeling very much ashamed of herself. â\\x80\\x98 Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Fielding, â\\x80\\x98 and how have you en 172 joyed your morning ?â\\x80\\x99 Alice did not answer, for she didnâ\\x80\\x99t know what to say ; but Constance was full of all the fun she had had on the sand. â\\x80\\x98 But how came you to leave poor Constance all alone, Alice ?â\\x80\\x99 asked her mother.INDIAN-RUB BER BALL. ISS Alice hung her head, and got very red indeed. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got something to tell you, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 she said, in a very low voice. â\\x80\\x98 Would you rather wait till we get home ?â\\x80\\x99 asked Mrs. Fielding, for she saw how very shaky Alice was, and she was rather afraid of a scene on the Esplanade. â\\x80\\x98Oh no,â\\x80\\x99 said Alice, â\\x80\\x98I canâ\\x80\\x99t wait; Iâ\\x80\\x99d much rather tell you at once. Mamma, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been very disobedient, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done what you told me not, for I went and asked those little children to let me play with them ;â\\x80\\x99 and Alice looked up anxiously in her motherâ\\x80\\x99s face to see if she was very angry. But Mrs. Fielding only answered very quietly, â\\x80\\x98 I am glad you are honest about it, Alice, for it would have been no use trying to hide it, as I was watching you the whole time.â\\x80\\x99 * And were you very angry, mamma ?â\\x80\\x99 faltered Alice. â\\x80\\x98 I was more surprised than angry,â\\x80\\x99 answered her mother. 1 1 did not think you would have so flatly disobeyed me. Your father could hardly believe his eyes when he saw you go up to the little girl.â\\x80\\x99 Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s eyes filled with tears, but before she had time to answer, her mother went on : â\\x80\\x98 But what did the little girl say, Alice ; and what made you run away so quickly ?â\\x80\\x99 Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s face worked with several conflicting feel 172 ings, and the answer was so low that her mother could hardly catch it. Mrs. Fielding did not say anything more. She156 THE CHILDREN WITH THE knew what a proud child Alice was, and felt that her wounded vanity was punishment enough. Alice felt very much humbled and very peni 172 tent, and they walked home in silence. CHAPTER III. â\\x80\\x98WELL,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Fielding, at luncheon, â\\x80\\x98who is to come with us to see the little Conynghams ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Constance,â\\x80\\x99 answered his wife. â\\x80\\x98 Alice has made up her mind she does not want to know them.â\\x80\\x99 Alice felt very sorry, when she saw them all start, that she had been so hasty in settling she would not go ; for it was very dull to be left all alone ; and she stood watching them from the window, feeling rather forlorn. She did not exactly know what to do with herself while they were away, and the time seemed very long indeed. It must have been nearly an hour and a half before she heard the hall-door open, and her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s and motherâ\\x80\\x99s voices. She ran down to meet them. â\\x80\\x98 Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Fielding, â\\x80\\x98 and what have you been doing with yourself all the afternoon ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been very dull indeed,â\\x80\\x99 answered Alice. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m so glad youâ\\x80\\x99ve come home. But whereâ\\x80\\x99s Con 172 stance ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 She is going to stay to tea with the little Conynghams,â\\x80\\x99 answered her mother. â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t think she will be back till bed-time.â\\x80\\x99INDIAN-RUBBER BALL. 157 * Oh dear, what a bother !â\\x80\\x99 said Alice ; 1 I shall have no one to play with all day.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid no one to walk with either/ answered her mother ; â\\x80\\x98 for your father and I are going to drive with Mrs. Conyngham. However/ she added, â\\x80\\x98 it is quite your own doing ; for you could have gone to the little Conynghamsâ\\x80\\x99 if you had liked.â\\x80\\x99 Alice was silent, but she looked very grave. â\\x80\\x98Are the little Conynghams nice?â\\x80\\x99 she asked, presently. â\\x80\\x98Yes; they seemed charming children, as far as I could judge from just seeing them for a few minutes in the drawing-room; but Constance will be able to tell you all about them when she comes home.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Have they got dark hair ?â\\x80\\x99 asked Alice, 1 and how many of them are there ? and how old are they ? and are they boys or girls ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Upon my word, Alice/ said her father, â\\x80\\x98you seem very inquisitive about the little Conynghams, considering you do not wish to know them, and are quite sure you will never like them. However, if you really are anxious to know, you have only got to look out of the window presently, for I heard them arranging with Constance that they would all go into the square.â\\x80\\x99 Then Mrs. Fielding went up to her room to dress for her drive, and Alice followed her. It certainly was very funny, considering, as Mr. Fielding had said, how very little Alice had cared158 THE CHILDREN WITH THE to make acquaintance with the little Conynghams, that she should be so anxious to see them, and should pop up and down to the window as many times as she did, while her mother was getting ready, to see if they had arrived in the square. Presently she heard a carriage stop at the door, and in a few minutes a message was sent up that Mrs. Conyngham had called for Mrs. Fielding. â\\x80\\x98 Good-bye, Alice, dear,â\\x80\\x99 said her mother. â\\x80\\x98 I am afraid you will be very dull by yourself ; but re 172 member, it is your own fault.â\\x80\\x99 Alice felt half inclined to ask to be allowed to join the Conynghams and Constance in the square, but could not summon up courage; so she kissed her mamma without speaking, and remained stand 172 ing by the dressing-table after she was gone, feeling very dull and deserted. Presently a merry laugh in the square attracted her attention, and she ran to the window. There, first thing, were the fair-haired children playing with the indian-rubber ball, and with an impatient stamp of her foot Alice turned away. She was quite glad now she had not asked her mamma to let her join the little Conynghams. She was quite sure she should have enjoyed no other play while that de 172 licious ball game was going on right under her eyes, nor cared for any companions but the pretty fair-haired children. Besides, she felt rather shy of the little girl now, and had an uncomfortable recollection of the way she had drawn herself up, and said, * We are not allowed to play with anyINDIA N-RUBBER BALL. 159 one our mamma does not know.â\\x80\\x99 Still, she liked watching them very much, and soon moved to the window again. Yes, there they were, standing in a sort of ring, throwing the ball from one to the other as fast as possible. How charming it looked ! But stopâ\\x80\\x94there are four of them to-day, or is it a friend they have got with them ? There are four figures in the ring, and the fourth figure is a new oneâ\\x80\\x94a little girl. How is it that the figure is so familiar to Alice? Why does she seem to know so well the long brown hair, and the hat, and the coat, and everything ? Can it beâ\\x80\\x94is itâ\\x80\\x94it is Constance, her own sister Constance, playing with the fair-haired children, and seeming as friendly as possible. â\\x80\\x98Oh! how naughty of Constance!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Alice ; â\\x80\\x98 she has asked them to let her play with them. How could she ?â\\x80\\x99 and, forgetting her own recent disobedience in her indignation at her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s, Alice ran out of the room with a scarlet face, and dashed downstairs two steps at a time. â\\x80\\x98 Mamma â\\x80\\x94mamma !â\\x80\\x99 she cried, as she caught sight of her mother in the hall just going towards the carriage at the door ; â\\x80\\x98 stop a minute. I want to speak to you. Please come upstairs for a minute.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 All the way up again ?â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Fielding, smiling ; but she made no objection, and followed Alice into the room she had lately quitted. Breathlessly, Alice dragged her to the window, and pointed to the group in the square.THE CHILDREN WITH THE â\\x80\\x98Just look! mamma/ she said. But instead of the look of astonishment and dis 172 pleasure which Alice expected to see on her motherâ\\x80\\x99s face, she saw no change from its usual placid expres 172 sion, and Mrs. Fielding, after looking all over the square, turned to her, and said : â\\x80\\x98 I don\\'t see anything particular, Alice.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Why, mamma! just look at Constance! did you ever know anything so disobedient â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Except yourself this morning,â\\x80\\x99 finished Mrs. Fielding; â\\x80\\x98 is that what you were going to say V Alice hung her head and blushed. â\\x80\\x98 I forgot,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98 But you are mistaken,â\\x80\\x99 continued her mother ; â\\x80\\x98 Constance is not disobeying me. I only forbid your playing with children I do not know, and I know those little boys and that little girl quite well.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What, mamma !â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Alice ; â\\x80\\x98you know them ?â\\x80\\x94you know those children with the indian- rubber ball ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, Alice,â\\x80\\x99 said her mother, laying both her hands on her little daughterâ\\x80\\x99s shoulders, and look 172 ing into her face with a smile, â\\x80\\x98 I do. Those â\\x80\\x9c children with the indian-rubber ball,â\\x80\\x9d as you call them, are the little Conynghams.â\\x80\\x99INDIAN-RUBBER BALL. 161 CHAPTER IV. I THINK it would have made anybody laugh to see Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s face at that moment ! Such a curious mixture of feeling was depicted on it. Uncertainty, perplexity, pleasure, dismay, and blank astonishment by turns expressed themselves in rapid succession. Then she began to pour forth a string of ques 172 tions ; but before Mrs. Fielding was able to satisfy one inquiry, her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s voice was heard on the stairs, asking whether she knew that she was keep 172 ing Mrs. Conyngham waiting all this time; and so she was obliged to hurry off. She had time, however, to kiss Alice, and to give her leave to join the others in the square. I think she felt sorry for her, standing there with her blushing face and downcast eyes, and felt that she had been punished enough by losing the luncheon and fun with her beloved fair-haired children, without being condemned to a solitary afternoon in the house on such a beautiful day. But faults are their own punishment, and we cannot do wrong without suffering for it ; so, though Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s mother was so kind and forgiving, Alice was not to go unpunished, as we shall see. She went to the window to see the carriage drive off, and she blushed more than ever when she saw how her father and mother and Mrs. Conyngham 11162 THE CHILDREN WITH THE were talking and laughing in the carriage ; for she fancied they must be talking about her. â\\x80\\x98 It was very disagreeable to be laughed at,â\\x80\\x99 she reflected, as she stood rather sulkily at the window, gazing at the retreating carriage, â\\x80\\x98 and it was alto 172 gether very tiresome, and she wished none of it had ever happened.â\\x80\\x99 As the carriage rounded the square, it passed near where the children were playing, and Alice saw the little boys wave their hats, and the little girl and Constance kiss their hands to it as it drove by. On seeing this, Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s spirits suddenly rose. Every disagreeable feeling connected with the affair was instantly swallowed up in the one de 172 lightful thought that the eagerly desired privilege was hers at last, and that she was free to go and play with those delightful children now! at once! this instant! and for as long as ever she chose. She jumped about the room like a mad thing, and then flew upstairs to put on her things. She was just ready, when her motherâ\\x80\\x99s maid came into the room. â\\x80\\x98 Where are you going, Miss Alice ?â\\x80\\x99 said she. â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! donâ\\x80\\x99t stop me !â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Alice, fearing she was going to be told she must have her hair done again, or must put on another pair of boots ; â\\x80\\x98 I am in a great hurry, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m going into the square.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Going into the square like that, Miss ! Why,INDIAN-RUBBER BALL. you have got on your beach-boots and your brown liolland frock, that you were messing in on the sand all the morning.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh! never mind,â\\x80\\x99 said Alice, almost dancing with impatience ; â\\x80\\x98 it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter a bit, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m so late.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure, Miss Alice, your mamma wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t let you go out like that, if she were at home. You had better come and change your frock.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! Miller,â\\x80\\x99 said Alice, almost crying, â\\x80\\x98 it would take me an hour : I canâ\\x80\\x99t wait, really.â\\x80\\x99 Miller began to get angry. â\\x80\\x98You ought not to go like that, miss, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure. Why, Miss Constance has got on her Indian silk suit, and her best hat with the blue feather.â\\x80\\x99 But before she had come to the end of her sen 172 tence, Alice was scampering downstairs. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure mamma wonâ\\x80\\x99t mind,â\\x80\\x99 she said to her 172 self as she ran. â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s only Miller.â\\x80\\x99 But she felt a little uncomfortable all the time, and very much wished Miller had not happened to come into the room at that particular moment. â\\x80\\x98Everything is so unfortunate to-day,â\\x80\\x99 she mut 172 tered. â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s the most disagreeable day I ever spent, that it is.â\\x80\\x99 And by the time she reached the hall-door, she was quite tearful at the thought of what an unfor 172 tunate creature she was, and how everything went wrong with her. When children are in a bad frame of mind them 172 selves, they are so apt to think everybody and 11â\\x80\\x942THE CHILDREN WITH THE everything is wrong ; and they fail to see that the fauit lies in themselves. She crossed the road, and opened the square- gate. Then she looked all round for her sister and the children. She got quite cheery again, at the thought of the pleasure in store for her ; she tried to remember how she had felt the day before, watching the children at play, and feeling she must not join them. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s net such a very disagreeable day, after all,â\\x80\\x99 she said to herself. â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s much nicer than yester 172 day.â\\x80\\x99 She caught sight of the group in the distance, and stood still for a moment, that she might enjoy the feeling to the full of being able to do what she had so ardently wished. As a cat plays with a mouse before devouring it, did Alice toy with her pleasure, feeling it was hers whenever she chose to take advantage of it. Then she set off running with all her might. But before she had got half-way across the grass, she saw Constance and the governess, with the little boy, walk away to the other end of the square, and go out at the gate which faced the sea, leaving the eldest boy and girl alone. Alice stopped short in her run, to wonder what could be the reason of this. She hoped very much that Constance would soon be back, for she felt a little shy of going up to the little girl after theIA\\'DIAN-RUBBER BALL. repulse of the morning, if her sister were not there. The nearer she got to the children, the shyer she felt. The little girl looked so exactly the same as she had when she had drawn herself up, and said, â\\x80\\x98 We are not allowed to play with anyone mamma does not know,â\\x80\\x99 that it brought back to Alice her feelings of the morning very disagreeably, and she felt half inclined to turn back. But she felt so sure that the little Conynghams would guess that she was Constanceâ\\x80\\x99s sister, and come to meet her in a minute, that she persevered. She was now so close that she could hear every word they said ; but neither boy nor girl took the slightest notice of her, and went on talking to 172 gether just as if she were not there. â\\x80\\x98 I hope Constance will soon be back,â\\x80\\x99 she heard the little girl say. â\\x80\\x98 Which shop have they gone to ?â\\x80\\x99 1 Oh ! itâ\\x80\\x99s a good way down the Esplanade,â\\x80\\x99 an 172 swered the boy. â\\x80\\x98 They canâ\\x80\\x99t be back for ten minutes or a quarter-of-an-hour.â\\x80\\x99 Alice began to think they could not have seen her, and gave two or three little coughs to attract their attention. She succeeded at last, for the little girl turned round and looked up. But though she looked Alice full in the face, she did not smile, or come forward, or show the slightest sign of recognition. Alice, standing there, with her face all smiles,166 THE CHILDREN WITH THE and her hand almost outstretched, expecting every moment to be recognised as Constanceâ\\x80\\x99s sister, felt so abashed that she got hot and uncomfortable all over. â\\x80\\x98 I say, Edred,â\\x80\\x99 she heard his sister say in a low voice, â\\x80\\x98 what a funny little girl that is ; she is always staring at us.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s the same little girl that wanted to play with us this morning, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x99 Edred answered. â\\x80\\x98I wop- der why she stares so ; itâ\\x80\\x99s very rude of her.â\\x80\\x99 * Itâ\\x80\\x99s rather a bore,â\\x80\\x99 said his sister ; â\\x80\\x98 letâ\\x80\\x99s move away a little.â\\x80\\x99 And they both walked off. Poor Alice ! Fancy her feelings on hearing this! She wished she could hide herself away somewhere, and never, never see the little Conynghams again ! She felt more disgraced than ever, and heartily wished she had never come in the square, never been on the beach, never come to Brighton ! Blushing all over, and with tears of wounded pride springing to her eyes, she rushed off, and went and hid herself in a little summer-house at the other end of the square. â\\x80\\x98 What was she to do next ?â\\x80\\x99 she asked herself. She longed to go home and shut herself up in her motherâ\\x80\\x99s bedroom, and wait there till she came home to console and advise her. But she was positively ashamed to cross the grass to the gate, for fear of meeting the little Conyng 172 hams. Her one wish now was to escape from the very children she had so longed to be with only yesterday.INDIAN-RUBBER BALL. 167 How her feelings had changed in one short day ! And that it was all her own fault, did not make it any the pleasanter to think of. She told herself, now, that if only she had been obedient and contented, like Constance, none of it would have happened. â\\x80\\x98 Oh dear ! oh dear !â\\x80\\x99 she sighed, â\\x80\\x98 why did I ever go and ask them to let me play ?â\\x80\\x99 Why, indeed ! Alice was now, as we said she would, finding out that wrongdoing is its own punishment. What a humiliating position she was now in : shut up in a stuffy little summer-house, not even daring to run across the square and go home. After a time, she got so tired of her imprison 172 ment that she crept to the door of the summer 172 house and peeped out to see what they were all doing, and what chance there was of her escaping unobserved. Constance had come back now, and they were all standing in a group, talking. But not even the sight of her sister made Alice wish to join the children ; she felt too humiliated, too disgraced. It would be impossible to proclaim herself the â\\x80\\x98 rude little girl who stares so,â\\x80\\x99 even though Constance should, at the same time, intro 172 duce her as her sister. No ! her only wish now was to pass without being seen, and to get safely home again. As she stood there, watching her opportunity, something in Constanceâ\\x80\\x99s attire seemed to strike her. She took off her own hat and looked at it with168 THE CHILDREN WITH THE a puzzled expression, and then looked at her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s. Her own was black straw, with a pheasantâ\\x80\\x99s feather. Constanceâ\\x80\\x99s was white straw, with a light blue feather. She looked down at herself, and saw a brown holland suit trimmed with dark blue braid. She glanced at her sister again, and saw an Indian silk suit, with a light blue sash. â\\x80\\x98 Why ! good gracious,â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98 we are not dressed alike ! I quite forgot that. No wonder they didnâ\\x80\\x99t guess we were sisters.â\\x80\\x99 A flush of shame dyed her cheeks as she thought of Miller. â\\x80\\x98 Oh dear ! I wish Iâ\\x80\\x99d changed it when she told me. Why didnâ\\x80\\x99t I ? If I only had, of course they would have known who I was directly.â\\x80\\x99 Poor Alice ! the fruits of disobedience were visiting her pretty sharply, and yet she had no one to blame but herself. But while she stood there lamenting, she sud 172 denly saw a movement among the children she was watching ; and to her horror, the group turned to 172 wards her and made straight for the summer-house, running with all their might. She was at her witsâ\\x80\\x99 end ! She felt regularly caught in a trap. If she ran out she must meet them ; if she re 172 mained where she was she must inevitably be discovered.INDIAN-RUBBER BALL. What was to be done ? She stooped down and looked under the seat, to see if there was room to squeeze in there and hide herself. But it did not look inviting. It was dirty and dusty, and swarming with insects, and she could not make up her mind to take a seat among them. And yet something must be done, and done quickly too, for she could hear the steps and voices getting nearer and nearer every moment. She looked all round her like a startled deer who feels that the hounds are gaining upon him, and that not a moment must be lost. The summer-house was very much out of repair, and at one corner there was a place where the twigs and branches of which it was composed had given way, leaving a little gap. Quick as lightning Alice dashed towards it, and forced herself through, tearing her frock as she did so, and scratching her hands and face; but she felt nothing, cared for nothing, so anxious was she to get away in time. She had only just managed to squeeze herself through and to look about her, when she found that there was no way of getting back again, except by running round in front of the summer 172 house, or by returning the way she had come, for a hedge ran all round the arbour, and there was only a very narrow little path between it and the hedge. So here she was, once more in a trap.170 THE CHILDREN WITH THE She carefully drew her frock tight round her, lest a little bit should show through the gap, and stooping down, made herself as small as possible. This was hardly accomplished when the Co- nynghams and Constance arrived in the summer 172 house. They were hot and breathless with their run, and all sat down on the seat to rest, Ed red swinging his legs backwards and forwards with such energy that Alice, catching sight of his boots from her hiding-place, felt thankful that she was not under the seat. She certainly would have received more kicks than would have been pleasant. The children soon began to talk. â\\x80\\x98 But what is she like, Eva ?â\\x80\\x99 said Constance ; â\\x80\\x98 I should so like to see her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well ! she must be somewhere in the square,â\\x80\\x99 answered Eva, â\\x80\\x98 so I will show her to you presently ; but\\'thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing very very odd about her, except that she stands and stares so. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it funny that she should wander about all alone ? Sheâ\\x80\\x99s got no mother,,or governess, or anybody with her.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Perhaps sheâ\\x80\\x99s mad,â\\x80\\x99 suggested Constance. â\\x80\\x98 She may be,â\\x80\\x99 said Eva, â\\x80\\x98 only she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t look mad. Itâ\\x80\\x99s only that she stares so.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Perhaps sheâ\\x80\\x99s an idiot,â\\x80\\x99 said Constance. â\\x80\\x98 I saw an idiot once who stared horribly. Does her tongue hang out ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh no,â\\x80\\x99 answered Eva ; â\\x80\\x98 sheâ\\x80\\x99s quite like any 172 body else, if it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t for the staring. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s rather like you, Constance ; sheâ\\x80\\x99s got the same sort ofINDIAN-RUBEER BALL. eyes. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s a pretty little girl, I think, and doesn\\'t look a bit silly ; I think sheâ\\x80\\x99s only rude.â\\x80\\x99 I think sheâ\\x80\\x99s a ghost/ laughed Edred, â\\x80\\x98 for she came up to us so softly that we didnâ\\x80\\x99t hear her till she was quite close, and now sheâ\\x80\\x99s disappeared so quick that I think she must have melted into air.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Eva, whatâ\\x80\\x99s a ghost ?â\\x80\\x99 asked the small boy, rather fearfully. â\\x80\\x98Oh, itâ\\x80\\x99s only nonsense, Harry darling, there isnâ\\x80\\x99t really such a thing in the world. Edred,â\\x80\\x99 concluded Eva, in a lower voice, â\\x80\\x98you shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t talk about ghosts and rubbish before Harry. Mamma told you not.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 persisted Edred, â\\x80\\x98I always thought them all nonsense till to-day ; but when a little girl dis 172 appears before your very eyes, and you donâ\\x80\\x99t even hear a gate bang, I Hark ! whatâ\\x80\\x99s that ?â\\x80\\x99 Little Harry almost screamed, and all the other children started up, but they heard nothing. â\\x80\\x98Oh, Edred, I wish you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t make one jump so !â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Eva, â\\x80\\x98 and youâ\\x80\\x99ve frightened poor Harry.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s all very well,â\\x80\\x99 laughed Edred, â\\x80\\x98 but it made me jump, too.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What was it you heard ?â\\x80\\x99 asked Constance. â\\x80\\x98 It was a sort of rustle outside the summer 172 house, and a sort of noise like somebody crying or breathing very hard. Listen ! there it is again.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, nonsense,â\\x80\\x99 said Eva ; â\\x80\\x98 itâ\\x80\\x99s only the wind in the trees. Letâ\\x80\\x99s talk about something else ; Harryâ\\x80\\x99s172 THE CHILDREN WITH THE getting quite white. Would you like to go back to mademoiselle, Harry dear ?â\\x80\\x99 Harry gladly caught at any means of escape from the land of terrors in which he had been an unwilling sojourner for the last few minutes, and Eva took him by the hand and led him aw r ay. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be back in a minute,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98I suppose youâ\\x80\\x99re all deaf?â\\x80\\x99 resumed Edred, when Harry was gone, â\\x80\\x98for I know I heard the noise twice. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve a great mind to look all round the summer-house to see what it is. I certainly shall, too, if I hear it again.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Have you ever seen this little girl before ?â\\x80\\x99 asked Constance. â\\x80\\x98Yes, this morning; when we were playing on the beach she came and stood staring at us like she did just no-v, and at last she rushed up to Eva, and asked her if she might help to storm the castle. Wasnâ\\x80\\x99t it funny ?â\\x80\\x99 But Constance didnâ\\x80\\x99t answer, and seemed to be turning something over in her mind, for she looked puzzled. â\\x80\\x98What are you thinking about ?â\\x80\\x99 asked Edred. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking about what you said,â\\x80\\x99 she answered ; and then she added, half to herself, â\\x80\\x98 it must be Alice.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Whoâ\\x80\\x99s Alice ?â\\x80\\x99 inquired he. â\\x80\\x98 Why, Alice, my sister.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Your sister?â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Edred,opening his eyes very wide. â\\x80\\x98 If itâ\\x80\\x99s the same who spoke to you on the beachINDIAN-RUBBER BALL 173 to-day, it must be Alice,â\\x80\\x99 began Constance, and then she stopped, and seemed rather bored at having said so much. But Edred was not at all inclined to let the sub 172 ject drop. â\\x80\\x98 Was it Alice who asked Eva to let her play with us this morning ?â\\x80\\x99 he inquired, astonished. Constance hesitated for a minute, and then said, â\\x80\\x98 Yes.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Why didnâ\\x80\\x99t you tell us so before?â\\x80\\x99 said Edred, dismayed. â\\x80\\x98 I didnâ\\x80\\x99t like to tell tales,â\\x80\\x99 said Constance, simply. Edred remained in a state of such bewilder 172 ment and surprise that he didnâ\\x80\\x99t speak for some minutes ; and then he suddenly burst out laugh 172 ing â\\x80\\x98And weâ\\x80\\x99ve been calling her mad, and a ghost, and all sorts of things. Why, you called her an idiot, yourself, Constance. You asked if her tongue hung out ! Your own sister !â\\x80\\x99 And Edred was so tickled at the idea, that he rolled about the summer-house, convulsed. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, letâ\\x80\\x99s come and tell Eva. She will be so surprised !â\\x80\\x99 So saying, he bounded out of the summer-house, and ran across the grass towards his sister, followed by Constance. We must now return to Alice, whom we left squeezed up in a little corner outside the arbour. Poor child ! she had indeed had a sorry time of174 THE CHILDREN WITH THE it during the childrenâ\\x80\\x99s conversation, every word of which she had, of course, overheard. To begin with, she was most uncomfortable, for her attitude was such a cramped one, that her legs soon got quite stiff, and so did her back and shoulders. Yet she did not dare move, for fear of being discovered. Once or twice she had tried to shift her position a little, for the discomfort amounted almost to pain ; but each time she had attracted Edredâ\\x80\\x99s attention, and had at last been obliged to give it up. When they first began to talk about her, her pride had been sadly wounded to find she was considered an odd little girl, who wandered about alone and stared ; but when it came to being called mad, and an idiot, and to hear her own sister ask if her tongue hung out, she could not stand it. Hot tears of mortification rose to her eyes, and, as the conversation went on, ran down her cheeks ; till, in spite of all her efforts to keep it back, a sob escaped her, and, as we have seen, attracted the attention of the children in the arbour. Her heart beat loudly when she heard Edred announce his intention of searching all round the summer-house if he heard the noise again ; and with all her might she struggled to keep her sobs down, lest he should carry his threat into execution. It was almost more than she could manage, how 172 ever, and she certainly would not have lasted much longer without betraying herself, had it not beenINDIAN-RUB BER BALI. 175 for Edred and Constanceâ\\x80\\x99s sudden exit from the arbour, in search of Eva. Then, with one bound, Alice sprang from her hiding-place, struggled through the gap, and dashed away through the summer-house out into the square, flying across the grass to the gate as fast as her legs could carry her. The pent-up tears burst forth as she ran, for she could restrain them no longer. She was close to the gate, when, to her dismay, she heard shouts behind her, and glancing hurriedly round, she saw the three little Conynghams and Constance in full pursuit. They were calling to her as they came, and Constance was begging her to stop ; but to Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s excited ear they seemed to be jeering and laugh 172 ing; and she ran on faster than ever, sobbing and crying as she went. Fortunately for her the gate was open, and she dashed through it, giving it a tremendous bang behind her, to prevent the others following. Into the road she ran, without looking to the right hand or the left, and without perceiving that a carriage was coming rapidly up the road. The coachman, seeing her danger, called out loudly to her to get out of the way ; and Alice, startled and confused, lost her footing, and fell down right under the horsesâ\\x80\\x99 hoofs. There were shouts from the passers-by, screams from the children at the gate; the horses were pulled back upon their haunches ; and a gentleman,176 THE CHILDREN WITH THE leaping from the carriage, lifted Alice up in his arms and carried her into the house. It was Mr. Fielding. It all happened so quickly that Alice had not time to be frightened, only very bewildered ; and she could not think why her father laid her so carefully down upon the sofa, and asked in such an anxious voice if she was much hurt ; calling her his darling, his poor child, over and over again. She forgot what a pitiable object she was, with her face swollen and stained with crying, and the tears still standing on her cheeks; her forehead and hands scratched and bleeding, and her hair all in disorder. It was no wonder that Mr. Fielding thought the horses must have stepped upon her, or that she must have been injured by her fall on the stones. It was in vain that Alice assured him she was not hurt at all; and he was not the least convinced when Mrs. Fielding came breathlessly in, followed by Mrs. Conyngham and Miller, and they made even more fuss over Alice than he had done: all refusing to believe her repeated assurances. No one could feel satisfied that she was not in someway injured, so long as the tears and scratches were unaccounted for, and Alice felt ashamed to explain before so many people. â\\x80\\x98 Mamma,â\\x80\\x99 she whispered, trying to pull her mother down to the sofa, â\\x80\\x98 if you will send them away, I will tell you all about it.â\\x80\\x99 So Mr. Fielding and Mrs. Conyngham very good-INDIAN-RUBBER BALL. 177 naturedly went into the next room, and Miller be 172 took herself upstairs. Then, when she was left alone with her mother, Alice told the whole story, from beginning to end. Mrs. Fielding listened with great interest, and when it was quite done she got up, and giving Alice a kiss, she moved to the door, saying : â\\x80\\x98 We will talk it all over presently, but I must go now and tell the story to your father and the others. I will come back directly. Why, what is the matter, darling ?â\\x80\\x99 For Alice was blushing up to her hair. â\\x80\\x98 Oh, mamma ! must you really? Must you tell the little Conynghams ?â\\x80\\x99 * I think it is only fair, dear ; the poor little things were frightened to death at seeing you fall on the road, and it is due to them and to their mother to explain that your tears did not arise from any pain or hurt caused by the accident.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Come back quickly,mamma,â\\x80\\x99was all Alice said on hearing this,and her mother promised not to be long. In about ten minutes she returned. â\\x80\\x98Alice,â\\x80\\x99 she said, smiling, â\\x80\\x98 Mrs. Conyngham and her children have sent you an especial message to say how glad they all are to hear you were not hurt ; and to say they hope that, as soon as you are sufficiently rested, you will join them in the square, and return with them to tea afterwards.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, mamma,â\\x80\\x99 said Alice, blushing crimson, â\\x80\\x98 I would much rather not. Please say no. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t, really.â\\x80\\x99 n178 THE CHILDREN WITH THE â\\x80\\x98 And yet this time yesterday you would have thought it the height of happiness to receive such an invitation from the â\\x80\\x9cfair-haired children with the indian-rubber ball.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, yes, mamma ; but everything is changed since then. I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t like it now.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What has changed, dear ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, everything ; the day, and the square, and everything.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I see no difference, Alice. The day is as lovely, the sea is as calm, the square is as gay, and the games going on as merrily as ever/ Alice fidgeted with her handkerchief, and mut 172 tered something about the children. â\\x80\\x98 What ! the little Conynghams ? I think you are mistaken. From the window where I sit, I see them playing with their indian-rubber ball, looking as happy and pretty as they did yesterday. Try again, Alice. What is it that has changed ?â\\x80\\x99 But as Alice was silent, Mrs. Fielding went on. â\\x80\\x98 Did you ever hear, my child, of a beautiful garden in the far east, where all was bright and lovely, and where two happy beings dwelt in perfect happiness, with free permission from an all-bountiful Creator to use and enjoy to the full all that surrounded them, save one thing ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98You mean the Garden of Eden, mamma.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I do. And now, can you tell me what changed to them the aspect of everything, and turned all their joy into misery ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes, mamma : they disobeyed.â\\x80\\x99INDIA N-R UBBER BALL. 179 â\\x80\\x98 Exactly. Disobedience, or in other words, sin, converted that lovely garden into a place of sad 172 ness, and took away all their enjoyment in it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes, everything changed.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But, tell me, what changed ?â\\x80\\x99 * Oh, everything, mamma ; everything.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 How do you mean, everything? Did the flowers lose their beauty, and the birds cease their song ? Did the light turn into darkness, and the trees wither and die ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, no, mamma, not exactly that. I suppose it was all really the same, only it seemed so different to Adam and Eve.â\\x80\\x99 * And why did it seem different ?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I think it was because they felt so different themselves.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Exactly, Alice. They were changed. To them all seemed different, for the poiver of enjoyment was gone. They could not find fault with the beau 172 tiful garden itself, though they looked upon it with different eyes. The fault was in themselves, not in Godâ\\x80\\x99s bright world. And now, Alice, do you see why I told this story ?â\\x80\\x99 Perhaps Alice did not, altogether, but the rising blush on her cheek betrayed that she had a faint suspicion of the reason. Mrs. Fielding did not press her to answer. She waited a minute to see if Alice was going to speak, and then went on : â\\x80\\x98 When you first went into the square, yesterday, and on the beach this morning, you were, like 12â\\x80\\x942i So THE CHILDREN WITH THE Adam and Eve, surrounded by every outward en 172 joyment you could desire. Bright sun, blue skies, soft summer breezes, with health and strength to enjoy all. You had, like them, free permission to use and enjoy everything around you but one thing. And now you say all is alteredâ\\x80\\x94the day, and the square, and everything. Yet, as I tell you, there is no real difference. The outward world is as bright as it was yesterday. It is you, Alice, who, like Adam and Eve, look upon it all with different eyes. To you all seems changed, because you feel different yourself. The bright sea-shore and green grass seem no more different from what they were yesterday and this morning to the happy children playing there, than did the outward aspect of the Garden of Eden after the fall to the happy angels. To Adam and Eve alone did it appear altered. You told me, Alice, what wrought the change to them. Now tell me what has wrought the change to you.â\\x80\\x99 But Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s only answer was to hide her face on her motherâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder; and Mrs. Fielding, kissing her fondly, whispered, â\\x80\\x98You see, donâ\\x80\\x99t you, darling, that it was the same thingâ\\x80\\x94disobedience, or in other words, sin. You cannot, any more than Adam and Eve could, find fault with the outward world, or with the poor little Conynghams. The fault lies in yourself, not in them. The pleasure of their society, which yesterday you desired so ardently, has been converted almost into pain. You shrink from it now almost as much as youINDIAN-RUDBER BALL. i S i longed for it then. Yet they are not to blame, only you. Ah, Alice, it is often so. We mar the innocent enjoyments of this world by our own sin, and then we blame the world instead of blaming ourselves. Try and remember the lesson you have learnt to-day; it will be useful to you all your life. And do not forget, in your prayers to-night, to thank God for sending His Son to save Adam and Eve, and you and I, and all mankind, from the penalties of sin and disobedience. â\\x80\\x98 And now, come up with me into my room,â\\x80\\x99 she concluded, rising from her chair, â\\x80\\x98 and let us see what Miller can do towards restoring that poor scratched face and tangled hair of yours to a little order : then I v/ill take you into the square to meet the little Conynghams. You will not be shy if I come with you, will you, dear ? I assure you they will receive you as if nothing had happened, and I promise you you will find them quite as nice, if not nicer, than you fancied them when you first saw them.â\\x80\\x99 Alice followed her mother upstairs into her room, where they found Miller waiting, and Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s Indian silk suit and white hat with the blue feather spread out on the bed. Alice submitted herself very humbly into Millerâ\\x80\\x99s hands, after glancing hastily at her face to see if she looked triumphant at her having to end in doing what she had so obstinately refused to do before. But Millerâ\\x80\\x99s face wore an expression of puch beaming happiness and kindness that Alicei82 THE CHILDREN WITH THE felt ashamed of having suspected her, and even took occasion to whisper in Millerâ\\x80\\x99s ear that she was sorry she had been so tiresome. â\\x80\\x98Never think of it again, miss,â\\x80\\x99 was Millerâ\\x80\\x99s hearty response ; â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m too glad to see you safe and well to care anything about it.â\\x80\\x99 Which answer rather puzzled Alice, till she re 172 membered her fall on the road, and then she saw that Miller was referring to that. The fact was, poor Miller, attracted by the violent banging of the square-gate, had come to the window just in time to see Alice dash in front of the carriage and fall under the horses. â\\x80\\x98 Well ! you look a little more respectable now, in spite of a scratch here and there,â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Fielding, smiling. â\\x80\\x98 Go into the drawing-room for a minute on your way down, and show yourself to your papa. He is not quite happy about you yet. After that we will start.â\\x80\\x99 Alice ran in to her father, who was delighted to see her looking like herself once more ; and he kissed her many times, telling her how frightened he had been to see her lying on the ground, ap 172 parently bruised and hurt. As soon as Alice found herself in the square with her mother, she felt all her shyness returning, particularly when, at sight of her, the three little Conynghams and Constance left their game, and came rushing to meet her. Before she had time to feel how disagreeable her position was, they were all round her, some kissingINDIAN-RUBBER BALL. her, some holding her hand, and all at once telling her how glad, how very glad they were that she was not hurt ; how dreadfully frightened they had been when they saw her fall ; and how sorry they were for all that had gone before, and for not having recognised her as Constanceâ\\x80\\x99s sister. Alice felt quite confused as she turned from one to the other, and tried to answer what each one said ; but her eyes beamed with pleasure at their rapturous greeting, and at once all feelings of shy 172 ness fled away, and they never returned. In a very little while she was first and foremost in a most energetic game with the indian-rubber ball; and no step was fleeter, no laugh merrier than hers. The little Conynghams proved all, and more, than her wildest expectations had imagined ; and in many a happy game in the square, and merry storming of castles on the sand, did they try to wipe out the recollection of that unfortunate day. But though it gradually grew dim in Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s mind, she never really forgot it. She never cared to talk about it, nor would she laugh over its events, nor turn it all into a joke, as Edred once or twice at 172 tempted to do. Whenever that afternoon did recur to her mind, it was not to think over her half-hour outside the summer-house as a ridiculous adventurer, nor to recall how funny it was that her own sister should have suggested that she was an idiot, and have asked whether her tongue hung out.184 THE INDIAN-RUBBER BALL\\'. No ! she looked upon it all in a more serious light ; and when she thought it over, it helped her to see for herself what her mother had tried to explain to her by the parallel of the history of Adam and Eve, namely, that sin changes the aspect of everything, however fair and innocent. She saw how, in her case, wrong-doing had been its own punishment ; and how what had seemed so desirable to her before she disobeyed had turned into disappointment and worthlessness when within her grasp, through her own fault. Not that the thing wished for was in any way less desirable than she had imagined ; but that â\\x80\\x98 to a disordered mind all things are out of course.â\\x80\\x99 And she never afterwards read the history of the Fall without thinking of her own lesson of obedi 172 ence.

The snow lay thick and crisp on the hard ground, and all the ponds in the neigh 172 bourhood were well frozen over. It was bright winter weather, and the sun was shining in cheerfully at the open door of a cottage at the end of the lane, where lived a poor washerwoman, a widow, and her three children. The inside of the cottage was scru 172 pulously neat and clean ; a good fire crackled merrily in the grate, and a substantial-look- ing pot was sending forth a savoury smell. B 24 THWARTED ; OR, Near the fire sat a little boy, making a wooden soldier, and a nice-looking girl of eighteen was laying the cloth for dinner. The widow herself, with- arms bared to the elbow, was standing at a table in the window, sorting some clothes, preparatory to putting them into the wash-tub. Though worn with hard work, and pre 172 maturely grey, she was evidently still young, and it was easy to see she must once have been very handsome. She had, even now, far more claim to real beauty than her young daughter, though the girl was more pleasing looking, from having an air of greater refinement. The mother was cast in a coarser mould. She was on a larger scale, though she was not so tall ; and she was far more strongly built. Her hands and arms were large and brawny, and looked as if they had doneducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A iiexâ\\x80\\x99s xest. 5 much work in their clay, and done it well. There was energy and determination in her quick step and in her large dark eye. She worked with a will even while sorting the clothes ; and there was that about her whole appearance and in the deep lines in her forehead which seemed to tell of a woman who had fought a hard battle with life and had come off conqueror. The girl moved about quietly, and went through all the preparations for the mid-day meal without hurry or commotion. She was slighter and fairer than her mother. Her hands bore little or no trace of hard work, and the expression of her face was calmer and more thoughtful. Still, it was not without traces of resolu 172 tion ; and it was in this that the two faces were alike.6 THWARTED ; OR, â\\x80\\x98 Where is Bill, mother ? â\\x80\\x99 A shade passed over the widowâ\\x80\\x99s face, and something like a sigh escaped her. â\\x80\\x98He came home from the farm, but I sent him up to the Big House with some clothes.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Why do you sigh, mother ? â\\x80\\x99 asked the young girl, rather quickly. â\\x80\\x98 Billâ\\x80\\x99s got one of his queer fits on him to-day,â\\x80\\x99 she answered. â\\x80\\x98 I did hope he was taking to his work at the farm, and giving his mind to it like a sensible lad ; but to-day he seems as bad as ever.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I wonder what brought it on to-day in particular,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie, half to herself. â\\x80\\x98 How is one to tell ? â\\x80\\x99 said Mrs. Tarver, harshly ; â\\x80\\x98 why canâ\\x80\\x99t he be contented with his lot ? I â\\x80\\x99ve no patience with him. Hacking away with a knife and a bit of wood every spare moment heâ\\x80\\x99s got, instead of goingDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A hexâ\\x80\\x99s xest. 7 heart and soul into his farm work. I know it sends him back to the farm discontented every time, instead of being thankful that lieâ\\x80\\x99s got such a start in life. I often wish,â\\x80\\x99 she added with a sigh, â\\x80\\x98 that God Almighty wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t bestow talents where thereâ\\x80\\x99s no means of making any use of them.â\\x80\\x99 Bessie did not echo her motherâ\\x80\\x99s wish. She gloried in her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s talents, and in the certainty that he was meant for something better than a day labourer. She knew no more than her mother how this meaning in his life was to be brought o C/ out ; but she was younger and more hopeful. The unknown path of life stretching before her was full of possibilities ; and her young eyes looked out upon a vista of bright 172 ness which the poor widowâ\\x80\\x99s were too worn with work and tears to see. â\\x80\\x98And Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid,â\\x80\\x99 the washerwoman8 THWARTED ; OR, went on, glancing wrathfully at the little boy by the fire, â\\x80\\x98 that Billâ\\x80\\x99s example is lead 172 ing Charlie the same silly road. The childâ\\x80\\x99s always messing with a bit of wood, wasting his time. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve a good mind, Bessie, to stop it with him at once, like Iâ\\x80\\x99ve often wished Iâ\\x80\\x99d done to Bill years ago.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have stopped Bill carving by telling, mother,â\\x80\\x99 said the girl proudly, â\\x80\\x98 any more than you could have put your hand on his head and told him not to grow. Heâ\\x80\\x99s the tallest lad in the village,â\\x80\\x99 she added, as if to change the subject. â\\x80\\x98Worse luck,â\\x80\\x99 said the washerwoman. â\\x80\\x98 How to keep him neat and respectable I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. Why, do what I will, his arms are always too long for his jacket-sleeves, and his trousers half-way up his legs. If he grew stout at the same time, and more fit for his farming, like Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been used to seeDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A IIEX S XEST. 9 my brothers grow down in Lincolnshire, well and good : but instead of that, heâ\\x80\\x99s as slim oâ\\x80\\x99 J as a young fir-tree ; and the farmers give him less wages than the others, because he canâ\\x80\\x99t get through so much work. But there ! it D C is no use talking about it. One must take oneâ\\x80\\x99s children as God Almighty sends them, and be thankful theyâ\\x80\\x99re no worse. For with all his cranks, Billâ\\x80\\x99s a good son to me, and youâ\\x80\\x99re a good girl, too, Bessie,â\\x80\\x99 she went on, â\\x80\\x98 though youâ\\x80\\x99re obstinate about the washing. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve often told you that you and I together might take in double the washing, and make twice the money. But itâ\\x80\\x99s no use talk 172 ing.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But think when Iâ\\x80\\x99m an infant-school- mistress, mother, and making perhaps 20/. or 30/. a year ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah, well ! I daresay. But all this extra schooling comes heavy. But none of you10 TIIWABTED. take to hard work, so I must just work all the harder myself to make up for it.â\\x80\\x99 And the washerwoman bustled away into the wash-house, and was heard splashing energetically as she rinsed out the clothes. Poor thing ! Like the hen in the fable, she had hatched ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in her nest, and now she found the creatures she had expected to be little barn-door chickens, developing powers of which she knew nothing, and eager to dash into waters which she had never dared approach. In vain she stood cackling on the brink, O \" striving to recall them to the barn-door life that had ever seemed to her so all-sufficient. She could not follow them, and they would not heed her cry.CHAPTER II. THE QUIET LITTLE VILLAGE OF GRINFIELDCHAPTER II. Dinner being now ready, Bessie called her mother from the wash-house, and then went to the cottage door to see if her brother were in sight. Shading her eyes with her hand, she stood gazing down the road, till in the distance she saw him coming slowly along. â\\x80\\x98 Heâ\\x80\\x99s coming, mother â\\x80\\x99 she said, return 172 ing into the cottage ; and they began dinner. Bill came in almost immediately after. A tall, slightly-built youth of about seventeen ; in every respect as unlike oneâ\\x80\\x99s idea of a farm-labourer as could possibly be.14 THWARTED ; OR, lie had an earnest, thoughtful face ; with a tinge about it of slight melancholy. He had the same rather delicate features as his sister. Ile was very unlike his mother, except in the one point in which Bessie also re 172 sembled herâ\\x80\\x94the expression of determi 172 nation about the eyes and forehead. He took his place at the table, but hurried over his meal as if he were only going through the farce of eating because he must. Ile soon rose, and saying he had some 172 thing to finish before going back to the farm, he disappeared into the adjoining room. â\\x80\\x98Heâ\\x80\\x99s eaten nothing,â\\x80\\x99 said the widow as soon as he was gone. â\\x80\\x98 But lieâ\\x80\\x99s drunk a lot,â\\x80\\x99 said Charlie, hopefully, as he turned over Dickâ\\x80\\x99sLUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IN A HENâ\\x80\\x99S NEST. 15 * water-mug, which he had drained to the dregs. â\\x80\\x98 Heâ\\x80\\x99ll not get stout upon that,â\\x80\\x99 sighed the washerwoman, as she rose from the table, and began clearing away the things. Bessie now prepared to return to the village school for the afternoon. She was an unpaid pupil-teacher, and was hoping soon to pass the examination which would qualify lier for the post of an infant-schoolmistress. This had been her ambition from early youth, and the thought of its approaching fulfilment often made her heart beat high. She had a natural talent for teaching. O It seemed born in her. Long ago, the O O 7 schoolmistress had seen that the infants, under Bessieâ\\x80\\x99s tuition, learnt twice as fast, and with twice as much delight, as under that of any of the other teachers. She seemed able to be at once clear and16 THWARTED ; OR, * attractive in her manner of imparting in 172 struction, and to have the power of gaining the most fidgety childâ\\x80\\x99s attention. Under these circumstances her future career seemed mapped out for her, and the villa ere schoolmistress educated her for that O end. Bessie had stuck to her intention with gentle pertinacity, in spite of her motherâ\\x80\\x99s wish for her to take advantage of a vacant scullery-maidâ\\x80\\x99s place at the Big House, or her equally earnest desire that her daughter should join her in the labours of washing and clear-starching. Bessie felt that she was fitted for higher things, and also that in the end it would be more advantageous for her mother as well as for herself. She lamented, certainly, that the extra years of schooling necessary to fit her forDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A HEXâ\\x80\\x99S XEST. 17 her vocation should for the present be an extra expense to her mother ; but she hoped to pay lier back a hundredfold some day, and be the means of loading her declining years with every kind of comfort. She had always been upheld in her am 172 bition by her brother, who was proud of her talents, and could not bear the thought of their being thrown away. â\\x80\\x98 A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,â\\x80\\x99 had been the widowâ\\x80\\x99s bitter exclama 172 tion when she saw that the scullery-maidâ\\x80\\x99s place (in her eyes so rare and so valuable an opening in life) was to slip from the grasp by which she would fain have detained it. She could hardly bear with patience to see it pass away from her family ; and was not so sanguine as her children as to the distant infant-schoolmistress-ship ; not seeing13 THWARTED ; OR, who was to interest themselves sufficiently in her girl to procure her such an appoint 172 ment. The village in which the family of Tarver lived was certainly not a propitious atmosphere for the development of native talent, or one that paved the way for the rise in life of its young inhabitants. It was an isolated and somewhat neg 172 lected district. The civilising power of a local railway was as yet unknown. The nearest station was fourteen miles off, and the market town nearly ten. There were no large landed proprietorsâ\\x80\\x99 houses in the near neighbourhood. The land round about the village belonged to the â\\x80\\x98Big House,â\\x80\\x99 and so did the surrounding farms and cottages. It was altogether a behind-the-times, old- fashioned kind of place. The â\\x80\\x98 Big House,â\\x80\\x99ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 19 which by its name might lead the stranger to suppose it to be a star of the first mag 172 nitude, was only so called by comparison with the lesser lights of the village among D DO which it stood ; and was inhabited by an invalid lady and her little girl. What time this lady had in her short day (for she never rose till two) was, of course, devoted to her child. So that leaders of schemes, and promoters of progress and good works, there were none. â\\x80\\x98 Aide-toi â\\x80\\x99 was, therefore, the only motto for aspiring young spirits after this worldâ\\x80\\x99s good in the quiet little village of Grinfield. â\\x80\\x98Bill, itâ\\x80\\x99s past the quarter,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie, looking into her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s room, with her bonnet on. It was an untidy little place. Bits of wood and pieces of carving lay about in c 220 THWARTED ; OR, every direction ; and unfinished designs od stray bits of paper were scattered about on the floor. In the midst of the confusion sat Bill, with his carving on his lap, working away with a penknife, and completely absorbed in his occupation. It was a wonderfully pretty creation that was growing out of the rough wood under his hand, and Bessie gazed at it with â\\x80¢admiration. â\\x80\\x98 How you have got on with it since yesterday, Bill ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 tliÃ§ boy answered, looking up â\\x80¢excitedly, his face very unlike the quiet, thoughtful face it had been at dinner ; â\\x80\\x98 but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just got to a difficulty, Bess ; and I donâ\\x80\\x99t see how I am to get past it.â\\x80\\x99 His eyes sparkled as he spoke with a look half of determination, half of disappoint-ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 21 ment ; his head went down again, and lie hacked away fiercely. â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s no use,â\\x80\\x99 he burst out after a minute ; â\\x80\\x98 the difficulty would be nothing with proper tools ; but with this wretched knife â\\x80\\x99 and with something like a sob, he flung it to the other end of the room. â\\x80\\x98Never mind, Bill, dear,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie, softly ; â\\x80\\x98 try again to-night, when youâ\\x80\\x99re not so hurried ; you had better come now.â\\x80\\x99 But even while she spoke he had picked up the knife, and was working away as hard as ever. â\\x80\\x98 Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll walk slowly on, Bill, and perhaps youâ\\x80\\x99ll overtake me. But if by any chance you donâ\\x80\\x99t, will you come and fetch me this evening ? Itâ\\x80\\x99s my day to study with the mistress after the schoolâ\\x80\\x99s broke up, and itâ\\x80\\x99ll be dark before I get home.â\\x80\\x99 lie murmured something unintelligible,99 THWARTED. and she left him. Charlie was ready to start, and they walked on leisurely, so as to give Bill every chance of overtaking them. But when they reached the schools he was still in the far distance ; so Bessie had to give him up, for the clock struck the hour for afternoon school, and her little class was waiting. OCHAPTER III. THE BROTHER AND SISTERâ\\x80\\x99S WALK HOME.CHAPTER III. About two hours after, Bessie came out of the school, and found Bill walking up and down waiting for her. The brother and sister walked along the road for some time in silence. At last Bessie saidâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 Whatâ\\x80\\x99s made you so thoughtful all day to-day, Bill? Is there anything particular youâ\\x80\\x99ve been thinking about ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes ! â\\x80\\x99 he answered so vehemently that he quite startled her ; â\\x80\\x98 thinking what a wretched thing it is to live in a little out-of- the-way hole like this place, where thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing ever doing or stirring ; and where26 THWARTED ; OR, nobody does anything to help a poor man to improve himself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Whatâ\\x80\\x99s put it more particularly into your thoughts to-day, Bill P â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Beading this, for one thing,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, pulling a magazine out of his pocket, â\\x80\\x98 and seeing how different it all is in other places.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And the other thing P â\\x80\\x99 questioned Bessie. â\\x80\\x98 What I saw up at the Big House last night,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, turning his face eagerly towards her. â\\x80\\x98 What was that, Bill ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 A beautiful tool-box, Bess, just come down from London. The footman asked me to help him to unpack it. You never saw anything half so delightful. Every sort of delicious tool to make a difficulty easier than no difficulty with a penknife. A saw, a chisel, a gimlet, etc., etc.â\\x80\\x99ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a iienâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 27 Bessie could hardly follow the excited enumeration, but she watched the gusto with which the boy pronounced the name of every tool. â\\x80\\x98 And what were you reading in the magazine, Bill ? â\\x80\\x99 He handed it to her, and she glanced over the article he indicated. The subject was the progress of art in England during the last twenty or thirty years ; and the discovery and development of talent of all kinds among all classes. There was a list of institutions established Avhere struggling artists, whose talents would otherwise have run to waste, can now have the best instruction for next to nothing. Amongst other advantages held out for improving the taste of the public was men 172 tioned the opening of exhibitions, where all the great people of England sent the works28 THWARTED ; OR, of the old masters that had been handed down in their families from generation to generation, so that all might see and profit- by them. Having read thus far, Bessie looked up and said, â\\x80\\x98Well, but, Bill, there is nothing to complain of in this. What more would you have? This goes to prove that the poor in these days have quite as many advantages as the rich. Artists learn in London, you see, for next to nothing.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Do we live in London ? â\\x80\\x99 he retorted. â\\x80\\x98 That is just what I complain of.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well, no,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie, slowly ; â\\x80\\x98 but still. â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But still,â\\x80\\x99 he said impatiently, â\\x80\\x98 but still we live in this little out-of-the-way behind- the-times Grinfield, while in London every advantage is offered free. I am nearly seventeen ; I would work day and night atducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 29 carving willingly and gladly, and I know I could turn it to account ; and for want of instruction and opportunity, I am doomed to work all my life long in a farm-yard, becqjiise I should starve if I didnâ\\x80\\x99t. Oh, Bessie ! I am sorely tempted sometimes to start off, like Dick Whittington, and find my way to London. Once there, I should succeed, I know.â\\x80\\x99 Bessie looked rather frightened. â\\x80\\x98Well, read on,â\\x80\\x99he said, relapsing into his usual quiet manner; â\\x80\\x98you havenâ\\x80\\x99t got beyond London yet. If it was only London, I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t mind so much, for I should feel I was no worse off than any other country lad. But see what it says after.â\\x80\\x99 The article went on to say how the march of enlightenment had spread into country towns, hamlets, villages, colliery districts, and all over the land.30 THWARTED ; OR, Institutions 011 a smaller scale were enumerated, which had served to draw out local talents, as well as to foster and en 172 courage general improvement. First on the list came Village Industrial Exhibitions. Then followed book clubs, evening lectures in parish schools, penny readings, agricultural shows, flower shows, etc., etc. Examples were given of men and boys who, by means of the first institution, had been found to possess tastes and talents hitherto unsuspected, and had been sent up to London to profit by the advantages there. One example there was, and that the last one, of a youth who had for years employed all his leisure time in carving; who, by means of an industrial exhibition in the neighbourhood, had had his talents brought under the notice of a gentleman, who hadducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. interested himself to procure the boy a situation in a sreat furniture warehouse in O London, at a rate of wages sufficient to support him entirely at the time, with a hope of steady increase in the future. At this point Bessie saw her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s eye fixed upon her with such a hungry expression, that she could hardly help laughing. She restrained herself, however, and said, as she gave him back the magazine, â\\x80\\x98 I wish something of the sort would happen to you, dear Bill ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But it never will,â\\x80\\x99 he answered bitterly. â\\x80\\x98 I shall live and die a farm-labourer in this wretched little place.â\\x80\\x99 They walked on a little way in silence, and then Bill broke out again : â\\x80\\x98 Why, not one of the things that article speaks of as common to every little country village is even known here. I donâ\\x80\\x99t mean the granderTHWARTED ; OR, things, but such simple things as book clubs and night schools. We donâ\\x80\\x99t even have a flower show ! I canâ\\x80\\x99t think, Bessie, how mother ever came to settle here. Of all places in the world to .choose ! She must have had all England to choose from when my father died ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I wonder where we lived before,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie, meditatively. â\\x80\\x98 I shall ask mother this very night,â\\x80\\x99 ex 172 claimed Bill. Bessie shook her head. â\\x80\\x98 Better not, Bill ; you know how she hates being questioned. It seems as if she couldnâ\\x80\\x99t bear being asked anything about her former life. Besides, itâ\\x80\\x99s no good, for she wonâ\\x80\\x99t answer. â\\x80\\x98 But Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure she has any right to hide everything about my father from us,â\\x80\\x99 said Bill. â\\x80\\x98 We are not babies now, and ifducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A iiexâ\\x80\\x99s xest. thereâ\\x80\\x99s any secret, we ought to know it. / ought, at any rate. Why, I donâ\\x80\\x99t even know what he was, or where he lived, or anything about him. I think itâ\\x80\\x99s rather hard upon me. It makes me think I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s not with shame she mentions his name when she does speak of him. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s great trouble and sorrow con 172 nected with him ; but nothing but that, Bill, you may depend upon it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well then, I say itâ\\x80\\x99s wrong to keep one so much in the dark as to leave room for such horrible suspicions,â\\x80\\x99 said Bill ; â\\x80\\x98 and I34 THWARTED ; OR, shall tell mother thatâ\\x80\\x99s what the result of lier being so mysterious has been.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ko, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t, Bill.

The meal was soon over, and cleared away. Bessie got out her work, and the widow began to darn Billâ\\x80\\x99s socks. The fire crackled merrily, and for a time ; all three were silent.CHAPTER IV.

Why weâ\\x80\\x99ve always lived here.â\\x80\\x99 Â£ Not always, mother.

Where was it, mother ? \\' The direct question seemed to deprive the widow of the powers of evasion she had always hitherto so successfully practised, whenever her children had touched oii these forbidden topics. Bill, too, was so much bolder and more determined than usual, and she answered, almost as if she could not help herself, â\\x80\\x98 In London.â\\x80\\x99 But she was not prepared for the effect her answer would have upon her son.ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs ix a hexâ\\x80\\x99s xest. 41 â\\x80\\x98 In London ! â\\x80\\x99 lie exclaimed, springing to his feet, and crimsoning with excitement ; â\\x80\\x98 Oh Bessie ! Bessie ! do you hear that ? In London !â\\x80\\x99 Bessie felt for him sincerely, as he stood there hushed and breathless. She knew well the thoughts that were racing through his brain of all that life in London might have clone for him : of all the advantages to be found there, that he had that very afternoon enumerated. But she felt also for her mother, who had dropped her work, and was looking at him with a half-scared look, as if asking the reason of this sudden outburst. â\\x80\\x98 Bless me, Bill,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed the widow, â\\x80\\x98 are you gone crazy ? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter with you ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It makes me crazy to think of it,â\\x80\\x99 he cried ; â\\x80\\x98 to have lived in London, and to have42 THWARTED ; OR, left it !

London indeed ! So thatâ\\x80\\x99s your idea of good fortune and happiness is it ! London ! A place overcrowded and overstocked with workers, treading on each othersâ\\x80\\x99 heels, and not work to be found for the half of them ! Oh my God ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed suddenly, dropping her work and covering lier face with her hands, â\\x80\\x98 how wretched I have been in London ! â\\x80\\x99 Bessie glanced imploringly at her brother, and signed to him to stop the conversation. Bill drew near to his mother, touched by the sight of her distress.ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 43 â\\x80\\x98 Little Mother,â\\x80\\x99 he said coaxingly, stroking her work-worn hands, â\\x80\\x98 wonâ\\x80\\x99t you tell us what made you sad in those old days ? Wonâ\\x80\\x99t you at last tell us something about our father, and our early life ? â\\x80\\x99 His words and manner seemed to stir her strangely. The tears came into her eyes. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ll not have you call me that, William,â\\x80\\x99 she said very softly, and her voice seemed to dwell fondly and with a peculiar intonation on the liquid sounds that make up the name. â\\x80\\x98 Why ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Bessie gently ; â\\x80\\x98 did my father call you so ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said the widow, as she dashed away a tear ; â\\x80\\x98 but itâ\\x80\\x99s long ago, children, oh ! itâ\\x80\\x99s very long ago.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I was very young to be married, and when you were born, Bessie, your father44 THWARTED ; OR, used to laugh to see me with you, because I looked, he said, like a child playing with its doll.

Her husband was alive then, and he was related to a lady living near Bournby ; so thatâ\\x80\\x99s how I heard of the place. But I didnâ\\x80\\x99t stay long, for I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t bear being parted from all of you. So, when the village laundress died, I set up for myself in this little cottage, and sent for you children here. And here weâ\\x80\\x99ve lived ever since, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve often thanked God for the quiet untroubled life weâ\\x80\\x99ve led.

Donâ\\x80\\x99t bother me with any more questions.â\\x80\\x99 There was evidently nothing more to be got out of her ; and the subject would have dropped then and there if Bill had not heaved a deep sigh and said half to himself, â\\x80\\x98 Well ! I wish weâ\\x80\\x99d settled anywhere else. If not London, then not in England at all, but in Germany.â\\x80\\x99 The widow looked up sharply. â\\x80\\x98 Germany ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98 what on earth put such an idea into your head ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Something Iâ\\x80\\x99ve read here,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, producing his magazine : â\\x80\\x98 Germanyâ\\x80\\x99s the place in these days, depend upon it.

Why, the improvement in England in these respects in the last twenty years is all due to the Germans.

It says here too, that all over England,in Worcestershire,Lincolnshire,48 THWARTED ; OR, and all the counties round about, there have been Industrial Exhibitions and the like, which have roused the men and boys of the villages to give their leisure hours to carving, painting on wood, drawing, and carpentering, with such good results that many of them have been admitted into the Worcester china works, or sent to carving establishments in London.

Believe me when I tell you a hard-working unambitious life is the safest and the happiest. All the rest is struggle and disappointment. It wears out heart and life, and gives nothing in exchange.

Bill ! youâ\\x80\\x99re not going to throw up your place ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, no,â\\x80\\x99 he said soothingly ; â\\x80\\x98 donâ\\x80\\x99t you be afraid, mother dear. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not going to do anything foolish. Iâ\\x80\\x99m only going to wait, till, as I say, I see a way out of it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If there is a way,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie softly, â\\x80\\x98 God will show it.â\\x80\\x99 There was silence for a minute after this, till the widow burst out again. â\\x80\\x98 Thankducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 51 God Iâ\\x80\\x99ve no talents to make me discontented with my lot.

The next morning, Bill left home earlier than usual, as he Jiad to take some clean clothes to the Big House before going to his work at the farm. With his thoughts dwelling on the usual subject, he walked along quickly, the basket on his arm. Arrived at the back 172 door of the Big House, he was about to de 172 posit his burden and proceed on his way, when the housemaid asked him to wait a minute, as she believed there was a message to go back to Airs. Tarver. She further requested him to carry the basket to the foot of the bedroom staircase ;58 THWARTED ; OR, and then, pushing open a door in the passage, she said, â\\x80\\x98 If you will wait in the little library, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go up and enquire about it ; I may be a few minutes, as if the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s- maid is in Mrs. Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s room, I shanâ\\x80\\x99t be able to speak to her. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nobody in the library. Missus wonâ\\x80\\x99t be down for hours.â\\x80\\x99 * Bill assented to her request, and walked into the room. He found himself in a comfortable little apartment, evidently dedicated entirely to the invalid lady. There was a couch by the fire, to which was fitted an invalid table and reading- desk. There were books, work, drawing- materials, and paint-boxes on different tables in the room ; and Bill sighed as he thought what a highly-gifted creature Mrs. HerbertDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A HENâ\\x80\\x99S NEST. 59 must be, and how fortunate in thus possess 172 ing every advantage wherewith to cultivate her tastes. He looked in vain, however, for any sign of that delicious tool-box which was so often uppermost in his thoughts. He wandered about the room, looking at the china, the pictures, and other things in the room, till he came upon a little table in the window, on which stood a large wooden box. When his eyes fell upon this box lie started, and clasped his hands together. His eyes glowed and sparkled, and with a half-uttered exclamation of delight, he advanced nearer and nearer, and bending- over it, stood motionless. For its lid was most beautifully and wonderfully carved : a real work of art. For full ten minutes he remained as ifCO THWARTED ; OR, under a spell, gazing with wonder at the beauty of the detail, and the delicacy of the workmanship. And as he - drank it in, his heart swelled with the same feelings, half of pride and half of humility, that drew from another kind of artist the triumphant exclamation, â\\x80\\x98 And I, too, am a painter ! â\\x80\\x99 It is true his heart sank within him at the thought of his own inferiority ; and at the recollection of his own poor little attempts at home. But with all that, arose a proud feeling in his breast that his foot was upon the same ladder, albeit it were the very lowest step, to the top of which the originator of such a conception had climbed ; that his face was set towards the same goal that another had so triumphantly reached ; and that his own work and the realisation of all his dreams,DUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A IIENS NEST. Gl that he saw before him, had been accom 172 plished by kindred means. Ilis mind soared away into fields of infinite possibilities. â\\x80\\x98 What man has done, man may do,â\\x80\\x99 he exclaimed almost aloud, and he drew a long breath of inspiration. â\\x80\\x98 Why ! youâ\\x80\\x99re talking to yourself,â\\x80\\x99 said a soft, very silvery voice close to him. Bill started, and turned round. So far away were his thoughts that he had difficulty in remembering where he was, or what had brought him hither, and was so dazed and bewildered that he could not speak. At first he saw nothing ; but he found he had not looked low enough. Casting his eyes down, they lighted on a tiny creature, with a shower of wild fair hair, from out of which a pair of laughing eyes were gazing in astonishment at him. O OG2 THWARTED ; OR, Bill, still half dreaming, had difficulty in persuading himself that this was not some diminutive Queen of art and beauty come to ask him by what right he had made this encroachment 011 her dominions. The trim, upright, little figure, the sym 172 metry of the little black silk legs, the colour 172 ing of the garments that harmonised so well with the bright hair ; seemed to him, for a moment, only another form of art, only another example of the perfection of lines and curves, and harmony of detail, of which his mind was full. An instantâ\\x80\\x99s reflection, however, told him that it was only Mrs. Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s little girl. He knew her well enough by sight ; as he had often seen her in church, or passed her in the lanes on her pony, or walking with her nurse ; but he had never spoken to her before.ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s NEST. Go Blushing deeply, he took off his cap, and stammered out an apology. â\\x80\\x98What were you doing?â\\x80\\x99 laughed .the child. â\\x80\\x98 You were staring so at something that you didnâ\\x80\\x99t even look round when I came in !

Bill stooped. â\\x80\\x98 Lower ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed; â\\x80\\x98 you donâ\\x80\\x99t seem to get a bit nearer, though Iâ\\x80\\x99m standing on tip-toe. You are so very, very tall.â\\x80\\x99 Bill bent lower and lower, but still to no purpose. â\\x80\\x98 Perhaps youâ\\x80\\x99d better kneel,â\\x80\\x99 she said at last ; â\\x80\\x98 and then I shall just about reach your ear.â\\x80\\x99 Bill obeyed ; and raising herself on the very tips of her toes, the child said in an awe 172 struck whisper,ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest.

I dream of them at night afterwards,â\\x80\\x99 she added, with a little shudder, â\\x80\\x98 reeling about, and tumbling down : and it is so dreadful. Do you ever dream that a drunken man is reeling after you, and that your feet are tied to the ground, and you canâ\\x80\\x99t get away ? â\\x80\\x99 Billâ\\x80\\x99s memory was not able to furnish him with the recollection of any such pain 172 ful experience.

He never can think why I want to gallop off when I see one coming along.â\\x80\\x99 o o â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m not afraid of them, Miss,â\\x80\\x99 Bill answered, â\\x80\\x98 but I hate meeting them quite as much [as\\' you do. To see a man making himself like an animal is a dreadful sight, I think.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You think a tipsy man looks like an animal then,â\\x80\\x99 she said, as if struck by the idea. â\\x80\\x98 Indeed I do,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, sadly. â\\x80\\x98 What kind of animal,â\\x80\\x99 she questioned, â\\x80\\x98 should you say a man looked most likeDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A IIEXâ\\x80\\x99s KEST. 67 when heâ\\x80\\x99s . . . ? â\\x80\\x99 she nodded again in a mysterious way, as if she did not like saying the word. â\\x80\\x98 I hardly know,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, while his brow darkened. â\\x80\\x98 A pig ? â\\x80\\x99 she suggested, putting her hands behind her, and looking up in his face. â\\x80\\x98 Yes, or an ass,â\\x80\\x99 he said ; but he was speaking more to himself than to her. â\\x80\\x98 Youâ\\x80\\x99re getting quite angry about it, ainâ\\x80\\x99t you P â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98It makes me angry,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, for 172 getting he was speaking to a child, â\\x80\\x98 to see men wasting their time, and going to the public house, just because theyâ\\x80\\x99ve got nothing else to do in their leisure hours.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Is that why they do it ? â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98 Of course it is,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, warming with his subject, as his grievances about F 268 THWARTED ; OR, Grinfiekl recurred to him ; â\\x80\\x98 there\\'s nothing for a man to do in this Avretched little village hut go to the public house. Why, I should * think,â\\x80\\x99 he A\\\\ r ent on, making a bold plunge into statistics, 4 thereâ\\x80\\x99s more drunkenness in this village of Grinfiekl than in almost any other place ! â\\x80\\x99 The childâ\\x80\\x99s face lengthened consider 172 ably. 4 In proportion, you know,â\\x80\\x99 Till added. 4 In Proportion,â\\x80\\x99 she repeated ; 4 whereâ\\x80\\x99s that ? Is it the name of this county ? â\\x80\\x99 4 No,â\\x80\\x99 said Bill, smiling ; 4 this county is Yorkshire. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you know that ? â\\x80\\x99 4 1 donâ\\x80\\x99t know my counties well,â\\x80\\x99 she said, rather shyly. 4 Iâ\\x80\\x99m not very far on in geography. You see mammyâ\\x80\\x99s too ill to teach me much, and, besides, I hate lessons.â\\x80\\x99 4 You ought to go to the infant school, and hear my sister teaching the little childrenducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a iienâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 69 there,â\\x80\\x99 said Bill ; â\\x80\\x98 they like their lessons, and they do lots of geography.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Would they know where Proportion is ? â\\x80\\x99 she asked, timidly. Bill smiled. â\\x80\\x98 Proportionâ\\x80\\x99s not a place, Miss : itâ\\x80\\x99s a word.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What does it mean ? â\\x80\\x99 was the next question. Bill looked down from his live foot eleven elevation, to the tiny creature below, who hardly reached his hand, and felt the impossibility of an explanation. â\\x80\\x98 Pm afraid I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell you, Miss.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Is it such a very bad word ? â\\x80\\x99 she en 172 quired, looking very solemn. â\\x80\\x98 No,â\\x80\\x99 laughed Bill ; â\\x80\\x98 itâ\\x80\\x99s only difficult for such a little lady as you to under 172 stand.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I see you think me a dunce,â\\x80\\x99 she said half-pathetically, half-peevishly, â\\x80\\x98 and much70 THWARTED ; OR, more stupider than the children at the infant school. You want me to go and see how much more they know than I do. Itâ\\x80\\x99s very unkind of yon ! â\\x80\\x99 Bill was unaware how seldom the petted child was contradicted, or in any way found fault with ; and was surprised at her sudden change of tone. Â£ Oh dear me ! no ! Miss ; I didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean that at all. I only thought it would amuse you to hear them doing their lessons. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s all.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah well,â\\x80\\x99 she said, mollified in a moment, â\\x80\\x98 itâ\\x80\\x99s just what would amuse me very much, but mammy never will let me go. She always says â\\x80\\x9c youâ\\x80\\x99ll catch something â\\x80\\x9d whenever I want to go anywhere. It is so tiresome.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing to catch just now,â\\x80\\x99 said Bill. â\\x80\\x98 My sister always knows if any of theducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 71 children are ill ; but thereâ\\x80\\x99s been no illness at all this winter. You might\\'go there quite safely.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it funny ? â\\x80\\x99 said the child, in an aggrieved voice ; â\\x80\\x98 mammyâ\\x80\\x99s always expect 172 ing me to be ill, and yet I never am ill ! I do wish,â\\x80\\x99 with a deep-drawn sigh, â\\x80\\x98 sheâ\\x80\\x99d give up expecting it.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 You canâ\\x80\\x99t wonder she should be nervous about you, Miss,â\\x80\\x99 said Bill gravely, â\\x80\\x98 when sheâ\\x80\\x99s lost so many children.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 They werenâ\\x80\\x99t lost,\\' exclaimed the child 4 they died. They got ill, and then worse and worse, and then they died. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re all dead but me. ij â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose you remember them, Miss ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, no ! Sometimes I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe I ever had any brothers and sisters. All I know about them is their little graves in the72 THWARTED ; OR, churchyard. I go and sit there sometimes for fun . . . oil, no ! â\\x80\\x99 she broke off, noticing Billâ\\x80\\x99s shocked expression, â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t mean for fun exactly ; but to amuse myself. At least . . . well ! I go there,â\\x80\\x99 she said, in a plaintive voice, â\\x80\\x98 when Iâ\\x80\\x99m all alone, and have got nothing to do : when mammyâ\\x80\\x99s too ill to have me, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m so dull all alone, donâ\\x80\\x99t you see ? â\\x80\\x99 Bill assented hurriedly, afraid she was going to cry. â\\x80\\x98 But I shall come to the infant school now instead, the very next time Iâ\\x80\\x99m dull,â\\x80\\x99 she proclaimed. â\\x80\\x98 I thought you said Mrs. Herbert would not let you,â\\x80\\x99 said Bill, a little nervously. â\\x80\\x98 Why, youâ\\x80\\x99ve just asked me to come ! â\\x80\\x99 she retorted. â\\x80\\x98 Didnâ\\x80\\x99t you say yourself I ought to hear your sister teaching the children, and that you knew they had gotducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 73 nothing I could catch ! I shall tell mammy you said I might.â\\x80\\x99 Bill felt very uncomfortable, and won 172 dered what he had better say. But be 172 fore he had made up his mind, she began again : â\\x80\\x98 Well ! now go on with what we were talking of before.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I said,â\\x80\\x99 returned Bill, glad to change the subject, â\\x80\\x98 that I believed there was more drunkenness in this little village of Grinfield than in almost any other place, in pro 172 per .... in England.â\\x80\\x99 1 And is that really true ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, looking horrified. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid so,â\\x80\\x99 said Bill, sadly. â\\x80\\x98 If I were the Queen of England,â\\x80\\x99 said the child, stamping her little foot upon the ground, â\\x80\\x98 I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have any public houses anywhere. Iâ\\x80\\x99d burn them all, and not74 THWARTED ; OR, allow any new ones to be built up. Then nobody could go to them, and get tipsy.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 It would be no use,â\\x80\\x99 replied Bill, regard 172 less of the youth of his auditor, noiv that he was fairly launched on his favourite topic ; â\\x80\\x98 if a man will drink, he will. If there were no public houses to go to, heâ\\x80\\x99d get the beer or the spirits, or whatever it is, some other way, and drink it at home, or by the road 172 side, or anywhere. It would come to the same thing in the end. That\\'s not whatâ\\x80\\x99s wanted. Men ought to learn to use a thing, without abusing it. It ought not to be necessary to treat them like children, to take a thing altogether away, because they make a bad use of it. We donâ\\x80\\x99t want to have a temptation removed, but to learn to resist it. It only wants a little strength and courage. Besides, itâ\\x80\\x99s not always the love of drink that takes men to the public house. As often asducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a hen\\'s nest. 75 not, itâ\\x80\\x99s the want of something else to do. Itâ\\x80\\x99s that that drives our Grinfield men there. And thereâ\\x80\\x99s more excuse for them than there is for most. Grinfieldâ\\x80\\x99s not like other places, where thereâ\\x80\\x99s occupation and amuse 172 ment provided for a working-man in his leisure hours. Here, no one takes the trouble to do anything for him. There are no book clubs or lending libraries to give him a chance of improving his mind, no night schools, no penny readings, nothing ! Thereâ\\x80\\x99s not even recreation and amusement. Hot a flower-show to encourage him to cultivate his garden, or a cricket-club, or anything of the kind. Hot a single induce 172 ment is offered him to prevent his hanging about the public house all day, when heâ\\x80\\x99s not at work. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing on earth for him to do else. And itâ\\x80\\x99s a crying shame, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what it is ! â\\x80\\x9976 THWARTED ; OR, â\\x80\\x98 Are you scolding me P â\\x80\\x99 interrupted the child ; â\\x80\\x98 you do seem so very angry ! â\\x80\\x99 Bill stopped short. The little creature was gazing at him, bewildered and frightened. She had striven to follow him at first, for there was a fascina 172 tion in being talked to as a grown-up person ; but he had got far beyond her ; and had only created a vague feeling in her little mind that somebody had done something very wrong, and that some others had omitted to do something which it was clear they ought to do. â\\x80\\x98 I beg your pardon, Miss,â\\x80\\x99 said Bill ; â\\x80\\x98 I was only wishing to explain to you that it is not altogether the menâ\\x80\\x99s fault that thereâ\\x80\\x99s so much drunkenness here ; but that some of the blame lies with those who do nothing to better the working-manâ\\x80\\x99s condition.â\\x80\\x99 He had forgotten that he was speaking to Mrs.ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a iienâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 77 Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, and that his implied reproach was addressed to the child of the only wealthy resident in the place. But it flashed across him now, as he looked at the little lady before him, and he began to fear that some kind of light was beginning to O O O dawn in her small mind too. For she still stood silent, looking very puzzled. Hot that there was anything of fear of consequences in the young manâ\\x80\\x99s breast ; but that in his deeply-rooted love and respect for his own mother, he would not for worlds bring a doubt across the little girlâ\\x80\\x99s mind about hers ; or shake that faith in a motherâ\\x80\\x99s goodness which is the birthright of every little child. She showed a pertinacious desire to pursue the subject, which troubled him not a little.78 THWARTED ; OR, â\\x80\\x98 Who are these naughty people P â\\x80\\x99 she said, eyeing Bill doubtfully ; â\\x80\\x98 what are their names ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 There is nobody exactly to do anything,â\\x80\\x99 was his evasive answer. â\\x80\\x98 Old Mr. Powell, the parson, is too old, and the rest mostly too poor. And . . .â\\x80\\x99 he added hurriedly, â\\x80\\x98 Mrs. Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s too ill . . . and you are too young. But,â\\x80\\x99 he went on more boldly, â\\x80\\x98 youâ\\x80\\x99ll be older some day, Miss, and when youâ\\x80\\x99re a grown-up young lady, youâ\\x80\\x99ll do a great deal, I dare 172 say.â\\x80\\x99 He had succeeded, at any rate, in dis 172 tracting her thoughts ; for a delighted smile broke over her face at the idea of being grown-up. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be eight on Midsummer Hay ! â\\x80\\x99 she said ; â\\x80\\x98 so in ten years I shall be going to be eighteen. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s quite grown 172 up, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it ? â\\x80\\x99ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 79 1 Quite ! â\\x80\\x99 he answered ; 4 itâ\\x80\\x99s a little older than I am now.â\\x80\\x99 The child measured his height with her eye as he stood before her, with proud satis 172 faction, and sighed with pleasure at the thought. 4 A trailing gown ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, clasp 172 ing her hands ; 4 no lessons, and hair done up like mammyâ\\x80\\x99s ! â\\x80\\x99 Child-like, she had forgotten the present in the future, and was lost in a dream of delight. And youth, which is only one step be 172 yond childhood, made the young man do likewise ; and his thoughts had wandered on to all that those ten years might bring : to all that he might by that time have accomplished. Tor a few minutes neither spoke. The volatile child was the first to tire of80 THWARTED ; OR, meditation ; and she tried to recur to the con 172 versation. Her little mind, however, could not pick it up again from the starting-point she desired : and she got back to the old sub 172 ject. â\\x80\\x98 So you drink nothing but water ? â\\x80\\x99 she said, looking at him admiringly ; â\\x80\\x98 no more do I.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I drink beer sometimes,â\\x80\\x99 he answered ; â\\x80\\x98 a proper quantity is good and necessary for a man who works hard. But I donâ\\x80\\x99t care about it much. My mother would be glad if I drank a little more ; she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t care to see me drink so much water.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I suppose,â\\x80\\x99 said the child meditatively, â\\x80\\x98 thereâ\\x80\\x99s so much water wanted in your house, that sheâ\\x80\\x99d almost rather you drank beer.â\\x80\\x99 Then seeing Bill looked puzzled, she added :ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 81 â\\x80\\x98 I was thinking of the washing, you know.â\\x80\\x99 Bill smiled. â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! thereâ\\x80\\x99s enough, and to spare. She thinks I should get stronger on beer, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all.â\\x80\\x99 A deep sigh of intense interest, and then she said : â\\x80\\x98 But all this time youâ\\x80\\x99ve never told me what you were looking at when I came in. Why you never even looked round at me ! â\\x80\\x99 4 1 was looking at that box,â\\x80\\x99 he answered ; 4 can you tell me anything about it ? â\\x80\\x99 4 No ! â\\x80\\x99 she said, 4 except that Iâ\\x80\\x99m very fond of looking at it too.â\\x80\\x99 Bill started ; could this tiny child be a kindred spirit ? 4 You like looking at it,â\\x80\\x99 he exclaimed eagerly ; 4 do you carve ? â\\x80\\x99 4 Yes, a little ; but not so well as Mrs. Hitchin. She carves beautifully.â\\x80\\x9982 THWARTED ; OR, â\\x80\\x98 And who is Mrs. Hitchin ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Sheâ\\x80\\x99s mammyâ\\x80\\x99s maid,â\\x80\\x99 answered the little girl. â\\x80\\x98 And what does she carve ? â\\x80\\x99 enquired Bill. â\\x80\\x98 Chickens,â\\x80\\x99 the child answered, â\\x80\\x98 or rabbits, or whatever mammy has for her dinner. I can only carve just a very little : a tiny slice off the breast, you know, or something like that. When it comes to a leg, or a wing, I have to give it up to Hitchin. But ! you donâ\\x80\\x99t seem to be listening to me a bit ! â\\x80\\x99 Bill sighed, and tried to shake off the feeling of disappointment that had come over him. â\\x80\\x98 Mrs. Herbert carves though, I am sure,â\\x80\\x99 he said, with a sudden recollection of the box he had seen. â\\x80\\x98 Oh poor mammy ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed the child, â\\x80\\x98her wristâ\\x80\\x99s not even as strong as mine.ducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A hexâ\\x80\\x99s xest. 83 She canâ\\x80\\x99t even carve a boiled chicken, which you know comes to pieces with a spoon. The only thing she can carve,â\\x80\\x99 she added in a tone of lofty disdain, â\\x80\\x98 is a little photo 172 graph-frame, or a paper-knife, or something of that sort. Youâ\\x80\\x99re listening much more than you were just now.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Hasnâ\\x80\\x99t she got a most beautiful box of tools ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Bill, stepping forward in his excitement. â\\x80\\x98Yes ! Sheâ\\x80\\x99s got a new one just come down from London ; but sheâ\\x80\\x99s never used it yet. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s been busy over some new kind of work lately. She doesnâ\\x80\\x99t often do the same thing two days running. She gets so tired of everything.â\\x80\\x99 Bill turned away. The idea of the wasted advantages for which he was crav 172 ing made him feel bitter. â\\x80\\x98 Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the good of being rich ? â\\x80\\x99 he G 284 THWASTED ; OR, muttered ; â\\x80\\x98 whatâ\\x80\\x99s the good of having advantages ? Oh what waste ! wdiat waste ! â\\x80\\x99 The childâ\\x80\\x99s merry voice recalled him to himself. â\\x80\\x98 The inside of the carved box is much prettier than the out ! â\\x80\\x99 she laughed, nodding her head. â\\x80\\x98 Is it really ? â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Bill. â\\x80\\x98 Yes ! â\\x80\\x99 she said, and there was a merry twinkle in her eye ; â\\x80\\x98 would you like to see it?â\\x80\\x99 As she spoke, she advanced on tip-toe towards the table, and put one little hand upon the box, while with the other she beckoned to him to follow her. His first feeling about her returned as he watched her. She looked so fairy-like as she stood there, and so much in harmony with theDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A IIENâ\\x80\\x99s NEST. 85 beautiful work of art 011 which her hand was laid.

Why ! how greedy you are to want such a lot ! Wasnâ\\x80\\x99t it a nice surprise ? Take one. What do you like ?

But Iâ\\x80\\x99ll soon wipe it off.â\\x80\\x99 And suiting the action to the word, she rubbed it two or three times on her frock, and then held it out again, saying, â\\x80\\x98 There ! Now itâ\\x80\\x99s clean ! â\\x80\\x99 This time Bill felt he could not refuse ; and as he met the candid unconscious eyes, he felt it equally impossible to explainâ\\x80\\x99 why he had refused it before. â\\x80\\x98 Youâ\\x80\\x99re very very particâ\\x80\\x99lar, ainâ\\x80\\x99t you? â\\x80\\x99 she said, as he silently took her little hand in his.

Slowly he drank it in. Moment by moment it became more familiar to him, bit by bit it sank into his mind. All unknown to him, it stamped itself upon his brain with an impress that nothing hereafter would altogether efface ! To his credit, however, be it spoken, that though to the last, as he left the room, his hungry eye rested on it, he did, ere he closed the door, take one farewell look at the fairy form, which, with all its hopeless alliance to the trivial, the frivolous, and the commonplace, must yet always be associated in his mind with his first glimpse of real art. For eyes should not be dead to the beautyducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 91 of nature, that are so alive to the beauty of art. And the child made such a pretty picture, standing there, watching him go. Her great eyes looked so puzzled and wistful, peeping out from her wild fair hair. The indifference he manifested was so strange and so novel to the petted only child. It troubled her light spirit for a moment, and she turned towards the window with a sigh. Putting her little elbows on the table, and resting her chin upon her hands, she gazed thoughtfully down upon the bon-bons. â\\x80\\x98 I suppose,â\\x80\\x99 she said, after a minute or two, as she helped herself to a cliocolate-cream, taking care this time not to soil her cuff in92 THWARTED. diving into the recesses of the box, â\\x80\\x98 I suppose itâ\\x80\\x99s being accustomed to see so much wash 172 ing, and so many clean clothes, that makes him so very very particâ\\x80\\x99lar ! â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER VI. THE LETTER FROM BOURNBY.CHAPTER Y I. Dinner was getting ready at the little cottage : but Bill had not returned. Bessie and Charlie had come home from the schools for good, as it was the Saturday half-holiday ; and the widow was busily ironing a few clothes that yet remained to be sent up to the Big House. â\\x80\\x98 The Postman ! â\\x80\\x99 said Charlie, jumping up from his game with the cat, and running to the door ; â\\x80\\x98 a letter for you, mother, and the post mark is Bournby.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah well, give it to Bessie,â\\x80\\x99 said the widow ; â\\x80\\x98 she must read it to me, for I havenâ\\x80\\x99t time to stop.

Her quick eye, travelling on as she read, took in what was coming before she arrived at it, and her face was beginning to flush, and her voice was getting unsteady. â\\x80\\x98 What everâ\\x80\\x99s the matter, child ? â\\x80\\x99 en 172 quired her mother, looking round. â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! mother, just listen ! â\\x80\\x99 said the girl. â\\x80\\x98 Oh ! doesnâ\\x80\\x99t it seem wonderful after our talk last night ? Didnâ\\x80\\x99t I say God would show Bill a way, if he only waited for it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Why donâ\\x80\\x99t you read the letter instead of talking?â\\x80\\x99 said her mother, sharply. Dim suspicions were beginning to creep over her, and her growing irritation betrayed itself in her tone. Bessie went on eagerly : â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x9c This grand affair is coming off in April, and itâ\\x80\\x99s whatâ\\x80\\x99s called an Industrial Exhibition.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x99 H98 THWARTED ; OR, Bessie dropped the letter, and looked up with sparkling eyes : â\\x80\\x98 Oh Mother ! Mother ! doesnâ\\x80\\x99t it seem almost like a miracle ? â\\x80\\x99 But the widow ironed away in ominous silence. Bessie waited and waited for an answer, but none came. She had been so overwhelmed with joy for Billâ\\x80\\x99s sake, that she had forgotten her mother might take another view of the subject : but now she began to feel a little uneasy. She contrived to take a sidelong view of her motherâ\\x80\\x99s face, and saw she had been right in her surmise. The face ex 172 pressed nothing but unqualified disapproval, mingled with an expression of resolution that Bessie did not like to see. She got up, and went nearer to her. â\\x80\\x98 You don\\'t like this, mother? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Am I likely to like it ? â\\x80\\x99 said the -widowDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A henâ\\x80\\x99s NEST. 99 angrily. â\\x80\\x98 Donâ\\x80\\x99t I know what it means ?

But I know well the effect itâ\\x80\\x99ll have upon Bill, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m determined he shall know nothing about it. Give me the letter ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What are you going to do with it, mother P â\\x80\\x99 enquired Bessie anxiously. â\\x80\\x98 I havenâ\\x80\\x99t read the half of it yet.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Give me the letter,â\\x80\\x99 repeated the widow, holding out her hand. â\\x80\\x98 Wonâ\\x80\\x99t you let me read it to you first ? â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie, involuntarily clasping it tighter. â\\x80\\x98 Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot more coming, about how one is to set about working, and what uncleâ\\x80\\x99s boys and girls are going to do. Let me read the rest, mother.â\\x80\\x99100 TIWAUTED ; OR, â\\x80\\x98 Give it to me, I say ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed lier mother, angrily; â\\x80\\x98is it your letter, or is it mine ? â\\x80\\x99 Then, as the girl still seemed to hesitate, she snatched it from her detaining hand ; and, without glancing at the contents, she crossed the room with three strides, and flung envelope, letter, and all into the fire ! Bessie started forward, as if to try and save it from the flames ; but it was twisted into tinder in an instant. â\\x80\\x98 Mother ! mother ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed in despair, â\\x80\\x98 oh ! what have you done ? How could youâ\\x80\\x94how could you ? oh ! what will Bill say ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done what I think right,â\\x80\\x99 the widow answered gloomily ; â\\x80\\x98 and as Bill will never be any the wiser, heâ\\x80\\x99ll have nothing to say. For heâ\\x80\\x99ll never hear anything of it from me,DUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A hexâ\\x80\\x99s NEST. 101 and I wonâ\\x80\\x99t have you say a word about it either.â\\x80\\x99 Bessie looked up, bewildered, and as if she thought she could not have heard right. â\\x80\\x98 What did you say, mother ? â\\x80\\x99 she said in a low voice, as she strove to keep down the tumult of indignation she felt rising in her breast ; â\\x80\\x98 that I am not to tell Billâ\\x80\\x94Bill anything about it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said her mother, 4 thatâ\\x80\\x99s what I said, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s what I mean. I forbid you even to tell him Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a letter from Bournbyâ\\x80\\x94do you hear ? â\\x80\\x99 A torrent of words rushed to Bessieâ\\x80\\x99s lips, but she forced them back, and answered in the same low tone, â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure I ought to obey you, mother ; so I donâ\\x80\\x99t know that I can promise that.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 And I say that you must promise it, and quickly too,â\\x80\\x99 said the widow hotly ; â\\x80\\x98 for102 THWARTED ; OR, Bill will be here in a moment.

Promise ! â\\x80\\x99 She laid her hand on the girlâ\\x80\\x99s arm eagerly ; and Bessie was frightened to feel how it trembled, and at the violent agitation working in her motherâ\\x80\\x99s face. Feelings, half of fear and half of com 172 passion, came over her again as they had done the night before, and she felt resistance to be cruel and impossible. â\\x80\\x98 I promise,â\\x80\\x99 she said sadly ; and then she escaped from the room, to hide the tears she could no longer repress.

He looked happy, and was quite disposed to talk at dinner, and to be communicative about his visit to the Big House. That is, as far as the child was concerned He did not mention the box. He wished to keep as far as possible from all dangerous topics ; for he had the memory of last nightâ\\x80\\x99s conversation fresh in his mind, and he did not wish to distress his mother aa:ain. O The washerwoman was quite as ready as her son to keep up a conversation ; for as the meal went on, she got a little uneasy at Bessie s non-appearance, and did not wish him to notice it.104 THWARTED ; OR, She was also rather fearful lest the girl should appear with a tear-stained counte 172 nance ; and that Bill should begin to ask questions. She was growing a little bit afraid of her children. They were making such rapid advances into manhood and womanhood, and had several times lately shown a disposition to take their lives into their own hands. If they banded together against lier in this matter of the letter from Bournby, what was she to do ? To be sure she had implicit faith in Bessieâ\\x80\\x99s obedience, and in her given promise : but she dreaded her sonâ\\x80\\x99s questioning, and his resolution to come to the bottom of the affair ; if his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s appearance should make him suspicious, or if her protracted absenceducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A iienâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 105 from the dinner-table should attract his at 172 tention. â\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a funny little girl of Mrs. Her 172 bertâ\\x80\\x99s,â\\x80\\x99 said Bill. Here Bessie slipped quietly in, and took her place without meeting her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s eye, though he looked up and smiled at her entrance. The washerwoman glanced nervously at her ; but lier fears were allayed by seeing that, though she looked pale and sad, all traces of crying had passed away. Still, all was not safe yet ; for Bill was looking hard at Bessie, as if wondering why she did not return his smile of greeting : so the widow went on hurriedly : â\\x80\\x98Yes : sheâ\\x80\\x99s a funny little girl, is little Miss Herbert, and as spoilt as spoilt can be. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s never been contradicted in her life, I106 THWARTED ; OR, believe, or refused anything she wished for. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s the only one Mrs. Herbert has reared, you see. The rest all died one after the other, before they could run alone. But how came you to see her, Bill ? Itâ\\x80\\x99s never happened before when youâ\\x80\\x99ve been up to the house with the clothes, has it ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well no,â\\x80\\x99 said Bill ; â\\x80\\x98 I generally wait in the kitchen ; but to-day the child was sent down with the message instead of the maid ; and she stayed chatting on, and forgot to give it me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Where were you waiting ? â\\x80\\x99 asked his mother ; â\\x80\\x98 did the child come into the kitchen ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ho,â\\x80\\x99 Bill answered ; â\\x80\\x98 they put me into a room they called the little library.â\\x80\\x99 He was getting abstracted ; for the thought of the child was bringing back to him the box with which she was so insepar-ducksâ\\x80\\x99 egos in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 107 ably connected ; and he hardly heard now what his mother was saying. â\\x80\\x98 The child likes her own way, and has always had it ; but for all that, the servants say sheâ\\x80\\x99s too good to be spoilt, though sheâ\\x80\\x99s as wild as a bird.â\\x80\\x99 But Billâ\\x80\\x99s interest was gone ; he had relapsed into silence and dreaminess. How 172 ever, the danger was past, so the widow did not try to keep up the conversation. For the meal was over, and Bessie was beginning to clear away the things. Bill rose after a time, and said he must be off to the farm. As he left the cottage, he turned round and asked Bessie to be at the milestone in the village about four, to meet him on his return from his work. â\\x80\\x98 As you are going to shop there,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98 we may as well meet, and walk home together.â\\x80\\x99108 THWARTED ; OR, Bessie assented, but not with lier usual alacrity. The truth was, she would have given anything to escape a tÃªte-Ã\\xa0-tÃªte walk with her brother that afternoon. Poor girl ! her accustomed pleasure was turned into pain by what had occurred. She quite dreaded being alone with Bill ; and besides, she had read in his eyes that he had something particular to tell her. How could she be the recipient of his hopes and fears, with the strain of her promise upon her ? How could she talk and sympathise as usual when she knew, what he did not, that the eagerly-desired hand had at last been held out to help him ; and that she was privy to its being flung aside ? She sighed heavily as she cleared away the dinner-things, and tidied up the room.ducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A hexâ\\x80\\x99s xest. 109 She was quite alone, for the widow, who perhaps shrank a little from being with her daughter with no third person present, had retired into the wash-house ; and Charlie was playing in the garden. All of a sudden, Bessieâ\\x80\\x99s eye fell upon a printed paper lying on the ground at her feet ; and she picked it up with a start. For it flashed across her in an instant what it must be ; and hope suddenly revived in her breast. She unfolded it eagerly, and read in large letters at the top : Bournby Industrial Exhibition.

Her cheeks flushed, and her eyes sparkled ; while on her lips the question trembled, â\\x80\\x98 Shall I give it to Bill ? â\\x80\\x99 It was a terrible temptation. Conflicting feelings chased each other through her brain. How was she to tell it was right to let him lose this golden opportunity ? How did she know she ought to take upon herself the responsibility of blighting his life in this way ? Was she to be the arbitrator of her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s fate ? V Was she not sacrificing him to a weak fear of her own : because she hated to agitate and distress her mother ?112 THWARTED ; OR, She must weigh these questions carefully in her own mind ; and give each their proper balance. But no ! she had had a command laid upon her ; and she had promised. It was, alas ! no longer a question of due weight and just balance; but a question of her Avord given ; her obedience pledged. She felt such a traitor to him on the one hand, to her mother on the other : which 172 ever Avay she looked at the subject, she felt as if she Avronged some one. Could she not compromise matters ? Supposing, for argumentâ\\x80\\x99s sake, she handed Bill the paper without speaking. Her motherâ\\x80\\x99s words had only been, â\\x80\\x98 I forbid you to tell him anything about it : even that I have had a letter from Bournby.â\\x80\\x99 It Avas to that command that she had ansAvered 4 1 promise.â\\x80\\x99ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 113 Well ! by this means she did not disobey the command, and at the same time she saved her brother. Or she might put the paper in his room, and leave him to find it there : thus easing her conscience by having nothing personally, as it were, to do with the affair. Bill was old enough to judge for himself in these matters. Surely her mother was stretching her authority beyond its limits in thus hiding from a son in early manhood what was so much to his advantage. She got so far as her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s little room ; and then paused. Obedience to the letter might be hers, but how about the spirit of her motherâ\\x80\\x99s command*? She saw suddenly the miserable sophistry of her argument, and felt she was acting wrongly. i114 THAVÃ\\x81BTED ; OE, No ! it must not be ! She must think of something else. But now that she was surrounded by Billâ\\x80\\x99s carving, the proofs of the rare talent she so firmly believed in ; she grew indignant at being bound to thwart him in this way. Why should her mother set her face so against it ? What was this secret in the past for ever starting up to mar her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s prospects ? She Avould go to her at once, and demand an explanation. She had been weak last night to interrupt her brother Avlien they were so nearly discovering Avhat the mystery was : but she would be Aveak no longer. She would force her mother to explain all, and then when Bill came home, tell him what it Avas that for ever stood in his way, and let him judge for himself in future.

If she refused !â\\x80\\x94then she would tell her plainly that her intention was to cancel the promise wrung from her at a disadvantage : and Bill should learn the chance that was offered to him, and himself decide whether it was to be thrown away. But it was only for a moment that the girl allowed her feelings thus to get the better or her. She was smarting under Billâ\\x80\\x99s wrongs, and was transformed into a Nemesis for his sake. But soon her own right feeling and the memory of her mother chased these hard thoughts away. I 2116 THWARTED ; OR, That poor hard-worked mother, who had toiled for them all her life !...

It was nearly three oâ\\x80\\x99clock when Bessie and Charlie started for their shopping in the village. The girl looked very pale, and there was a sad look in her eyes ; but her face bore no other signs of her late conflict. She had done all she could to remove any traces of it, for fear either of her brothers should be suspicious ; and she exerted herself to talk cheerfully to Charlie as they walked along, in order that his attention should not be drawn to her in any way. It took her some little time to make all her purchases in the village. So that it was124 THWARTED ; OR, past four oâ\\x80\\x99clock before she turned her steps towards the milestone where Bill had ap 172 pointed her to meet him.

She dreaded so to find herself alone with him, as â\\x80¢ usual : and she kept Charlie close by her side, because his presence generally prevent 172 ed their conversation taking a confidential tone ; and she had a cowardly wish to put off the evil moment as long as possible. Bill had looked so happy at dinner that day, that she was quite sure he had some 172 thing pleasant to tell her connected with his carving ; and how to meet his eager eye with her accustomed sympathy and interest she did not know. But when she saw Bill coming along, all thoughts of herself, or of her secret, went out of her head.ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs ix a hexâ\\x80\\x99s xest. 125 Something had happened since the morn 172 ing, she felt quite sure. He no longer looked the same. He walked along slowly and unwillingly, as if he also were putting off the meeting to the latest possible moment. The happy look had gone out of his face, and it was a shade paler than usual. He cast a bored impatient look at Charlie as he came up ; and Bessie saw in a moment he wanted to get rid of the little boy, that he might speak to her alone. Frightened at his appearance, and eager to learn what had happened, she gave Charlie the parcels, and told him to run home with them as quick as possible. Bill watched his little brother till he was out of hearing ; and then turning round to Bessie, he said abruptly, â\\x80\\x98 Bess ! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve lost my place ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What! â\\x80\\x99 cried the girl.126 THWARTED ; OR, â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve lost my place at tlie farm,â\\x80\\x99 he repeated ; â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m discharged ! â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94 Bessie felt as if all the world were tumbling about her head, and could not collect her thoughts for a minute. In her quiet monotonous life, the smallest change was an event ; and now everything seemed to be happening at once. She felt as if she had lived years since she got up that morning ; and as if all the cares of life had come upon her in one short day. Billâ\\x80\\x99s announcement was so suddenâ\\x80\\x94so startling. The discharge of which he spake so quietly was such a calamity, and one so totally unlooked for. It meant such ruin, and such poverty, for them all. Without Billâ\\x80\\x99s wages, which formedducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 127 such a large part of the family income, what were they to do P Other thoughts, more closely connected with her own affairs, shot for a moment through her brain ; but she was too unselfish to dwell upon them. Her chief regret was for the others. â\\x80\\x98 Oh Bill ! Bill ! what are we to do ? What is to become of us ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. I canâ\\x80\\x99t look forward. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve hardly realised it yet. It has been so sudden, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been so taken by sur 172 prise.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Mother ! â\\x80\\x99 she gasped ; â\\x80\\x98 oh, what will mother say ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m not going to tell her just yet. I want time to collect my thoughts before I can talk it over with her. I shall let her have Sunday in peace, for of course on Monday she must know. By that time I may have128 THWARTED ; OR, seen some way out of this new trouble ; but just now . . . â\\x80\\x98 How was it, Bill ? How came the farmer to discharge you in this sudden way ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s not altogether so sudden as you think. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve known for some time that heâ\\x80\\x99s been discontented with me, though I didnâ\\x80\\x99t expect anything of this kind. You see I canâ\\x80\\x99t get through the work the rest can. But whatâ\\x80\\x99s brought matters to a crisis is that a nephew of his, who happened to come on a visit, lias asked him for my place ; and as he is a fellow with twice my strength, the farmer is very glad to kill two birds with one stone, by obliging his nephew, and setting a better workman. I don\\'t blame O O him myself. Heâ\\x80\\x99s behaved very handsomely to me, and has paid me my wages in advance instead of giving me warning, because heDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 129 wants his nephew to begin at once. So we shanâ\\x80\\x99t starve just yet. You wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t wonder at the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s choice, Bess, if you saw this great strapping fellow ! Why, my arm by hisâ\\x80\\x99 he concluded, laughing, â\\x80\\x98 looks like a lucifer match ! â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad you can laugh, Bill,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie, mournfully. â\\x80\\x98 Well, it is odd, I ownâ\\x80\\x99; but somehow, after the first shock of surprise, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not so down as I thought I was. I canâ\\x80\\x99t think why Iâ\\x80\\x99m not more distressed about it. I shall be, I know, by and by, when-it comes to breaking it to mother. I think perhaps it is that I feel more free than I did. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have thrown up my means of living, but as my means of living have thrown me up, it seems easier, somehow, to start on my own line of life than it did before.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 But how ? â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie, bitterly ; â\\x80\\x98 what130 THWARTED ; OR, better prospects have you of getting a start now than you had yesterday ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No, thatâ\\x80\\x99s true,â\\x80\\x99 said Bill, thoughtfully and more dejectedly than he had hitherto spoken. Poor Bessie spoke bitterly ; for she could not dwell calmly on the future that lay before them, on the privations and the poverty in store ; but more than all, her heart smote her, as she thought of that chance of a start in life for Bill, that had that very day been held out ; that wasted oppor 172 tunity which might be, which was, of the utmost importance now. How gladly would she have held out to her brother that little bit of consolation, that hope which she knew, would more than make up to him for the loss he had just sustained. â\\x80\\x98 Surely, surely,â\\x80\\x99 she reflected, â\\x80\\x98 motherDUCKS â\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A HENâ\\x80\\x99S NEST. 131 will change her mind about it now. Surely she will relent when she learns what has happened. It is Billâ\\x80\\x99s last chance.â\\x80\\x99 But here a sudden thought struck her with dismay. If Bill did not tell his mother about it till Monday, might it not be too late ? Might not the letter to her uncle be written, refusing his offer ? Of course it would be so ! Sunday was her motherâ\\x80\\x99s only day for writing a letter ; and by Monday it would be posted and gone ! Here was indeed a new dilemma. What must she do ? She must try and turn Bill from his purpose. She must try and persuade him not to keep his mother in ignorance ; but to tell her at once of his discharge. K 2132 THWARTED ; OR, But how do so without making him suspicious ? Would lie not at once ask her why? And then what was she to say ? Before she had come to any conclusion, Billâ\\x80\\x99s voice broke in upon her meditation. 1 1 say, Bess, what are you thinking about so deeply ? I want you to talk it all over with me, and you donâ\\x80\\x99t say a word.â\\x80\\x99 There was no time for reflection. An 172 swer she must ; and she dashed at once into the subject. â\\x80\\x98 I was thinking, Bill, that it would be better to tell mother about it at once.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh, no ! â\\x80\\x99 he answered ; â\\x80\\x98 I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t do that. I must have a little time for prepar 172 ation.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Indeed, Bill,â\\x80\\x99 she said earnestly, â\\x80\\x98 it would be the best way.â\\x80\\x99 But Bill was firm.ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 133 â\\x80\\x98 You know what mother is, Bessie. Her lamentations and reproaches would bewilder and weaken me. I must have some course of action settled, so as to hold out conso 172 lation to her with one hand, after having dealt her such a blow with the other. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you see ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes, Bill ; â\\x80\\x99 and now Bessieâ\\x80\\x99s heart began to beat so violently that her agitation betrayed itself in her voice ; â\\x80\\x98 but still if you will only trust me, and tell her to-day, I think it will be better for us all.â\\x80\\x99 Attracted by something in her tone, Bill turned round upon her, and tried to look into her averted face. â\\x80\\x98 Bess, why are you so odd and deter â\\x96\\xa0 mined about it ? What in the world is the matter?â\\x80\\x99 he added quickly, as he saw the agitation working on her features. â\\x80\\x98 Oh nothing, nothing,â\\x80\\x99 she said, alarmed134 THWARTED ; OR, only eager now to change the subject, seeing that she should not be able to shake his re 172 solution. â\\x80\\x98 What made you look so happy at dinner to-day, Bill F â\\x80\\x99 Billâ\\x80\\x99s attention was instantly diverted, and he launched into a glowing description of the beautiful work of art he had seen at the Big House. â\\x80\\x98 It haunts me, Bess ! â\\x80\\x99 he concluded. â\\x80\\x98 I see it wherever I look, and I am going to try and do it from recollection directly I get home.â\\x80\\x99 Bessie listened to him with a sinking heart. More and more bitterly did her thoughts dwell upon the chance for Bill that had that day been offered and rejected. Bill put down her apathy and unusual depression to the shock of the news of his discharge, and did not bother her with any questions.ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 135 Arrived at home, he kissed her kindly, bidding her not distress herself about it over much. â\\x80\\x98 Hope on, hope ever,â\\x80\\x99 he said ; â\\x80\\x98 some 172 thing will turn up.â\\x80\\x99 He disappeared at once into his little den, from whence he did not emerge till supper-time. In his engrossing occupation he lost sight of his trouble, and he went to bed happy in the mere thought of his work ; while his poor sister, with no such consola 172 tion to raise her drooping spirits, sought her couch with a heavy heart ; weighed down by the burden of the double secret which had been laid upon her that day.CHAPTER VIII. THE PARABLE OF THE TALENTS.CHAPTER YHI. The next day was Sunday, and the Tarver family attended morning service as usual. After dinner Bill went out for a stroll ; and Bessie established herself by the fire with a book. Charlie got out his bible, and began to prepare his lesson for the Sunday-school, which took place in the afternoon. Bessie watched her motherâ\\x80\\x99s movements anxiously, for she was dreadfully afraid she was going to write a letter. Too true! Mrs. Tarver got out her writing materials and sat herself down at the table in the window.140 THWARTED ; OR, She put the printed paper carefully into an envelope ; and then spread out her paper and began to write. Even at that distance Bessie could see. â\\x80\\x98 My dear Ned,â\\x80\\x94This comes hop â\\x80\\x99 The girl turned away her head, and gazed into the fire with a strange feeling of heart-sickness. She breathed a silent prayer for help : that something might turn her motherâ\\x80\\x99s intention, even at this the eleventh hour ;â\\x80\\x94 though what was to do it she could not think. It was hopeless now, quite hope 172 less. â\\x80¢ Bess,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94said Charlieâ\\x80\\x99s voice at this moment, â\\x80\\x98 what is a talent ? â\\x80\\x99 Why had the boy chosen this time to in 172 troduce such a topic ? How was she to under 172 take an explanation just when her heart was so sore on that very subject?ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 141 But Charlie often required her help in his preparation, and would not understand her refusing it. â\\x80\\x98 What makes you ask, Charlie ? â\\x80\\x99 she said to gain time. â\\x80\\x98 Weâ\\x80\\x99ve got the â\\x80\\x9c Parable of the Ta 172 lents â\\x80\\x9d for this afternoonâ\\x80\\x99s questioning,â\\x80\\x99 he answered. Bessie saw there was no hope of avert 172 ing an answer, nor of avoiding a conversation on the subject. So she gave her mind to the question at once. She wondered just a little if her mother were listening ; and glanced at her furtively. But she could not make out whether she were or not. The widow was bending over her writing, o o 7 with her back turned. â\\x80\\x98 A talent,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie, accustomed to142 THWARTED ; OR, put everything into the most simple language for the little children at the infant school, 4 is anything God has given us to make use of.â\\x80\\x99 4 But if we donâ\\x80\\x99t make use of it, is it a talent then ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Charlie. 4 It is still a talent,â\\x80\\x99 she answered, 4 but a wasted one. The servant who hid his talent in the earth wasted it ; but it was a talent all the same, and his lord, when he came, called him to account for it. So God will call us to account for the use we have made of our talents, or to answer for having wasted them.â\\x80\\x99 She spoke in a low rather hurried tone ; but for all that, her words must have reached the widowâ\\x80\\x99s ears. For her pen stoppedâ\\x80\\x94 she was evidently listening. Bessie, whose head was turned towardsducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A hexâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 143 her little brother, did not observe it, and the conversation went on. â\\x80\\x98 I suppose very few people have talents ? â\\x80\\x99 said Charlie. â\\x80\\x98 More than you would think,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie softly ; â\\x80\\x98 in fact, it seems to me, most people have a talent of some kind.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What is motherâ\\x80\\x99s ? â\\x80\\x99 asked Charlie. Bessie hesitated a minute, and was going to Â«peak, when Charlie interrupted her : â\\x80\\x98 Wash 172 ing, I suppose,â\\x80\\x99 he said, Â£ and ironing; oh ! and clear-starching, and I should think mangling too.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie thoughtfully ; â\\x80\\x98 and mother makes use of her talents well.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 If she didnâ\\x80\\x99t wash, and iron, and clear 172 starch, and mangle, sheâ\\x80\\x99d be hiding her talents in the earth, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t she ? â\\x80\\x99 Bessie assented, adding, â\\x80\\x98 and God has144 THWARTED ; OR, given her health and strength to do it with, O O \\' for they are talents too.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What other things are talents, Bess ? tell me some everybody has got.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Life, first of all,â\\x80\\x99 she answered ; â\\x80\\x98 God has given us each a life to make the best use we can of ; and for the use we have made of it we shall have to give account some day. If we waste it, we shall have to answer for it to God when He comes, like the lord of the servants in the parable, and reckons with us. Then there is Time, in the same way. Then there is Youth and Opportunity, and Health and Strength, and itâ\\x80\\x99s wonderful how we waste them all, without seeming to re 172 member that we shall be called to account for the use we have made of them. Then again there are those that are more special and which are only given to a few, such as power, influence, money, and cleverness.ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 145 After that come the gifts ; preaching like St. Paul, writing books, painting, music, sculp 172 ture, and other things of that kind.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I see,â\\x80\\x99 said Charlie musingly ; Â£ and I suppose youâ\\x80\\x99ve got a talent and a gift ; for I heard our master say the other day, that you had such a talent for teaching, it was quite a gift. If you didnâ\\x80\\x99t teach, Bessie, should you be hiding a talent in the earth ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 she answered very low ; â\\x80\\x98 I believe so, Charlie.â\\x80\\x99 The widow had put down her pen, and was sitting very still. â\\x80\\x98 Have I got any special talent, Bess ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, no Charlie, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you have.â\\x80\\x99 Charlie drew a long breath of great relief. â\\x80\\x98 And Bill ? â\\x80\\x99 was the next question. Bessie got hot all over ; for she no L146 THWARTED ; OR, longer heard the scratching of her motherâ\\x80\\x99s O o pen, and she began to think she must be listening. Had she dared look round, she would have seen the widow sitting bolt up 172 right, with her unfinished letter before her. â\\x80\\x98 You know as well as I do,â\\x80\\x99 she said, almost in a whisper. â\\x80\\x98 Oh carving,â\\x80\\x99 said Charlie, loudly ; â\\x80\\x98 so it is, of course. Why thatâ\\x80\\x99s something like painting, or sculpture, I should think. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s quite a gift, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it ? â\\x80\\x99 Bessie bowed her head. She could not trust herself to speak. â\\x80\\x98 Then if Bill doesnâ\\x80\\x99t go on with his carving, heâ\\x80\\x99ll be hiding a talent in the earth, wonâ\\x80\\x99t lie P â\\x80\\x99 A very low answer from Bessie. The widow moved restlessly in her chair. â\\x80\\x98 I mean it would be wasting a talentducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 147 God has given him, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it ? â\\x80\\x99 the per 172 tinacious voice went on. Another low murmur from the girl. Another restless movement from the mother in the distance. â\\x80\\x98 Then heâ\\x80\\x99d have to give account to God some day for not having made use of it ; eh, Bess ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 No ! â\\x80\\x99 came in low accents the reply ; â\\x80\\x98 it will not be his fault. He is so situated that he cannot help it.â\\x80\\x99 The widow took up her unfinished letter, and tore it into little pieces. â\\x80\\x98Well! I must be off,â\\x80\\x99 said Charlie, rising, and collecting his books. â\\x80\\x98 Thank you, Â« Bessie, I understand the parable much better now.â\\x80\\x99 And he ran away, whistling. Bessie sat quite still after he was gone, gazing sadly into the fire, and thinking more148 THWARTED ; OR, regretfully than ever of the wasted talent, and the rejected opportunity. A touch on her shoulder roused her. Her mother was standing by her, holding out the printed paper. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve changed my mind about this,â\\x80\\x99 she said ; â\\x80\\x98 you may give it to Bill, and he can make what use he likes of it.â\\x80\\x99 And before Bessie could recover from her surprise, her mother had left the room. Bessie first bowed her head in silent thankfulness and wonder that her prayer should thus have been heard ; then, hurriedly putting on her bonnet, she went in search of Bill. We need not paint the interview ; nor dwell upon the young manâ\\x80\\x99s astonishment, his bewildered feverish delight. A flush rose on his cheek, a glad light came into his eye ; he eagerly stretched outducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 149 his hand for the paper, and greedily devoured the contents. He covered his face for a moment, as if this sudden realisation of his wishes were almost too much for him ; and then he poured forth a torrent of questions. When had it come ? How had it come ? How was it he had not heard of it before ? Bessie answered by giving him an ac 172 count of yesterday, with its temptation, its conflict, and its final victory. Her conduct met with his unqualified approval. He would not have had her act otherwise, he assured her, for all the Exhibi 172 tions in the kingdom. â\\x80\\x98 No good could ever have come of doing evil,â\\x80\\x99 he said ; â\\x80\\x98 and the first bad consequence would have been motherâ\\x80\\x99s putting down my discharge to my head having been turned by this prospect.â\\x80\\x99150 THWARTED ; OR, Brother and sister wandered slowly homewards arm in arm ; building airy castles as they went, of Billâ\\x80\\x99s future great 172 ness. Their happy voices and their laughter rang out in the clear frosty air, and reached their motherâ\\x80\\x99s ear as she stood at the open door. â\\x80\\x98 Bless me, children, how merry you seem ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, as they entered the cottage together. â\\x80\\x98 And no wonder,â\\x80\\x99 said Bill, joyously, going up to her, paper in hand, and kissing her warmly. â\\x80\\x98 Youâ\\x80\\x99re a foolish boy,â\\x80\\x99 she said, but she looked happy all the same ; â\\x80\\x98 and Iâ\\x80\\x99m a foolish woman to put such ideas into your head. But promise me one thing. Bill. Itâ\\x80\\x99ll not make you give up your place.

Come to the window, mother, quick, and have a look at him ! â\\x80\\x99 The widow was at his side in three strides.152 THWARTED. Her maternal vanity was wounded, and she was indignant at the idea of the â\\x80\\x98 strapping fellow,â\\x80\\x99 who had eclipsed her boy. â\\x80\\x98 Well !

At least you look like a man, though a slim one ; and that fellow. . . .â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What does he look like, mother ? â\\x80\\x99 laughed Bill. â\\x80\\x98 I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell you,â\\x80\\x99 she answered, turn 172 ing in disgust from the window, â\\x80\\x98 for if I looked at him again, I should have no appetite for supper ! â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER IX. THE SISTERâ\\x80\\x99S SELF-SACRIFICE.CHAPTER IX. Pill knew it was best to strike while the iron was hot, lest his mother should change her mind. He therefore lost no time in com 172 municating with his uncle at Bournby, and he received in reply, all the necessary in 172 structions. The next week passed quietly and un 172 eventfully. The widow worked away harder than ever, and asked 110 questions when Bill disappeared for hours in his little den. She had, as it were, given in under pro 172 test ; and though she would not for worlds have retracted her permission, she yet wished to show that she herself was still of the same15G THWARTED ; OR, mind as ever ; and so did not take any interest in the matter. Bessie, relieved from the strain of her secret, and more hopeful than her mother, was very happy again ; and if for a moment a misgiving came over her as to what was to become of them all if Bill did not succeed, like others, in getting noticed and helped through the Industrial Exhibition, she quickly chased it away ; and her dreams of his future success surpassed even his own. Bill, his heart beating high with hope, was absorbed in his work, and thought and cared for nothing else. Early and late he toiled without ceasing ; and there began to grow under his hands a work of rare beauty, which already, even in its outline, bore a resemblance to the box he had seen. His great fear was of forgetting theDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A henâ\\x80\\x99s NEST. 157 design, before lie had sufficiently progressed to be able to work it out. He was so afraid of its fading from his recollection. It haunted him, this fear. He would sit with his head between his hands, and his eyes closed, straining brain and memory to recall its every detail : but not always with entire success. He could not always remember it exactly. He got a little confused sometimes ; and the details would crowd upon him with such distinct 172 ness, as to make him a little uncertain how to group them so as to form an harmonious whole. He needed sorely another sight of the box to make certain how the parts blended together. One day he got so hot and impatient over the incapability which possessed him158 THWARTED ; OR, of recalling tlie design to his satisfaction, that he left his little room, and went out into the garden to refresh himself in the air. But the change of scene seemed only to obliterate more completely what he was try 172 ing to remember. He felt he must give up the hope of its returning to his mind for that day ; and went into the wash-house to talk to his mother. She was busy sorting the clothes that had arrived that day from the Big House ; and he stayed chatting some minutes. All of a sudden, without his being aware of the cause, the scene in the little library returned to him ; the box rose before him, design, details, and all. His attention wandered from what his mother was saying, and he stood silent, gazing as it seemed to her, into vacancy ;ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 159 while a look of eager intelligence spread itself over his face. Hope awoke once more within him, and with a hastily muttered excuse, lie hurried away to his den again, and eagerly set to work. â\\x80\\x98 Bless the boy ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed his mother, as she plunged the clothes into the tub, â\\x80\\x98 heâ\\x80\\x99s clean demented over that wood-work.

Ilis eyes must have seen a vision to which his motherâ\\x80\\x99s were closed. The power of association was the unseen spell. His eyes had fallen on something that had brought back the lid to his mind. But it was only a tiny linen cuff, with the stain of a bon-bon upon it !160 THWARTED ; OR, Towards the end of a fortnight or so, the loss of Billâ\\x80\\x99s wages began to make itself felt. It was patent to each one, though no one made any remark upon it Everything approaching to a luxury dis 172 appeared by degrees from the table. The truth was, no one but the widow was now contributing anything towards the family maintenance. Bather the contrary : since both for Bessie and Charlie a weekly sum of money had to be forthcoming. It was getting clearer every day to the widow that this state of things could not go o o on. There was no doubt in her mind that until Bill got work of some sort, Bessie must give up her teaching, and assist with the washing.ducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A hexâ\\x80\\x99s xest. 1G1 There was no other way of adding to the family funds. The widow could not undertake more washing by herself, and if she hired an assistant, the womanâ\\x80\\x99s pay would swallow up nearly all the extra money gained. Mrs. Tarver knew it would be a great blow to her daughter, and from day to day she put off speaking to her on the subject, half hoping the girl would suddenly see the necessity herself, and spare her the pain of urging it upon her. The poor mother pondered the matter as she worked and toiled without ceasing ; but could think of no other way of increasing their means but by pressing Bessie into the service. She took the precaution, however, of letting it be known in the village that Bill was out of work ; and then waited a little to M1C2 THWARTED ; OR, see what might turn up. But nothing came of it, and daily the meals grew more frugal, and the sting of poverty began to make itself felt. And meanwhile Bessie, though she said nothing, had told herself from the first how it must end. It was only because she had seen no immediate prospect of there being more washing than her mother could do by herself, that she had refrained from speaking. But coming home one evening from the schools, she saw two strange children playing in the Bectory garden, and knew that the time had come. For strangers meant guests to the Bector, and guests meant extra washing. It was all over then. Her hopes and ambitions must be given up for this year : for it only wanted a few weeks to the ex-ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a iienâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 168 amination, and she needed every minute of her time to fit herself to pass it. She leant sadly against the gate, watch 172 ing the children at their play, till she was roused by the voice of the rectorâ\\x80\\x99s house 172 keeper calling her by name. She opened the gate, and went in. â\\x80\\x98 Masterâ\\x80\\x99s quite laid up with rheumatism,â\\x80\\x99 said the housekeeper, advancing to meet her. 4 His brotherâ\\x80\\x99s come to take the duty for him, and brought his family with him. I was just going to send down to your mother to see if she can take their washing when I saw you coming along. You can tell me, I daresay.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Oh yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie, mechanically, 4 we can take it : yes, we can take the washing.â\\x80\\x99 4 And then we shall want an odd man to do jobs inside and out while they are here. Your mother was saying your brother M 2164 THWARTED ; OR, William was out of place. Would lie like to come, do you think ? â\\x80\\x99 If Bessie had felt weak before, she did so no longer now. If she had told herself before that it was hard that she should have to give up all her cherished hopes and ambitions, all such thoughts were put to flight now. For well she knew that did she did not undertake the washing, her mother would accept the place for Bill. As only one need be sacrificed, it should be herself ; not him. He, at any rate, should be left undisturbed, free to give his whole mind to his carving. So she quickly, even eagerly, reiterated her assurances that she and her mother would take the extra washing, and in the same breath declined the â\\x80\\x98 odd manâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x99 place for Bill.DUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A HEKâ\\x80\\x99S NEST. 165 â\\x80\\x98 Better me than him,â\\x80\\x99 she said to herself over and over again as she walked home ; and she went straight to her mother, and told her what she had done.

THE FAIRY CHILD AT THE INFANT SCHOOL.CHAPTER X. Of course as Rill went on with his work the difficulties increased. Some parts were com 172 paratively easy, but there were others that baffled him. Either the task he had undertaken was beyond him ; or else a good deal had escaped his notice. After all, he had only seen it once. He felt sure that another glance at the box would remove the difficulty ; but then how was he ever to get into the little library again ? He was almost out of heart one Saturday, Bessieâ\\x80\\x99s last day at the schools.170 THWARTED ; OR, So he threw down his knife, and bethought him of noms; to meet her, to soften D DO \\' lier sorrow at leaving, and to pour his. own troubles into her ear. He started off accordingly ; but arrived at his destination much too soon. It wanted half an hour or more to the time for breaking up. He sat down on a bank outside the schools ; and closing his eyes, strove once more to summon up the box before him. It was a soft spring day : the air blew pleasantly in his face : he felt soothed already. Presently from within the school-house broke out upon the still air a burst of little voices. â\\x80\\x99Tis a lesson yon should learn : Try, try, try again, etc. etc.ducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A hexâ\\x80\\x99s xest. 171 It chimed in with Billâ\\x80\\x99s feelings very pleasantly : the words seemed to give him hope and encouragement, and the singing of the little voices in unison was very soothing : and so was the clap of all the little hands at regular intervals. He began to think of Dick Whittington 011 the milestone, listening to the chimes bidding him back to hope and fortune ; and wondered if he might gather courage in the same way. Were not the little voices holding out hopes of success to him too ? Was any difficulty ever surmounted except by the perseverance of which they sang? . . . But the children had ceased singing and all was very still. By and bye, through the silent air, there172 THWARTED ; OR, fell upon his ear the clattering of a ponyâ\\x80\\x99s hoofs in the distance. Nearer and nearer they approached. At last they stopped suddenly. There was a merry laugh close to him, and a silvery voice said in clear, rather imperious tones, â\\x80\\x98 William Tarver ! â\\x80\\x99 But Bill did not look up. For something, he knew not what, had transported him back, he knew not where 172 fore, to the little library at the Big House ; to the place where he longed to be ! There was the box, standing on the table ! Its design was returning to him ! and fervently he hoped nought might disturb him, till he had made it his own once more. Vain hope ! Again the silvery voice exclaims, â\\x80\\x98William Tarver ! â\\x80\\x99ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 173 This time he recognises it, and opens his eyes. lie sees before him a tiny pony, and on it the fairy child. He hardly sees her, for her presence recalls the box. Clearer and clearer she seems to bring it before him. They are so inseparably connected, these two ; he cannot disunite them. Here are the laughing eyes, and the wild fair hair ; and, resting on the pony is an ungloved hand ; the same that rested on the lid ! And there, close by, rises behind her, the feathery foliage, and the grouping of the perfect whole ! 4 You donâ\\x80\\x99t look as if you knew me,â\\x80\\x99 said little Miss Herbert. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take off my hat.â\\x80\\x99 She did so, and shaking her hair out of171 THWARTED ; OR, her eyes, she exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98 There ! now do you remember me ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I beg your pardon, Miss,â\\x80\\x99 he said, rising slowly, and taking off his cap ; â\\x80\\x98 I think I was half asleep.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Well ! it is lucky I found you here,â\\x80\\x99 she said ; â\\x80\\x98 for Iâ\\x80\\x99ve come to hear the children at the Infant School do their lessons like you advised me to, and I shall want some one to show me the way.â\\x80\\x99 Bill looked rather scared. â\\x80\\x98 So now you can take me in,â\\x80\\x99 she went on, gathering up her skirts and jumping off her pony. â\\x80\\x98 Give me your hand, and come with me, for I donâ\\x80\\x99t like going in alone.â\\x80\\x99 Bill demurred. â\\x80\\x98 Take me in, I say,â\\x80\\x99 said the spoilt child. â\\x80\\x98 You never will do what I ask you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 What about the pony, Miss ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 The pony will stand.

Bessie was sitting with her little class round her, the only teacher in the room. The smallest child in the school was on her lap ; another was leaning against her, the rest were all pressing as close as they could. She was telling them she should not be able to come and teach them any more. There was consternation 011 all the little faces ; one child was crying. At the sound of footsteps Bessie looked up, and to her astonishment, she saw her brother advancing towards her, leading little Miss Herbert by the hand. She rose up, and came to meet them, some of the children still clinging to her, and impeding her progress. â\\x80\\x98 Let me go, dears,â\\x80\\x99 she whispered ; try 172 ing to disengage herself from their grasp. But the children, their heads full of the176 THWARTED ; OR, announcement she had just made them, clung tighter to her, crying, â\\x80\\x98 No, no, you mustnâ\\x80\\x99t go. Stay with us.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m not going aw r ay,â\\x80\\x99 she said soothingly ; â\\x80\\x98 only just going to speak to the little lady.â\\x80\\x99 They relaxed their hold after this, though they kept their eyes upon her rather fear 172 fully. Little Miss Herbert had been an attentive observer of the scene. â\\x80\\x98 How fond they seem of her ! â\\x80\\x99 she said to Bill. Then, leaving go of his hand, she ran forward to Bessie, and said, â\\x80\\x98 William Tarver says you teach them their geography. I want to hear them do it.â\\x80\\x99 Bessie wondered Bill should have picked out that particular branch of study for display, as the infantsâ\\x80\\x99 knowledge of it was of course of the most limited order. â\\x80\\x98They do very little of that, Miss,â\\x80\\x99 sheducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a iienâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 177 answered ; â\\x80\\x98 theyâ\\x80\\x99re such little things ; but you shall hear what they can do. Bill, will you get Miss Herbert a chair ? â\\x80\\x99 Bill placed a seat by his sister, and then slipped away without speaking. He was eager to get back to his work while the inspiration by which he was seized, was still upon him. Bessie gathered her little class around her, and put them through a few simple questions. They acquitted themselves very well. Little Miss Herbert sat perched upon her chair, listening attentively ; and then looked up plaintively at Bessie with her great eyes. â\\x80\\x98I wish somebody would teach me as nicely as that,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s more like play than lessons.â\\x80\\x99 The young teacher smiled. â\\x80\\x98You shall178 THWARTED ; OR, see them at play now, Miss. They play and sing at the same time.â\\x80\\x99 The infants were soon arranged in a circle, and went through the â\\x80\\x98 Peasant â\\x80\\x99 with its accompanying gesticulations. The little girlâ\\x80\\x99s delight knew no bounds ; she got nearer and nearer, and at last joined the ring herself. The sudden advent of a new and undis ciplined scholar was too much for the infants. Eules were forgotten, and the game finished in wild disorder. Bessie was glad to see the children o had forgotten their troubles ; and left them to enjoy themselves unrebuked for a time. But the hour for dismissal was at hand, and she called them to order at last. Beckoning Miss Herbert to her side, she made the infants march past her, twoducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs ik a hexâ\\x80\\x99s xest. 179 and two ; curtsying or bowing as they passed 011 their way out. Very regretfully the young teacherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes followed each little couple as they disap 172 peared ; and as the tiny child she had had on her lap trotted off in charge of an elder brother of five, they filled with tears. She felt it all too probable she should never superintend their little games again. She shook off her depression, and turned to the little lady at her side. The child was gazing almost as mourn 172 fully at the open door by which the children had disappeared. The room seemed so for 172 lorn, so deserted : the silence they had left behind them was so great. â\\x80\\x98 Oh dear ! oh dear ! â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed ; â\\x80\\x98 I wish they hadnâ\\x80\\x99t gone. I havenâ\\x80\\x99t had such a game for years and years ! What fun it was, and what happy little children they180 THWARTED ; OR, must be ! I wish I was a little poor child, and could come and do my lessons at the Infant School with you. You do it so nicely, and never stop them if they make a little noise, do you ? â\\x80\\x99 Bessie sighed. â\\x80\\x98 No, Miss Herbert, I like to make them love their little lessons. Itâ\\x80\\x99s what makes me happier than anything.â\\x80\\x99 Just then came a knock at the door, and a white scared face looked in. A voice uttered an exclamation of relief and satisfaction, and the coachman, who had been riding with Miss Herbert, appeared in the doorway. The child, he told Bessie, had given him the slip while he had been shutting a gate : and he had not been able to make up his mind which of three roads she had taken. Of course he had picked out the wrong one ; but finding out his mistake, he had turnedDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A henâ\\x80\\x99s NEST. 181 back, and liad tracked her to the School- house, where the sight of the riderless pony had filled him with alarm. â\\x80\\x98 Please come home now, Missie,â\\x80\\x99 he pleaded. â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s long past your tea-time, and your mamma will be getting so uneasy and anxious.â\\x80\\x99 The child stood up, and looked round. â\\x80\\x98 Whereâ\\x80\\x99s William Tarver ? â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98 I want to say good-bye to him.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 He has gone home long-ago,â\\x80\\x99 Bessie answered. â\\x80\\x98 Heâ\\x80\\x99s very unkind,â\\x80\\x99 she said plaintively ; â\\x80\\x98 he never will say good-bye.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98He is so busy just now,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie, apologetically ; â\\x80\\x98 he hasnâ\\x80\\x99t a minute to spare from his work.â\\x80\\x99 The little creature seemed mollified by this explanation, and condescended to be led to the door, and to mount her pony. â\\x80\\x98 I182 THWARTED ; OR, shall soon be back again,â\\x80\\x99 she called out to Bessie as she gallopped off, â\\x80\\x98 to see you make the children play and sing. Soon, very soon! â\\x80\\x99 The little figure with its streaming hair disappeared in the distance ; the echo of the ponyâ\\x80\\x99s clattering hoofs died away: and silence and sadness settled down again on the young teacherâ\\x80\\x99s heart. She returned into the empty school-room, now doubly quiet and deserted ; and she shook her head as she half-unconsciously re 172 peated the childâ\\x80\\x99s parting words. â\\x80\\x98 You will never see that any more,â\\x80\\x99 she murmured ; â\\x80\\x98 that is all over now.â\\x80\\x99 She put on her bonnet, and after taking a farewell glance at the familiar scene of her past labours, she walked slowly and sadly home. When the dusk came on, Bill, who till then had toiled full of hope and inspiration felt the design was once more fading fromducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 183 him ; and, as the light grew fainter, his heart grew fainter too. He threw aside his knife, and strove to recall the events of the afternoon, hoping that the feeling of inspiration might return with them. And as he sat thus in the gloaming, half asleep and very dreamy, they came back in a strange medley to his mind. He was sitting, like Dick Whittington, on a milestone, only by the school-house door. The air was full of music, and a band of little voices sang. Close by was the fairy child, leaning against a table, stretching out her hand. And on the table stood the box. Something the child was saying, which he longed and strained to hear. And as he gazed upon her, she opened her lips and sang :â\\x80\\x94184 THWARTED. If you find you donâ\\x80\\x99t succeed, Try, try, try again. Whether he had slept or no, he knew not, but when he took up his knife again the difficulty had vanished away.CHAPTER XI.

And now the day was rapidly approach 172 ing when the contributions to the Exhibition must be sent to Bournby. He put the finishing touches to his work; and prepared to exhibit it to his mother, before packing it up. Not that she had shown any more interest in it as time went on. From first to last she had continued to manifest the same indifference. He and Bessie decided to put it on a little table ; so as to make it look as much as possible like its fellow at the Big188 THWARTED ; OR, House ; and then Mrs. Tarver was to be called in, to give her opinion. The morning of the day on which this little plot was to be carried out, Bessie and her mother were hard at work in the wash 172 house, when a message came from the Big House, to say that Mrs. Herbert wished to see Mrs. Tarver immediately. So unusual a summons filled the widow with surprise, not unmingled with a little indignation. â\\x80\\x98 Why couldnâ\\x80\\x99t she have waited till the evening, instead of making one dress up in the middle of the day ! â\\x80\\x99 she wrathfully ex 172 claimed, as she withdrew her arms from the soap-suds in which they were plunged, and went upstairs to change her gown. In about half-an-hour she returned, flushed and breathless, with radiant face, and eyes sparkling with excitement. â\\x80\\x98 Good news ! â\\x80\\x99 she called out to Bessieducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A hexâ\\x80\\x99s xest. 189 and Bill, who met her at the door ; â\\x80\\x98 wonder 172 ful news, I can hardly believe it yet !

Let me sit down, Bill, for Iâ\\x80\\x99m quite upset with the suddenness-like of the thing.â\\x80\\x99 Bessieâ\\x80\\x99s heart was beating so with surprise and delight, that she could not steady her voice to make any remark. She placed a chair for her mother in silence ; for Bill was too excited to take any notice of the widowâ\\x80\\x99s request for a seat. â\\x80\\x98 Go on, mother,â\\x80\\x99 he exclaimed ; â\\x80\\x98 donâ\\x80\\x99t stop. Tell us all about it from the very beginning. Donâ\\x80\\x99t leave out a word.â\\x80\\x99190 THWARTED ; OR, Mrs. Tarver went on to say that ever since the little girlâ\\x80\\x99s visit to the school, she had been imploring that she might be allowed to go and learn there with the little children ; or at least that if that were denied her, she might have Elizabeth to teach her at home. Mrs. Herbert had at first treated the childâ\\x80\\x99s request as a passing fancy : but finding it repeated day after day, she had at last taken it into consideration. She had feared there were great difficulties in the way ; because she had not understood that Bessie no longer attended the school ; and she had assured the child Bessie would never consent to give up her place. Wearied, however, by the little girlâ\\x80\\x99s persistency, and unaccustomed to have to cross her in anyway, she had at last determined to send for the widow, and to seeducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 191 if an arrangement of any kind could be effected. Her joy at finding everything so smooth and easy had been great ; and she had made her own terms at once.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s a wonderful bit of good fortune, sureâ\\x80\\x94ly ! â\\x80\\x99 Bessie presented herself before the invalid lady at the appointed hour. To play with the little girl, and keep her amused and happy while Mrs. Herbert was upstairs ; to introduce a little teaching, if possible, but on no account to bother the child with lessons : such were the injunctions delivered to her in a feeble slightly querulous tone : and she willingly promised obedience.192 THWARTED ; OR, The girlâ\\x80\\x99s face bore such evident tokens of happiness in the arrangement, that the invalid paused, and looked at her with languid surprise. â\\x80\\x98 Youâ\\x80\\x99re fond of teaching then, I suppose,â\\x80\\x99 she said, eyeing her curiously and half en 172 viously. â\\x80\\x98 Oh yes, Ma â\\x80\\x99am,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie ; â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve missed it so since I left the school, and it makes me so happy to think of beginning again. Iâ\\x80\\x99m only sorry to think. . . .â\\x80\\x99 She hesitated, checked by the expression of Mrs. Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s face. â\\x80\\x98 Sorry to think what ? â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed the invalid helplessly. â\\x80\\x98 Oh dear me ! I hope there are not going to be any objections, just as I thought it was all arranged.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Objections ! â\\x80\\x99 repeated Bessie, clasping her hands ; â\\x80\\x98 how could I make objections to anything ! Oh no, Ma â\\x80\\x99am. You misunder-ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 193 stand me altogether.

It makes me so sadly nervous.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Nervous ! â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie, puzzled. But Mrs. Herbert held up her hand warningly ; for the child had entered the room. â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99re going to be my governess, ain\\'t \\' you ? â\\x80\\x99 she said, bounding up to Bessie ; 6 and youâ\\x80\\x99ll teacli me all those nice games and songs with the jumping and clapping of hands ? â\\x80\\x99 4 1 hope there wonâ\\x80\\x99t be a great deal of noise,â\\x80\\x99 said the invalid nervously. Bessie reassured her on that point, and194 THWARTED ; OR, then rose to take her leave. The child followed her down stairs, talking all the way. â\\x80\\x98 Do you think youâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to make me like my lessons ? â\\x80\\x99 she asked, â\\x80\\x98 because mammy canâ\\x80\\x99t. But then, you see, she isnâ\\x80\\x99t nice and merry over them like you are, and she canâ\\x80\\x99t bear me to make any noiseâ\\x80\\x94not the least little bit of noise. I think I could do them so much better if I might make just a little. She gets a head-ache directly. You donâ\\x80\\x99t have head-aches, do you ? â\\x80\\x99 she said, suddenly stopping short on the stairs, and looking with horror into Bessieâ\\x80\\x99s face. â\\x80\\x98 No, never, Miss Herbert,â\\x80\\x99 smiled Bessie ; â\\x80\\x98 and Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure I shall be able to make you like your lessons. We shall have such happy times together, you and I ! â\\x80\\x99 The child fairly laughed with delight ; and repeatedly kissed her hand to Bessie, as she stood watching her off from the hallducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 195 door. 4 Come very early to-morrow,â\\x80\\x99 she called out ; â\\x80\\x98 come very early and stay very late ! â\\x80\\x99 Bessie kissed her hand in answer, and sped merrily home. That evening the box was put on a little table in Billâ\\x80\\x99s den, with a candle on each side of it. After admiring it for a minute, Bessie went in search of her mother, and told her Bill had got something to show her in his room. 4 The widow came in ; and her son and daughter watched her countenance eagerly. But to their dismay, the moment her eye lighted on the box, she started as if she had seen a spectre ; and then looked much agitated. 4 Now, Bill ! â\\x80\\x99 she said harshly, 4 what o 2196 THWARTED ; OR, trick is this you are playing me ?

Do you think I could be deceived about that box ? It came off the table that stands in the window in the little library.â\\x80\\x99 She was working herself into a state of incontrollable agitation ; and Bill hastily ex 172 plained. But the explanation seemed only toDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IN\\' A HEXâ\\x80\\x99S NEST. 197 agitate her more ; and, at last, she fairly ran out of the room. â\\x80\\x98 Now, Bessie,â\\x80\\x99 said Bill, turning to his sister, â\\x80\\x98what new mystery is this? How can the box at the Big House be any way connected with my motherâ\\x80\\x99s past life, that the sight of my copy should upset her in this way ? â\\x80\\x98 Perhaps,â\\x80\\x99 suggested Bessie, â\\x80\\x98 going to the Big House so soon after fatherâ\\x80\\x99s death, any 172 thing she was accustomed to see then recalls her grief to her.â\\x80\\x99 Bill was not satisfied with the explana 172 tion, but agreed with his sister that it might be so. â\\x80\\x98 At any rate,â\\x80\\x99 he said, * I may console myself with the thought of mother having mistaken my box for the original. It shows it must be more like than I imagined.â\\x80\\x99 The next day he walked with it to the station, and saw it off by the train.CHAPTER XII. THE BON-BON BOX.CHAPTER XII. Bessie began her tuition at the Big House on the following morning. Bill, for the next few clays, worked in the garden, and did what he could to help his mother, while he waited for news from Bournby. The suspense made him very restless. Sometimes, he was full of hope ; at others, he told himself he had been over-sanguine. The 7 tli of April came and passed : and now Bill began to look for every post from Bournby, and his heart would beat as the hour drew near.202 THWARTED ; OR, 4 We might very easily hear to-day,â\\x80\\x99 he said to Bessie as he walked with her to the Big House on the morning of the 10th- 4 1 feel very hopeful somehow, this morning, Bess. Something seems to tell me everything will turn out well. Perhaps it is because it is such a beautiful day,â\\x80\\x99 he added, stopping short, and looking round at the green fields full of little lambs, the banks covered with primroses, the ground blue with wild hyacinths ; the sun shining brightly upon all. Bessie stopped too, enjoying with him the beauty of the spring morning. They stood listening for some minutes to the glad song of a hundred birds around them, and the soft sound of the cuckoo in the distance. 4 Good-bye, dear Bill,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie, when they reached the Big House door. 4 Come and meet me after your dinner, for I shall beducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 203 panting to know if you have had any news.â\\x80\\x99 She stood for a moment watching him as he disappeared down the lane, marking with sisterly pride his tall slight figure, and the erect carriage of his head. â\\x80\\x98 Heâ\\x80\\x99s meant for something great, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure,â\\x80\\x99 she said fondly. â\\x80\\x98 Cuckoo ! â\\x80\\x99 sounded close by, from the top of one of the trees in the garden. It seemed to her to come like an amen to the words she had just uttered ; and she smiled brightly as she entered the house. â\\x80\\x98 Mrs. Herbert would like to see you in about an hourâ\\x80\\x99s time, in her bedroom,â\\x80\\x99 said the servant who opened the door. The summons was unusual, for hitherto Bessie had rarely seen the invalid lady. Her little pupil was not able to tell her why she was wanted ; but in the course oÃ\\xad conversation observed, that â\\x80\\x98 Mammy had204 THWARTED ; OR, had a letter from Aunt Mary at Bournby this morning.â\\x80\\x99 The news made Bessieâ\\x80\\x99s heart beat, and rendered her restless and pre-occupied. She found herself watching the clock, and long 172 ing for the moment to come when she should present herself before Mrs. Herbert. It came at last, and with some trepida 172 tion Bessie went upstairs, and knocked at the bedroom door. â\\x80\\x98 Come in,â\\x80\\x99 said a weak, rather trembling voice ; and Bessie entered. The invalid was lying on the sofa in her dressing-gown, with an open letter in her hand. â\\x80\\x98 Pray sit down,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a letter from my sister-in-law at Bournby this morning, which has puzzled me rather, and I think you can help me.â\\x80\\x99 Bessie sat down. â\\x80\\x98It seems they have had one of theseducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A hexâ\\x80\\x99s XEST. 205 Industrial Exhibitions there ; and that the prize for carving lias been gained by your brother.â\\x80\\x99 Bessie clasped her hands with delight, and grew crimson to the roots of her hair. The invalid looked rather uneasy. â\\x80\\x98 This is news to you, I sec,â\\x80\\x99 she said ; â\\x80\\x98 yes, itâ\\x80\\x99s very pleasant for you ; but donâ\\x80\\x99t agitate yourself, my good girl. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not very strong this morning. That wasnâ\\x80\\x99t the point of what I was going to say. My sister-in-law says he is a most promising young man ; and that the foreman of a great church decoration shop in London, who happened to be at the Exhibition, declares his contribution shows very rare talent. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll be pleased to hear this . . . yes .... but I have not got to the point yet. It seems your brother has contributed a carved antique bcx, which he206 THWARTED ; OR, has done from memory, after seeing the original once : and when questioned as to where he saw it, he answered in the Big House at Grinfield ! that is, here ! in my house ! I canâ\\x80\\x99t understand it at all ; and itâ\\x80\\x99s made me so nervous.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 I think I can explain, maâ\\x80\\x99am,â\\x80\\x99 said Bessie. 4 My brother waited here one day for a message in the little library, and there he saw the box.â\\x80\\x99 The invalid looked a little happier, but was evidently only partially relieved. â\\x80\\x98 That is not all, you see,â\\x80\\x99 she said. 4 The worst part is that the Committee say itâ\\x80\\x99s such a beautiful bit of carving that my sister-in- law has been desired to write and ask me where I got the original box : and she wants an answer by return of post. The very idea of a Committee makes me so nervous that I canâ\\x80\\x99t collect my thoughts at all.â\\x80\\x99ducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A hexâ\\x80\\x99s xest. 207 Here the child slipped in, and sat down on the foot of the sofa. â\\x80\\x98 I canâ\\x80\\x99t think what box it can be,â\\x80\\x99 said . the invalid, helplessly. â\\x80\\x98 Perhaps Miss Herbert could help you,â\\x80\\x99 suggested Bessie ; and with the motherâ\\x80\\x99s per 172 mission, she explained to the little girl the subject under discussion. â\\x80\\x98 It must be my bon-bon box,â\\x80\\x99 said the child. 4 Your bon-bon box ! â\\x80\\x99 repeated the poor lady, uneasily. 4 What bon-bon box ? I canâ\\x80\\x99t remember anything to-day. The letter coming so early, and the flurry of having to answer it so early, and the Committee, and altogether, have confused me terribly. Petch the box, my darling pet, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a dear, good, obedient little girl.â\\x80\\x99 The child ran off eagerly, and Bessie followed her downstairs, and into the208 THWARTED ; OR, little library, and â\\x80\\x98up to the table in the window. When Bessieâ\\x80\\x99s eyes fell upon the box, she was struck dumb with astonishment at, the accuracy of Billâ\\x80\\x99s copy. It seemed to her as if this were the very same she had seen gradually grow under his hand at home. Her heart was beating with hope and excitement as she carried it upstairs : but she was forced to control herself on account of the invalid lady. â\\x80\\x98 Iâ\\x80\\x99m so afraid even now of not being able to give any account of it,â\\x80\\x99 the nervous voice was saying as Bessie and the child entered the room. â\\x80\\x98 I feel as if I was being cross-examined in a witness-box. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a most disagreeable affair altogether.â\\x80\\x99 But the moment her eyes lighted on the box, she exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98 That box ! Dear me ! Why, that box was sold to me years and years ago, by your mother ! â\\x80\\x99ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 209 â\\x80\\x98 By my mother ! â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Bessie. â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99she said. â\\x80\\x98 Donâ\\x80\\x99t be excitedâ\\x80\\x94please ! â\\x80\\x98 Itâ\\x80\\x99s very simple. When she came to be my laundrymaid, or rather when she left to set up for herself, I bought it of her out of charity.â\\x80\\x99 The invalid lay back on the sofa and gave a great sigh of relief ; as much as to fD O O say the responsibility rested now on the shoulders of another, and that she washed her hands of it. Bessie meanwhile was so bewildered that she stood staring at Mrs. Herbert vacantly, trying to put her thoughts into shape. The invalid writhed under her gaze. â\\x80\\x98 You had better go home to your mother, and make enquiries. Look, take the letter with you and let her read it. Bring it, and the answer, back before post-time, that I may write to my sister-in-law this afternoon.210 THWARTED ; OR, And now I think Iâ\\x80\\x99ll try and get a little sleep before lunch.â\\x80\\x99 Bessie got up, too glad to make her escape, so great was her longing to see Bill. She put on her things hastily, and took a short cut across the garden into the lane. She sped along the road on the wings of the wind, and never halted till she reached the cottage door. â\\x80\\x98 Bill ! â\\x80\\x99 she cried joyfully. But there was no answer, and no one seemed to be at home. â\\x80\\x98 Bill ! â\\x80\\x99 she cried, crossing the kitchen, and she opened the door of his little room. But the room was empty : there was no one there. Bessie was completely mystified, she could not make it out. In her motherâ\\x80\\x99s bedroom were signs of a hasty departure ; her week-day dress layDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A IIEKâ\\x80\\x99S NEST. 211 on the bed, and the cupboard containing her Sunday clothes was empty. It was the same in Billâ\\x80\\x99s room. What could have happened ! Where could they both have gone ! And where was Charlie? For it was past twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock, so he must have come home from school. It was so strange that they should have gone off so suddenly, with 172 out leaving a message or a letter for her. But though she searched everywhere she found no letter of explanation, 110 clue to their sudden departure. It was so odd that they should not have sent her a message by Charlie. It was very mysterious, and altogether most disappointing when she had so much to tell. She sat down feeling quite distressed, when quick footsteps fell upon her ear ; and r 2212 THWARTED ; OR, running to the door, she encountered Charlie, with a telegram in his hand. â\\x80\\x98 Hurrah ! â\\x80\\x99 he shouted ; â\\x80\\x98 here you are ; I canâ\\x80\\x99t think how I missed you. Such news, Bess ! Billâ\\x80\\x99s got the prize, and heâ\\x80\\x99s been sent for to Bournby. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been all the way to the Big House to tell you ; and you had just gone. Look here ! Bead it.â\\x80\\x99 Bessie took the telegram, and eagerly opened it. It was addressed to Bill, from his uncle, it was as follows :â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98 You have got the prize. Come to Bournby by next train, and bring anything else you have ever carved with you. All expenses will be paid.â\\x80\\x99 Charlie then told her that Bill had only just had time to get his things together, and to start. He had borrowed a cart from a neighbour, or else he could not have caught the train. He had been very sorry not toDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A henâ\\x80\\x99s NEST. 213 be able to see Bessie before he went, and had sent lier every kind of message. Their mother had gone with him to the station, to see him off, and to drive the cart home. Bessie decided to wait quietly till her mother returned ; as it was no use going back to Mrs. Herbert without an answer. She explained to Charlie that, in her haste, she had come out of the Big House by the front door, and taken a short cut across the garden, which accounted for her having missed him on the road. In due time the widow arrived, looking flushed, excited, and, as it were, triumphant in spite of herself. Bessie could tell her more than the telegram ; and the mother looked highly delighted at the mention of the foreman of the church decoration shop. But as the girl went on to deliver Mrs.214 THWARTED. Herbertâ\\x80\\x99s message, the widowâ\\x80\\x99s face changed. She turned away in some agitation, and answered sharply that Bessie need not return to the Big House, as she would go up her 172 self, and give the required answer. â\\x80\\x98 Wonâ\\x80\\x99t you tell me, mother? â\\x80\\x99 said poor Bessie wistfully. â\\x80\\x98 I may some day,â\\x80\\x99 was the reply, â\\x80\\x98 but it will not be till Bill comes home again.â\\x80\\x99CHAPTER XIII. THE MYSTERY CLEARED UP,CHAPTEB XIII. Two days after, the Bournby local paper arrived at the cottage, directed in Uncle Ned\\'s handwriting. The account of the Industrial Exhibition was scored on each side with ink, and one passage in particular deeply underlined. It related to the fact of the prize for carving having been gained by the son of a poor washerwoman ; who had never received any instruction, or even had proper tools to work with, in his life. Bessie had the pleasure of reading this paragraph out loud to her jnother and Charlie.218 THWARTED ; OR, The widowâ\\x80\\x99s face was a study during the reading. An expression of would-be indif 172 ference struggled with maternal pride on her countenance ; and though she affected not to be listening with any great interest, and went on ironing all the time, she did not really lose a word. More than once Bessie ob 172 served with delight that the iron remained poised in the air, while her motherâ\\x80\\x99s whole attitude denoted rapt attention. Bessie was a little disappointed at not receiving a letter from Bill by the same post ; but before she had time to wonder why he had not written, arrived Bill himself! And such a radiant, triumphant Bill that Bessie often declared afterwards, she hardly knew him again the first moment. For he seemed to have grown in those few days at least half an inch taller, and several years older, so erect was the carriage of his head,ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 219 and so full of life and self-dependence liis whole demeanour. And well might it be so ! For he had attained the height of his ambition : his hopes and his longings were fulfilled. The foreman of the church decoration shop had at once engaged him as a work 172 man ; and at a rate of wages which would not only support Bill himself, but leave a surplus for him to send to his mother. Nor was this all. His carving had been unanimously declared to be something quite out of the common ; and the foreman had assured him that if he went on as he had begun, he would in time make a name and a fortune. When Bill had recounted to his delighted audience thus far, he suddenly wheeled round to his mother and looked her full in the face.220 THWARTED ; OR, â\\x80\\x98 Little Mother,â\\x80\\x99 he said gently, â\\x80\\x98 where did you get the box which has been the means of so much ? It is declared to be a most accurate copy of Gibbons : and they say that it must actually have been copied from a certain bit of his work well known to be in the possession of a certain English nobleman. The Committee wrote to Mrs. Herbert to ask her how she came by it, and her answer was,â\\x80\\x99 . . . â\\x80\\x98 That she bought it of me,â\\x80\\x99 interrupted the widow, hurriedly. â\\x80\\x98 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what she said. I dictated the answer myself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 returned Bill ; â\\x80\\x98 and now the Committee desire me to put the same question to you. That that box is connected with our past life, and with all that you have hitherto concealed from us, I feel sure. And now, mother, you must unfold this double mystery to us. The time for an ex-ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a iienâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 221 planatioii has come, and you must withhold it no longer.â\\x80\\x99 He spoke with a mixture of tenderness and authority, but in a very determined way. And then added, as if in explanation of his tone, â\\x80\\x98 My grandfather offered to tell me all that I wanted to know, but I said I would hear it from my mother alone.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 There is no further need of concealment,â\\x80\\x99 cried the widow. â\\x80\\x98 I will tell you all. The box was carved by your father ! â\\x80\\x99 4 By our father ! â\\x80\\x99 they all exclaimed ; and Bill sprang to his feet in violent excite 172 ment. 4 Yes,â\\x80\\x99 she said, half-proudly, half mourn 172 fully. 4 Billâ\\x80\\x99s talent, children, is inherited ; for your father was a carver too ! â\\x80\\x99 They pressed her with questions till she told them they were the children of Wilhelm222 THWARTED ; OR, Tarver, a younger son in a highly respected German family ; who had left his fatherland, and come as an adventurer to England to make a name and a fortune by his talent ; both of which he had utterly tailed in doing. â\\x80\\x98 But why ? â\\x80\\x99 burst forth Bill, â\\x80\\x98 why did he fail ? With such a wonderful talent as his, how could he fail ? â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98 Ah, Bill ! â\\x80\\x99 she answered; 4 you are young, and know little of the difficulties of life. You seem to think everything is possible, and everything is easy. But I know more about the struggles and the obstacles on the way than you do. However, I will tell you his history and mine, from the beginning to the endâ\\x80\\x94and then you shall judge for your 172 self.â\\x80\\x99 She sighed deeply, as if the plunge into the past which she was about to make were a pain and a grief to her, and then began :â\\x80\\x94ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a iienâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 223 â\\x80\\x98 I was not quite seventeen when I first saw your father. â\\x80\\x98 I remember that evening as if it were yesterday. â\\x80\\x98 It had been a piping hot day, and I was standing at my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s cottage door, enjoy 172 ing the breeze that had just sprung up, when I saw in the distance a figure coming along the road. â\\x80\\x98A tall slight stranger, to look at just such another as Bill is now. Though he was limping with fatigue, and was covered with dust, I could see he was no tramp, even all that long way off ; and when he came nearer, I fell to wondering who he could be ; for there was a something about him different to the men Iâ\\x80\\x99d been used to see.â\\x80\\x99 When he got up to the cottage, he stopped, took off his hat, and said to me in a faint voice, in a kind of224 THWARTED ; OR, broken English, â\\x80\\x9c I am very weary : would you be so good to give me a glass of water ? â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 Hearing voices, my father came out, and he stayed talking to the stranger while I went to get the water. When I came back, I found father had brought him in, and was letting him rest in the kitchen. He took the water and drank it eagerly ; but in rising to put down the mug on the table, he put his hands to his head, and swooned away. The long and the short of it was, he had had a sun-stroke. We sent for the doctor, and he said he must not move from our house. He was very ill for a long time, and my mother and I nursed him between us. â\\x80\\x98 As he grew better, he told us his history. He had left his native land to escape the conscription, thereby deeply offending his father, for the Tarvers were a family of soldiers, and had been for genera-ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a iienâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 225 tions. Hundreds of liis countrymen, he told us, were every day leaving Germany for the same reason, and emigrating to Australia and America ; but he preferred to come to Eng 172 land, to work his way to fame. â\\x80\\x98 Ilis father had, however, given him his portion of the inheritance, and with this little fortune in his bag, he was going to London. Ile called it a little fortune ; but to us poor folk it seemed large. â\\x80\\x98 When he was well enough to go, he O O 3 asked me to come with him. He said I was strong and brave, and that he wanted such a O 7 wife as I should make, to be his right-hand and hclp-meet in the life he was going to begin. â\\x80\\x98 I had learned to love him : so gentle and so grateful as he Avas, who could help it ! and I said I Avould folloAv him to the worldâ\\x80\\x99s end. Q226 THWARTED ; OR, My father and mother didnâ\\x80\\x99t like it ; but they didnâ\\x80\\x99t know how to say no, for they saw my mind was made up, and they knew they should never be able to turn me from my purpose : and so we were married. We didnâ\\x80\\x99t go straight to London. There was some beautiful carving at a house he knew of near Stamford ; and he had set his heart on seeing it. â\\x80\\x98 So we went to Stamford ; and from there made an expedition to see this carving. â\\x80\\x98 I mind the day well, and no wonder, for it Avas the happiest I ever spent ; and often in the dark days that came after, itâ\\x80\\x99s eased my sore heart to look back upon it. â\\x80\\x98 It Avas a glorious summer day in the middle of June : avc dressed ourselves in our Sunday best, and Avent off together to Burghl ey. â\\x80\\x98 We sauntered all along the shady avenueducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 227 that leads to the house, laughing and talking, and listening to the birds ; and we were very happy. And we came to the grand old house, and were let in ; for it was a visitorâ\\x80\\x99s day. And we walked through the grand rooms and passages, till we came to one where the walls were covered with carving ; and he stopped short in delight, and stood staring up at it like a mad thing, talking to himself in German. â\\x80\\x98 It didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem much to me ; not half so well worth looking at as the beautiful carpets and curtains, and other things in the room. And I wanted him to come and look at them instead ; but I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t get him to move, and he said something about a Mr. Gibbs or Gibbins or some such person. (I havenâ\\x80\\x99t heard the name since, Bill, till you mentioned it just now.) And he sat down opposite it, and took out a pencil, and began to draw. a 2228 THWARTED ; OR, I sat down too, and talked to him all the time ; and w r e spent a happy hour in the quiet cool room. It has been something, children, as I said before, to have the memory of such a day as that to turn to in all the dark times that come after. And now you know why I love that carved box so well. For on the lid is the bit of carving that recalls that day to my mind. The sight of it even now gives me a kind of feeling of being young again, and brings along with it a sort of mixture of hope and happiness and sunshine ;â\\x80\\x94-just like a pot of mignonette in our dingy London lodging used to give me a whiff of my country home. I sold the box to Mrs. Herbert at last, to pay for the wash- tubs and things when I set up as a laundress. It didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem like parting with it altogether ; for I thought I should see it now and again O C 1 at the Big House.ducks\\' eggs in a henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 229 â\\x80\\x98 Well ! the rest of that day we wandered about the beautiful park, and the day after we went on to London.â\\x80\\x99 The widow stopped, and sighed. How was she to tell Wilhelm Tarverâ\\x80\\x99s children of his faults, of his weak vacillating character, of his total want of industry and perseve 172 rance, of his idle selfish way of allowing her to toil and slave, while he took his ease, and worked or not, as it pleased him ? Of her disappointment in him as day by day her eyes opened more to his weak points ; of his netting orders for carving, and his O O O 3 either not executing them, or so delaying that his employers and customers, in disgust, by degrees fell away from him ? She softened all this as best she could, and dwelt more upon his want of strength ; and upon the over-stocked state of the trade in London.230 THWARTED ; OR, At last had come sickness, debt, and increased expenses after the births of the children. She herself had been unable to find time, between the care of a sick husband and a young family, to earn sufficient to pay the rent, and to provide food and clothing for them all : and the crash came. Shortly after Charlieâ\\x80\\x99s birth, the bailiffs entered the house ; and the whole family were obliged to go to the work-house. There her husband had died ; and she had then left London for ever. Was it a wonder, she passionately asked, as, overcome by the recollection of all the sad past, she sank upon a chair weeping bitterly, that, knowing from whom Bill in 172 herited his talent, she should have tried to keep him from the path that had proved such a pitfall to his father ?ducksâ\\x80\\x99 eggs in a iienâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 231 Her children, carried away by her story, and fdled with love and admiration for her conduct, were unanimous in assuring her thq.t she had indeed acted for the best. Tenderly they soothed and kissed her, and thanked her for all she had done. For though, in her recital, she had, while slurring over her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s weakness, equally passed over in silence her own heroic efforts, her own determined perseverance in work of every kind, by which means alone the final crash had been so long averted,â\\x80\\x94yet William and Elizabeth saw clearly enough how it had been. But the reader, who owes no filial rever 172 ence to the poor washerwoman, will see where she made a grievous mistake. She had laid all the blame of her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s failure in life, and the consequent ruin of his family, upon his talent instead of upon232 THWARTED. himself, and had not realised the difference in character between the father and the son. She had failed to see in Bill her own determined resolution and indomitable per 172 severance ; which, joined to the talent he had inherited from his father, would surely bring him the success which that father neither attained nor deserved. She had thwarted him in every possible way from his earliest childhood : but in the end she was thwarted herself. For, as we have seen, her intentions were frustrated, and her efforts over-ruled by a village Industrial Exhibition.CHARTER XIV. THE GREAT CARVERâ\\x80\\x99S GREATEST WORK.CHAPTER XIV. In a very little while, Bill started for London ; where his marvellous talent rapidly developed itself, and he as rapidly rose. He lost no time in communicating with his German relations, who were delighted to hear of his existence, and of that of the rest of the family. % They entreated him to come over and establish himself among them, as soon as he had made sufficient progress in his art to set up for himself. This Bill accordingly did ; and in the course of time was able to make a home23G TIIWAKTED ; OK, for Lis mother. He then wrote to his family to follow him. â\\x80\\x98 You shall never toil too hard any more, mother,â\\x80\\x99 he said ; â\\x80\\x98 but shall be mistress of my house, and do just as much or as little as you feel inclined. Charlie shall go to a military school, and follow out his wish to be a soldier. And tell Bessie there are plenty of little children here, and plenty of schools to teach them in ; so she may yet carry out her schemes, and gratify her old ambi 172 tions.â\\x80\\x99 The summons came just in time. Bessie, having implanted in her little pupil a love of learning, and llabits-of attention and industry, had for some time felt the childâ\\x80\\x99s education should now be confided to more skilful hands. The widow was longing for a little rest, for the strain of her hard life was beginning to tell upon her health ; and both motherDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A HEXâ\\x80\\x99S XEST. and daughter were pining for Bill, from whom they had never before been separated. Charlie, too, it need not be said, was enchanted at the prospect held out to him. They gladly obeyed it therefore, and were joyfully received by Bill in their Fatherland. There the poor widow led a happy life ; enjoying that immunity from care and tod which had never before been hers ; sur 172 rounded by her children and her grand 172 children, and proudly watching her Wil 172 helmâ\\x80\\x99s success. There Karl in due time had his dreams fulfilled ; for he joined the Prussian army, and became a distinguished soldier. And there Elizabeth found the hopes held out to her in Billâ\\x80\\x99s letter fully realised : for, as years went on, she gathered little children round her knee once more.238 THWARTED ; OR, But her old schemes she relinquished, and her ambitions ran to waste ; for these children called her â\\x80\\x98 mother,â\\x80\\x99 and they were her very own ! And so the family of Tarver passed away from the village of Grinfield, not even leaving their name behind. For fifteen years they had lived thereâ\\x80\\x94 did no trace of their sojourn remain P Nayâ\\x80\\x94but we cannot live anywhere for so long without leaving our mark : our o o influence for evil or for good. So, though the laundress was gone for ever, the memory of her industry remained. Her hard-working perseverance, her energy, and her determination are still talked of at Grinfield, are still held up as a pattern to the young.

And William Tarver, the boy who so deeply deplored the evils existing at Grin- field ; what mark did he leave upon it ? what influence of his was left behind him to work any change P When he quitted the village, it was just what he had always known itâ\\x80\\x94neglected, uncared for, and devoid of every kind of ad 172 vantage. But by and by, as years went on, great changes and improvements began to be seen. Flower-shows, night-schools, penny-read- ings and book-clubs were established : gra 172 dually the village lost its neglected appear 172 ance ; the population improved â\\x80\\x94 grew cleaner, tidier, more civilised, and conse 172 quently more prosperous.240 THWARTED ; OR, In due time, a young active clergyman succeeded the poor broken-down old rector : the church was restored, and the services were more frequent. Houses were built in the village ; it spread. A local railway in time was estab 172 lished, and a little station was built on the site of the Tarversâ\\x80\\x99 home. But what has all this to do with Bill ? Simply that this is his work : this the mark he has left behind. Not that he has done it knowingly, or by the force of his own will. Toiling away in his German studio, Grinfield has almost faded from his mind. His has been that indirect influence which is such a wonderful power in the world. These glorious fruits have sprung from seed unconsciously sown by his hand.ducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A hexâ\\x80\\x99s xest. 241 Long, long ago, lie had sown it broad 172 cast in the heart of a little child. Not more deeply had the first sight of real art sunk into the soul of the artist than had his own passionate words of complaint and reproach sunk into the heart of that child. That far-away interview in the little library had done a double work. It had been his first insight into a world harmonious, a world of beauty and perfec 172 tion, lying somewhere beyond him, but yet not out of reach. It had been her first insight into a world discordant, a world of want and imperfection, lying around her, outside her door, at her very feet. Then had come to him an intuitive con viction that he had a part in that world of talent, and that he could play it well. Then had come to her a faint, a shadowy242 THWARTED ; OR, suspicion that she, or hers, might have a part to play, though all unplayed as yet, in the well-being of the world around her. The sight had sunk into his mind, touched the spring of inspiration, and deve 172 loped his hidden genius. The words had sunk into her heart, touched there the chords of love and pity, and set them vibrating for evermore. It took him but a few weeks to throw into shape the thoughts that haunted him, the vision of beauty that filled his brain ; and then his name was known for ever : for fame is more noisy than love. Eut it took her long years to throw into shape the thoughts that his words had set stirring ; the vision of things to be done, and good to be accomplished ; and no one heard of her : for love works silently, and asks for no reward.DUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IN\\' A henâ\\x80\\x99s NEST. 243 Though, his words had remained for a long while dormant in her childish breast ; only half understood at the time, and after 172 wards well-nigh forgotten ; yet their memory was never wholly extinguished. If it grew dim, they would be brought back to her by the scenes around, the sights by which she was daily surrounded. When she fled in terror on her pony when a drunken man drew nigh, she was silently learning the lesson those words were meant to teach. While the coachman wondered what made the child so pensive, when they passed the noisy public house, Billâ\\x80\\x99s com 172 plaints and reproaches were recurring to her. As years went on, she saw more clearly his implied reproach ; realised who was in fault, and where her duty lay ; made up her244 THWARTED ; OR, small mind early it should be as he had said, and that when she was older, she would work herself all the improvements that were so sorely needed. The resolution grew with her growth, and strengthened with her strength, abun 172 dantly fed by the meditation for which in her lonely child-life she had so much opportunity. In her long companionless rides, in the silent rooms at home before her invalid mother came down downstairs, in her quiet musings by the graves of her little brothers and sisters : for ever the same idea filled her mind; and, as she blossomed into woman 172 hood, the fruits of her resolution became apparent in the wonderful reformation we have described. So this was Wilhelm Tarverâ\\x80\\x99s greatest work after all !DUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IX A henâ\\x80\\x99s nest. 245 He would not say so : he would point to certain carved seats in a German cathedral, or to a beautiful font in one of the old churches, that is the admired of all be 172 holders : but we say no !

AFTER TEN YEARS.CHAPTER XV. And Bill, far away, carving his way literally and figuratively, to fame and fortune ; mount 172 ing step by step the ladder of success ; would still be recalled sometimes to that conversa 172 tion in the little library at Grinfield, albeit he was unaware of all that had sprung there 172 from. A little wistful face would peep out at him sometimes from amidst the ferns and foliage growing under his shaping hand. And whereas once the child would recall to him the carving he could not always re 172 member, so now the carving would recall to him the child he could never quite forget.250 THWARTED ; OR, The fairy form was so indelibly graven on his mind ; was so inseparably connected with his first glimpse of art ; was so interwoven with the beginning of his success. O O Was he likely to forget it P Still at times it stood beside him, with its little outstretched hand ; still the little face was uplifted, and the plaintive voice would cry, â\\x80\\x98 Why wonâ\\x80\\x99t you take my handP â\\x80\\x99 Still the great eyes, so puzzled and wist 172 ful, gazed out from the wild fair hair. He threw it into shape at last. A cherubâ\\x80\\x99s face, with that wondering ex 172 pression, began to grow one day under his hand. And as he carved the eyes and lips, and strove to give them the likeness he re 172 membered, he threw aside his tools, and burying as of old his head, so as to shut outDUCKSâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IN\\' A henâ\\x80\\x99s NEST. 251 his present surroundings, he listened for the little voice again. From the far past it must have reached him ; for his face was bright when he took up his chisel ; a few more strokes, a few more touches, and the face of the child was there ! From that day, all his cherubs bore the same face : and other artists wondered how he carved such speaking features with no live model near. He would smile, but would never say. However the expression might vary, the face remained the same. Sometimes the cherub was plaintive and peevish ; sometimes timid and shy. Sometimes he conjured it up laughing roguishly, beckoning with an invisible hand. At others, imperious and very determined, it insisted on having its way.252 THWARTED ; OR, But\\'\\'\\' the wistful, puzzled, and mournful expression was ever the one he preferred. And always, ere he caught it, he must go through the same ceremony again. He must close his eyes, and bury his head ; and strain his memory to the full. And when he has brought her beside him, he still must make her say, â\\x80\\x98Why wonâ\\x80\\x99t you take my hand? Is it because itâ\\x80\\x99s so sticky ?... Youâ\\x80\\x99re very, very par 172 ticular, ain\\'t you ? â\\x80\\x99 During one long hard winter at Grinfield, the villagers were observed to be remarkably busy. Men and boys were seen in their leisure hours toiling away with painting on wood, carving, and carpentering ; and the women and girls giving every spare moment to knitting and other kinds of work. That there was some special end in view,ducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A henâ\\x80\\x99s NEST. 253 it was easy to see ; and on Midsummer Day, the eighteenth birthday of Miss Herbert of the Big House, the mystery was solved. For on that day Grinfield held it first Industrial Exhibition ! Many were the contributions from every cottage in the neighbourhood, and wonder 172 fully pretty and ingenious were some of the articles displayed. But the greatest contribution of all, and the one of which the villagers were most proud, was a beautifully carved antique chair for the new chancel of the church ; which had been sent all the way from Ger 172 many, by Herr Wilhelm Tarver. Visitors to the Exhibition were told with just pride, that the contributor was one of the most celebrated carvers of the day ; and that he had been brought up at Grinfield. On the back of the chair was a profusion254 THWARTED ; OR, of flowers and foliage, which had almost the lightness of nature ; and from their midst peeped out a cherub, with a mass of tangled hair. There was something about the face of this cherub that attracted the attention of the villagers, besides its beauty as a work of art. Many gazed at it long, and returned to gaze again. It seemed to them familiar, and yet they knew not why. One or two thought they detected a like 172 ness ; but then, again, thought they were mistaken, and with a shake of the head, passed on. For to them Miss Herbert is a tall fair girl, with earnest eyes, and thoughtful brow ; a beautiful woman, whose presence alone brings rest and consolation, and whose voiceducksâ\\x80\\x99 EGGS IK A henâ\\x80\\x99s NEST. 255 and step are known and loved in every cottage home. Only to him will she always be a fairy child of seven ; a little queen of art and beauty ; a tiny creature stretching out her hand to him, with wondering eyes, and a mass of wild fair hair.

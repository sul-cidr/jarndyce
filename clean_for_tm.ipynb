me of that darling little inkpot dear cousin gave me on my birthday she alluded to vulgar little article price about half crown possibly not so much white hat of the shape you see on betting man head with an inkpot fitted inside dear cousin too the man above all others detested my birthday present to her was handsome pearl and diamond bracelet and she scarcely said thank you for it trust said addressing her in my gravest manner you do mean to compare me to an inkpot common inkpot why not you silly little man laughed my frivolous fiancée an inkpot in my opinion is very useful article and in this case ornamental so you ought to take it as compliment there was of course nothing more to be done except to obey orders and accordingly the next morning directly had swallowed my breakfast hied me to celebrated emporium for gentlemen head gear situated in regent street want hat said addressing smart shopman who came forward on my entrance into the shop the white hat certainly sir what description of may ask replied he washing his hands with invisible soap while he waited my answer white hat with black told him by all means said he with alacrity if you will excuse me will first just study your features for half minute so that we shall get at the most suitable shape of for your with that he fell back several paces and throw ing himself into contemplative attitude his chin supported by his hand gazed at me most intently with eye shut for fully two minutes felt myself getting quite hot and uncomfortable under the operation said he at the end of the inspection should like for the governor to have look at you sir if you have no objection you see sir he went on apologetically in our establish ment we do go on the principle of ordinary who say to themselves an an and an an on the contrary we look at our with the heyes of for hinstance where flat or harched brimmed suits one gent down to the ground it might look on another so saying he tripped gaily off to return imme diately with stout party all smiles and bows whom rightly guessed to be the governor as he called him he immediately proceeded to go through the same pantomime as his man thf white hat ing several steps he folded his arms and cocking his head as far on one side as ever his short neck would allow contracted his bushy eyebrows and stared fixedly at me for fully couple of minutes his man and he conversing in whispers all the time you wrong you are indeed said he after pause raising his voice for my benefit neither nor shapes would at all harmonise with this gentleman intellectual countenance the of continued he with shrug of the shoulders might have done had there been leetle more hair on the face as it is see nothing for it but the duke of shire own particular yes sir said the master of the shop addressing me this time after careful study of your features sir feel convinced that the only hat for you is one of the exact pattern as that worn by our kind patron his the duke of the same firm yet mobile expression about the mouth the same lofty forehead and expressive eye reach me down if you please his grace block and measure this gentleman at once for hat the exact pattern of the the exact pattern you understand measured was accordingly and think sir said the swell hatter as he bowed me out of the shop the result will be satisfactory to all parties white hat gave sigh of relief when got into the street for had never seen such fuss made about hat before in my life it was gratifying though very when came to think of it to be accused of bearing strong resemblance to real live duke found myself thinking as walked along whether by an chance of the duke of family might not have married into mine at some distant period if could only speak familiarly in the course of conversation of my cousins the downshires or mention casually goes to next week and fancy though am not quite sure mind that the duchess accompanies him would never dare to treat of the proud breed in the frivolous flippant manner it is now her pleasure to assume to me on all occasions well this important business having been con cluded wended my way to father house with view to luncheon was alone in the drawing room when got there and at once told her of my purchase she was condescending enough to say that it was very sweet of me not to forget her com mands hope though she added you bought nice looking badly shaped hat is too dreadful to contemplate have ordered replied proudly thethe duke of the white hat exact counterpart of his the duke of burst into shriek of laughter what she screamed did you buy an old hat of the duke for pattern or did you ask his man for it do tell me entirely fail to see the joke replied with some instability of manner as matter of fact went by chance to the duke hatter and he told me that possessed similar features to his and oh do cried it is too bad to make me laugh so much it makes fat they say but ca help it the idea of your fancying you are the least like the duke of shire you poor little thing what wretch that hatter must be why the duke is but could go any further sinking back on the sofa she buried her face in her handker chief and laughed until she cried attempted to speak but she waved her hand imploringly at last irritated beyond measure fled abruptly from the room muttering maledic tions on the duke of and the white hat as went two days later the the hat came home it was not of course to be publicly uncovered to the world until goodwood but could not resist taking it out of its bandbox and trying it on to see how it looked do you know io the white hat was greatly pleased with the effect the swell hatter was correct my head in that hat had distinct ducal appearance called my sisters to share my triumph they are friends of and nearly as frivolous as she is which is saying good deal short glance at me was quite sufficient for each flopped into chair clapped their hands and screamed with laughter oh the women must all be going mad thought made so bold as to inquire the cause of their hilarity oh exclaimed my eldest sister if you only had your face blacked and banjo in your hand you look exactly like that nigger minstrel we used to call we saw on the sands at last would he and she burst into verse of it is the lubly gal love and laughed louder than ever and oh said my other sister wiping her eyes you do look such snob such an my dear boy how could you buy such dreadful thing nigger minstrel named snob and an fellow nice people to be compared to certainly in vain mentioned incidentally that the duke of downshire wore similar hat to mine the white hat dukes they said of course could afford to wear what they liked that was all the comfort could get from them they retired from the room and heard them giggling and laughing for at least half an hour afterwards in their own room ah wait until you get new frock apiece my dears said to myself and if do pick hole or in it my name is what it is two days later took my departure for sea to join my her sisters and father who had preceded me some days and were all located at the queen hotel in that place as drove up in cab in the afternoon the steps of the hotel were covered with visitors including my fiancée and her family amongst whom noticed as the reporters say the detested cousin out jumped and the hotel porters at once proceeded to shoulder my luggage and take it to my room be very careful of that bandbox it contained the white hat said to of them it wo bear knocking about all right sir replied he take it up separate with that he took it in both hands and holding it at length in front of him in gingerly fashion as if there was cobra or some equally dangerous reptile inside he ran up the hotel the white hat remember upset some salt that morning at breakfast and omitted to throw some over my left shoulder and that is the only way can account for that porter suddenly falling down as if he was shot at the second step he was heavy man and he fell with all his weight plump on to the bandbox what the looked like afterwards the reader can readily imagine for moment could articulate for anger and it was not until the porter had risen and addressed me that found words all right sir said he as he rubbed the dust off himself not much hurt and only knocked my helber bit not much hurt indeed roared out in my wrath you stupid idiot should have cared if you had broken your confounded neck open the box directly and see for yourself the damage you have done the obese porter did as he was bid and opened the and as thought there was the facsimile of the duke of favourite chapeau flattened out into the shape of gibus opera hat the porter putting his hand inside essayed to straighten it out as he termed it and succeeded in converting it into very good likeness of concertina never shall forget the shout of laughter that arose from the party on the steps as the brute held my poor hat up for general inspection as the white hat were and the hated laughing the loudest of all could stand it no longer snatching the damaged hat from out of the porter hand threw it from me into the middle of the street giving the astonished porter at the same time shove that once more sent him to mother earth on his back this time waited for no more but rushed frantically off to the sea to the town neither knew nor cared aimlessly wandered hither and thither and it was not until nearly eight that spirited and weary slunk back to the hotel but little more remains to be told cousin accompanied us to goodwood each day arrayed in faultless grey suit irreproach able boots and gloves and last but not least bran new white hat with black band sported also one had bought in the town that very morning and which being considerably too small for me not only kept me incessantly em ployed in trying to keep it on but raised beauti ful scarlet rim all round my forehead and endowed me with headache into the bargain after examining it scornfully said that it was the vulgarist looking hat she had ever seen and she must really decline walking with me she therefore hung on to cousin like leech during the whole racing white hat leaning could not but observe with very un necessary heaviness on his arm and ignored me altogether it is all off between us now and dear hang him reigns in my stead have hated the sight of white hat ever since the vicissitudes of hack related by himself it fjiiuïu related by himself as should like to am describe myself in terms than hack common hack must not run away though with the idea that was never capable of better things than trotting along hard road oh dear no in my salad days bless you could gallop and jump with the best of better indeed than most you may take my word for it that if the galloway racing that is so fashionable just now had been in vogue when was young one could have shown some of them clean pair of heels both over country and on the flat not quite well bred enough though very nearly so for racing too small for hunter hands my height is made my entrée into society as boy hunter the first time was ever put up to auction this was how was described in the catalogue lot swell years old bay gelding an extraordinary fencer very fast possessing exceedingly afraid hack manly manners and sound in every respect would make an admirable boy hunter and the local was quite right should have made an admirable boy hunter very nice indeed should really but for the unfortunate fact that there never was boy born of woman yet that could hold me the moment the hounds found up went my heels and if that was good enough took the bit between my teeth and bolted they nearly always came off at the first fence and then ha ha finished the run in comfort by myself what the good of being called the swell thought to myself if one ca have one own way in this world oh most gentlemanly ideas had can assure you there must have been somethe vicissitudes ok hack fashionable blood knocking about in my small body feel certain suppose during the period that posed as boy hunter visited more hunting countries than any horse of my size in you see it was this way would be sold we say to go into to carry some young gent to hounds well what happened why the very first day we went out together off came the young gent at least it was not my fault if he did sometimes was given another trial sometimes not generally not husbands you can kick off half dozen times day have noticed their womenkind do mind bit how stupid of you is what they generally say when dear or dear as the case may be comes home covered with bruises expecting little sym pathy what good thing because so rare is sympathy if fair creature should happen by chance to be made widow what of it change is always agreeable and the dress is extremely becoming golden hair and widow weeds what can look more charming so though it is quite in the natural order of things that the aforesaid or may tumble about all day if he pleases it does not at all follow that the cherished son and heir should be allowed to do the same so it came to pass that when had carefully disposed of some fond mother darling by either kicking him off or the vicissitudes of hack ning him up against tree or something pleasant of that sort it seldom happened that the treasure was allowed to get upon my back again was dubbed nasty vicious brute and packed off to the nearest dealer at once and the dealer not being born yesterday as the saying is andtllli vicissitudes oí hack knowing perfectly well that there was no earthly chance of selling me in his own my perform anees being too well known would send me straight away to brother dealer in distant count there probably to repeat the performance in this way made acquaintance with the hunting countries in and by the time was eight years old as you may well imagine there was not fence that you could name from wall to bank in that was not thoroughly at home with well this fun could go on for ever had managed to kick boy off in pretty nearly every county in and got such bad name at last amongst the fond mothers that the dealers hated the very sight of me in vain they changed my name to and others of like nature calculated to inspire confidence in maternal bosoms enterprising dealer even christened me the and sent me down to neighbourhood teeming with roman catholics but it was no go there was no mistaking the swell and his wicked ways they all said and they would have me at any price the dealer whose property was now thought the best thing he could do would be to break me into harness he just the sort of little for some young swell to drive about town in buggy overheard him say to his head man one day think not old boy thought to myself the vicissitudes of hack hated the very idea of harness and was deter mined to have none of it there was no saying you know what it might lead to eventually butcher cart or something low of that description in all human probability oh dear no it would never do so having de luded the dealer and his man into the belief that rather liked being driven in harness than not that worthy popped me one day into his own private pony chaise or shay as it was usually and taking his missus as he called his wife along with him away we drove to the neighbouring town to do little shopping ha ha what benefit gave them that after noon turned sharp round at everything met in the road occasionally varying the entertainment with shy was in her mouth the whole of the way she declared and she even wanted to get out and walk but this her husband would not permit declaring as he administered heavy punishment with the whip at each offence that should go better coming back he go bail well we arrived safely in the town and my master having pulled up at the saddler to order something or other was just considering what was the next thing to be done when the noise of brass band in the distance suddenly struck upon my ears crowd was seen approaching it was the troupe of travelling circus doing procession round the town hurrah the very thing ithe vicissitudes of hack stood as quiet as sheep until the first car came close up and then pricking up my ears and giving toss of my head thereby snatching the reins almost out of the dealer hands gave plunge turned sharp round and bolted right across the street bang into confectioner shop bless me what commotion there was was sent flying through the window all amongst the jam tarts and jellies swore at everything nad everybody the mob whooped and yelled the band played whilst having kicked myself clear of what was left of the which was much by the way made dash for it and galloped straight home as hard as could after this escapade my owner was less anxious to keep me than ever as you may fancy and before very many days were over once more found myself back again at tattersall bless you had been there so often that felt quite at home in the place this time was described altogether differently in the catalogue no longer was the admirable boy hunter of former days but hack with capital action and elegant manners suitable for

apparently cut out of the very same pattern as himself also came up and punched me about and felt my legs with con fidence unimaginable himself could have looked wiser over the operation certainly no

for second and then burst into loud laugh horse laugh of course ha ha ha roared he that devilish good my soul it is do you know that no tion never struck me before member of the ha ha ha very good indeed my new friend having had his laugh out became very communicative with the object of putting me in the way of our undergraduate proprietor he told me was quite the fastest man at just then and the hardest rider of the whole the vicissitudes of hack the beggar never so happy as when he jumping big fence said my new friend can you jump he inquired because if you can he be larking you over all the gates in the neighbour hood before you much older he do seem able to resist gate and it does jar legs so coming into road over one said my new ac quaintance with sigh it to be hoped your legs are

thought to myself as the pretty pair took their departure show you what sort of stuff made of before you many hours older see if do at three round they came again up to an alarming extent in riding attire of the most orthodox pattern and decidedly noisy the effect probably of their potations at luncheon my neighbour the friendly brown and myself were then brought out and the gentlemen at once proceeded to mount my new owner aping the jockey held up foot which the attendant hostler evidently used to his ways at once seized and hoisted him into the saddle as lightly as cork knew at once that had got workman on my back and at the same moment the horrible thought struck me that my running away days were over and when thought of the many pleasant gallops had had in the course of my life with no one on my back it really made me feel quite sad well away we trotted through the town our riders admiring their legs in the shop windows as they passed and quickly got into the country now then said my rider throwing away his weed and settling himself down in his saddle we turn in here and then go straight ahead to miles farm pull up there for glass of old beer and then on we go again added he young will join the vicissitudes of hack family party on that young of his and then we have jolly good lark and so saying bringing me up to gate put the whip in confident manner under the latch in

replied the man of few words all serene said my own sporting under graduate with great alacrity oh if he did but know what man he was after my own heart give us friendly lead there good old chap pie old brown sugar generally hits bit and perhaps he break the top bar and make it bit easier for our friend here me if you please did not trouble to reply but simply put the brown horse at the gate new white one the old horse went at it very lazily and though as his master predicted he hit the top bar very hard the gate was none the worse his rider disgusted at such slovenly perform ance got at directly he landed and proceeded to send him along cracker across the plough beyond looking back over his shoulder to see how we got on bless you before he could say if the gate ai the vicissitudes of hack was over the gate and past him like flash of lightning talk about giving me lead indeed ran clean away with my rider for fields jumping each fence as if it was house so he told his friend afterwards then the weight began to tell the more especially as of the fields were plough and uphill and began to slacken my pace bit then it was that for the first time in my life found out what the word retribution meant for the moment felt me cease pulling at him he exclaimed oh no you do you little devil you not going to bolt one minute and stop the next not quite come gurr along with you directly so saying he shook the reins and touched me with his spurs and sent me at an awkward stile hundred miles an hour had had quite enough of it can tell you and was never better pleased in my life than when at the end of the next field caught sight of the farmhouse at which my owner and his friend had announced their intention of halting made mental vow never to run away again was in short obliged to recognise the fact that riding undergraduate was very different customer to have on one back from schoolboy home for the holidays whom had no difficulty in parting company with at any moment chose well had great fun during my universitythe vicissitudes of hack career and my only regret was that it did not last longer than it did had not been up quite year however before elated at having won lot of money on the shire celebrated the event to such tune that the college authorities took it upon themselves to decline his further acquaintance his tutor who was very fond of him tried hard to save his scapegrace pupil but the some how could not be brought to see any fun in being obliged to vacate together with his belongings his house for fully week in consequence of its having been rendered uninhabitable by red hot shovel well sprinkled with cayenne pepper being introduced into it through window so there was nothing for it but for my young friend to go and go he did to the great regret of his tutor his gyp his bedmaker and numerous tradesmen he having as they feelingly expressed it spent his money like gentleman during his sojourn in their midst the worst of it was that and the other nags had to go too for though we had not assisted in any of our spirited young proprietor escapades such as cayenne peppering the house nailing the up in his and so on it was decided by guardian that it would be best for his ward to travel for while with view to toning down his too exuberant spirits and as he could hardly take us along with him round the vicissitudes of hack the world the whole lot of us once more put in an appearance in tattersall catalogue this time as the property of gentleman going abroad felt very sad can tell you when for the last time my dear old friend and went over with each other the many pleasant days we had had together the canters over breezy the larks across country had my full share of the latter you may depend for knowing what jumper he possessed in me oh could jump can tell you my sporting owner was perpetually making fancy bets and winning them too that he would jump this place or that on my back my legs are what they were and not so young as was tremble to think what shall come to at last said poor brown sugar mine are much better and feel very old sometimes groaned in concert there were no two horses in more unhappy than brown sugar and myself that night do assure you our feelings were not improved you may depend when accompanied by his friend came to bid us farewell with all his extravagance and wild ness he was good hearted natural young fellow and there was something very like tear in his eye and will swear his voice was bit husky as he caressed me and bade me good bye whilst in my turn rubbed my soft muzzle up against histhe vicissitudes of hack chest and nibbled at the piece of sugar he had brought for me how envied his constant companion the wire haired terrier the chances are he would not accompany his master abroad but then what good time he would have at the guardian place in the country looked after and petted probably by the ladies of the house and waging war from morning to night with his natural enemies the rats and the rabbits whether it was that my legs were worse than myself was actually aware of or whether it was that showed unmistakable signs of wear and tear goodness only knows but must say was hardly prepared for the remark made by rough coper like sort of fellow when on my making my appearance at the rostrum politely inquired if anyone would put me in at yermean said the brute with loud laugh at his own wit despite his persuasive eloquence the highest bid that the great auctioneer could get for me was twenty pounds my purchaser being dandified looking personage rejoicing in the name of the royal belvedere riding school the vicissitudes of hack so ran his card am inclined to think that or as the wags of the place persisted in calling him was one of the most pretentious humbugs that ever was born certainly the greatest man in that line ever came across and such snob my word such snob he lived at the well known watering place of where he kept what he called the royal belvidere riding school fancy man professing to teach the art of horsemanship who could barely sit upon horse without tumbling off however will generally carry man through in pretty nearly every calling and assuredly had an unlimited stock of that commodity believe he had been originally haberdasher assistant at all events people said so and some wag in consequence christened him cash forward that and pretty names he was always called when spoken of in conversation and very appropriate names they were especially the former it was an impressive sight to see the swell riding master got up like ring master in circus titupping along with his pupils the said pupils consisting of ladies young and of certain age and few little boys and girls my de ar miss he would say with his most captivating grin showing fine row of false my de ar miss dessay you wish me at but you are not the vicissitudes of hack your reins quite as should wish or my dear positive you think me dreadful bore wish me at genevar in fact but must trouble you to carry your left little differently so and the whip in the right so thanks thanks this remark daresay you wish me at genevar was the conceited puppy favourite expression it was never out of his mouth indeed where he picked it up goodness knows perhaps he invented it himself as for myself took an inveterate dislike to the fellow and longed for the day when he would venture to get upon my back it was destined to arrive before very long and it was an odd circumstance but true nevertheless that in an indirect manner his first mount on me proved the making of fortune midsummer arrived and all was away disporting itself at different resorts of pleasure some at the seaside others on the continent and so on no one ever dreamed of stopping in during the dogdays if they could possibly manage to get away our friend cash forward who always liked to be in the fashion would have gone away too probably to but for the fact that the best paying pupil he possessed certain rich widow named persisted in staying at hot as it was all through the summer season and going out riding every day with dearthe vicissitudes of hack as she called him for was fully as vulgar as the ex haberdasher and knocked the letter about quite as much as he did they were indeed well matched pair well every afternoon as regularly as clockwork just in the very hottest part of the day the great would wend his way to the widow home himself on fiery untamed steed and his man leading another for the riding master was far too great swell to do anything of the sort himself the great man would return from of these rides in fine state of perspiration vowing that the old woman as he irreverently styled would shortly be the death of him and wishing her most heartily at genevar it was one hotter day than usual in the month of august men walked about with white um brellas over their heads dogs went along with their tongues out and the very pavement looked so hot that it seemed as if it must blister people feet as they walked along that there hold lady never go hout for ride sich wery day as this here surelie will she master remarked old head man as the latter approached the saddle room where he was busy furbishing up pair of stirrup irons yes she will replied the riding master gloomily no day too for her seem ingly wish she was at genevar with all my do he added thé vicissitüdes of hack you ca ride the brown this afternoon went on the dickens ca exclaimed his master what up with him pray dead lame was the reply bruised his fut yes terday when you was out trod on stone that bad job returned his master in that case best ride the swell do you think he quiet enough ai he aye he quiet enough was the response nice little is the swell the best we gotten reckon all right said his master as he turned to go into the house saddle the swell for me at three and slyboots forthe old girl same as usual well thought to myself as cash forward got up as usual like ring master mounted me in his yard never had such tailor as you on my back before that is certain and if do get rid of you in the course of the afternoon my name not the swell and you should have seen and slyboots dressed as the fat old widow was in brown holland habit which fitted her without wrinkle she looked like large apple dumpling going out for ride as for her face crimson as it was with the heat it might easily have been mistaken for the rising sun do wonder that poor wished her at the vicissitudes op hack well the widow being mounted away we went through the town got into the country and presently arrived on slopperton down and now my dear exclaimed the widow ow would it be if we nice canter it ai so ot now we got on the and feel as if it would do me good certainly madam replied the wretched cash forward running down with perspiration ex cuse me daresay you wish me at genevar but first of all if you allow me adjust your skirt that it now then your down little more your left eld so and off we go and off we did go too to some tune for the moment he touched me with the spur with plunge and kick sent the ex haberdasher flying clean over my head nor was that all slyboots inspired by my example proceeded to kick up his heels as well with the result that before you could say knife was lying on her back on the grass kicking about like lively turtle away slyboots and went careering over the downs like pair of wild things when we had had enough of it we had good browse in little hazel copse we came to and were just thinking of making tracks for home when shepherd sent in search of us caught us unawares and brought us back to our rightful owner and his pupil and the shepherd having held us whilst they each mounted off we went the vicissitudes of hack there was no doubt what had happened during slyboots and my absence for the riding master had his arm round the waist of his fair charge nearly all the way back to and such hugging and kissing and calling each other endearing epithets you never heard the next day it was publicly announced that was engaged to be married to and great was the excitement in the town can tell you shortly after an advertisement appeared in the local papers setting forth that the royal belvidere riding school with its valuable stud of horses and ponies was to be disposed of by private contract am at this moment wondering what will become of me old cash forward and the fair are to be married next week they go to genevar to spend the honeymoon how miss brown went to the lífcs roto ir mcnt to tbc pcrbir ho is there who has not heard of non pareil sauce nay will go further than that and ask who is there who has not tasted nonpareil sauce but there why should ask such an absurd question of course everybody has tasted nonpareil sauce that is every body who is anybody and knows what what personally am one of those dread ful people who always have an appetite and con sequently when the mutton chop of the period is set before me want no extra inducement in the way of sauce or pickle to make it go down on the contrary much prefer it without holding that the good meat is rather spoiled than how miss brown went to the derby wise by the so called relish but am not everyone and there is no doubt that not only are all sauces much appreciated but that of all the sauces extant brown nonpareil is at the head of the poll at home and abroad you ca go any where without meeting with it look upon it indeed as quite an old friend if find myself as occasionally do in strange place where do know soul am sure to run across ofhow miss brown went to the derby familiar pictorial advertisements before have been there ten minutes feel then that am no longer alone is it to be wondered at therefore that when the originator of the famous sauce paid the debt of nature he should leave very hand some sum of money behind him he most certainly did and more than that he left an extremely pretty daughter as well after the old man death went to live with her guardian and uncle sir rich city knight who had married her father sister had departed this life some years previously so found herself sole châtelaine of the big house in portman square and in short space of time being very self willed and determined young woman the servants and every body about the place including sir himself found that her word was law upon everything sir good man feeling that his ward should have somebody to direct her foot steps in the way they should go provided her with lady companion sheep dog irreverently termed the poor lady and as gave her clearly to understand before she had been in the house half an hour that she intended to do always exactly as she liked the got on admirably together the best of eating and drinking nothing to do and plenty of time to do it in and last but how miss brown went to the derby handsome salary it is not surprising that poor faded who had been more or less of drudge in the governess line all her life made mental vow to herself that she would never leave her dear charge until she married and not then if she could help it certainly was as wilful young woman as you would find in day march never come across such perwerse gal never would remark her groom when insteadhow miss brown went to the derby of riding in the row like an ordinary young lady of fashion she would take sudden fancy in her head that it was pleasanter far to ride about in country lanes instead of the hot and dusty park accordingly off she would go to or the swell groom sulking behind her and vowing to himself he would give warning directly he got home so low too in her he informed the sympathising company in the hall blowed if she do stop and talk to every old woman and child as she meets it that wot call it the swell groom was not the only one by any means who found the fair perverse old lady cribbage who chaperoned her on all occasions vowed she was the most extraordinary girl quite unlike anybody she had ever met indeed she only hoped and trusted she told sir that dear would never finish up by making some dreadful mesalliance in the matrimonial line the fact was that her ladyship who was match maker of the most pronounced type had tried all she knew to secure and her three hundred thousand pounds for her beloved but impecunious nephew sir but without success the baronet as it happened had not long before had shy as he called it but with no luck how miss brown went to the derby another heiress whose name by strange coinci dence happened to be harvey of this fact though he did not know it was well aware consequently when the ardent lover threw himself at her feet fine afternoon and offered her his hand and heart all that he had to offer indeed she met him coolly with no thank you sir if sauce wo suit you sure wo dash it but that the sauciest gal ever met in all my life exclaimed the discomfitedhow miss brown went to the derby baronet as he rushed from the house in great anger he told the story the same night in strict con fidence of course to his dear friend and it was as matter of course all over the town the next day indeed it eventually reached the august ears of the great himself who loving good joke took an early opportunity of being introduced to the fair heiress in fact became all the rage and the num ber of offers she received in her first season was something incredible there was not indeed an impecunious swell in who did not think it his bounden duty to enter for the nonpareil as they called her and her money bags she got quite tired of refusing them at last with all her little eccentricities was as good hearted girl as ever lived and she could bear the notion that men should come and propose to her for her mone sake alone as she very well knew was the case oh that was poor woman she often would sajq with sigh to the sympathising perhaps then someone would really care for me for never mind my dear would reply that hearted soul kissing her nevermind will come along your waj one of these days you may depend at this would heave deep sigh for how miss brown went to the derby was suitor amongst the many she had rejected whom she was not quite certain that she had not made mistake in sending about his business with the rest oh she would murmur if could only bring myself to believe that you loved me for myself what happy woman should be but there it is all over between us now the thing is done and so it is no good thinking about it any more in proof of which the pretty violet eyes would fill with tears and she would go to her photograph album and gaze for good many minutes at portrait therein of remarkably handsome young man attired in cavalry uniform well as we have already mentioned miss was as thorough going creature of impulse as you would find in day march anywhere therefore it will not surprise the reader to hear that strolling out with her little terrier snap to do some shopping in regent street or thereabouts on the morning of the derby the arrival of which festive occasion she had for gotten but was now reminded of by the sight of the drags and other vehicles she saw starting for the scene of action she seemed in what the servants would term one of her sudding fits of perverseness to be seized with violent desire to go too what lark it would be would it snap how miss brown went to the derby was just wee bit slangy when excited would you like to go to the my dear little doggie said she addressing her diminutive pet snap promptly barked his willingness to join in any fun that was going on and further testified his entire approval of the scheme by dancing round and round his mistress in an excited manner snap settled the question effectually cabman said hailing passing hansom want to go to the is your horse capable of going as far do you think will my little takeyer down to the my lady replied cabby with suspicion of scorn in his tone why bless yer it be little for he hown brother to he is you just jump in miss and he rattle yer down to hepsom in less time than any hanimal on the road pun ten there and back and wot yer likes to give me for myself and better bargain you say you never made there was no resisting this and accordingly taking snap up in her arms jumped in and having previously called at pastrycook and bought some buns for refreshment in case of hun ger away she bowled in the hansom en route for the brother to as if anxious to keep up the high character his owner had given him laying himself out in what that worthy was pleased to term slap up how miss brown went to the derby first rater ai he miss said he address ing his fare as he descended from his perch at public house on the road in order to rinse his horse mouth out and at the same time lay some of the dust that had got down his own throat in the course of the dusty drive from town the paddick or the grand stand miss inquired later on popping his head through his trap door as they neared the top of the hill well hardly know replied in some doubt perhaps though you had better stop at the paddock as have no one to go to in the stand what do you think cabman well said that worthy with the air of father of family after moment consideration under the succumstances the paddick would be the most respeckable of the miss you see all the fust rate and the start as well if you walks down to the little gate at the fur corner and shall be just outside whenever you wants to come away very well then replied stop outside the paddock perhaps it will be the best place for me as you say under the added she laughing accordingly she and snap alighted outside the paddock and requesting the cabman to be in readi ness directly after the was over she obtained her ticket and walked in it was lovely day and enjoyed the scenehow miss brown went to the derby immensely she had some difficulty in avoiding the many people she knew and that was the only drawback however with the aid of her sunshade she succeeded tolerably well and by and by several of the favourites arriving she found her presence more or less ignored so was enabled to her great delight to look about her without so much fear of how miss brown went to the derby presently the jockeys having mounted and gone out on to the course there was general exodus of sportsmen and in few minutes independent had the paddock nearly to her self in few minutes back they all galloped making for the gate at the far end that the friendly cabman had recommended her to go to and thither she now turned her footsteps and from it viewed the start with much satisfaction to herself they off roared the multitude as at the second attempt the horses got away to splendid start and turning round ran off as fast as she could scuttle and with her heart beating to the in the direction of the entrance gate which she reached just in time to catch glimpse of the finish in another second the was thing of the past and the winner followed by the others galloped into the paddock in her excitement longed to pat him as he passed her and snap still his mistress arm barked his congratulations as he walked by her en route to weigh in and now exclaimed she it strikes me snap that the sooner we are off the better so calling her cabman who true to his word was close at hand she once more entered the hansom and started for the homeward journey to town munching her buns and washing them down with bottle of lemonade now somewhat warm that the cabman had obtained for her atmiss brown in the how miss brown went to the derbÿ the house where they stopped on the way down felt thoroughly happy indeed she informed snap as she kissed his nose that she had never enjoyed day outing so much in her life therefore it was extremely mean of own brother to when they had gone eight miles on the road to suddenly tumble down as dead as needless to sa it did not take many seconds for crowd of the unwashed to put in their unwelcome appearance who not content with confining their attentions to the defunct cab horse must needs proceed to mob the fair occupant of the cab who had jumped out immediately the catastrophe happened the cabman behaved like trump but could do nothing against such overwhelming numbers and poor now thoroughly frightened defend ing snap with all her might from the attentions of burly ruffian who was endeavouring with many oaths to snatch him from her arms was just about to scream for help as last resource when suddenly something whistled by her ear and in second down went the would be dog stealer on his back in the road having been floored by right hander that would have done credit to delivered by good looking young fellow who now taking arm within his made his way through the disappointed mob to the hansom he had evidently just quitted in lesshow miss brown went to the derby time than it takes to write this he had lifted in and following himself bade the driver get on quickly and that worthy whipping up his horse away they went amidst storm of jeers and execrations and now said the whom we have already alluded to as being one of rejected perhaps you will tell me miss how it is find you in this lively position what on earth induced you to come out to epsom all by yourself and explained as well as she could winding up with little penitence on her own account very wonderful thing for her to do the reader may be sure will never do such stupid thing again said she with hysterical little sob after which she was unusually quiet and leaning well back in the corner of the hansom scarcely spoke word until they reached portman square you will come in for few minutes will you not captain said as her deliverer assisted her to alight have something added she looking pleadingly up into his face on seeing him hesitate very particular to say toyou something must say before we part oh certainly if may was the cold rejoinder was evidently on his stilts and the entered the house and ascended to the drawing how miss brown went to the derby want to ask you favour captain began looking straight into face and talking very quickly whilst her fingers played nervously with her gloves do you happen to know anyone amongst your friends who is in want of governess or companion good fair linguist paints little on china tolerably amiable and ahem not baddooking well no ca say do replied twiddling his moustache and looking solemn rather out of my line do you know eh miss do my best though of course who the lady may ask me what exclaimed starting up from the sofa as if he was shot you why good gracious me mean what on earth do you mean after being so mad as to go to the by yourself are you going to be still more lunaticky and set up as governess with all your vast wealth too oh you ca be serious am perfectly serious captain can assure you replied with somewhat of of tremble in her voice you talk of my vast wealth would you be surprised to hear that owing to bad investments etc etc have lost the whole of my fortune and am at this moment penniless girl entirely dependent on my own exertions and without home unless my unclehow miss brown went to the derby chooses to give me one oh you dreadful little storyteller are you sorry say you sorry for believe you liked me little once pleaded holding out her hands sorry exclaimed seizing the hands his handsome face radiant with happiness sorry why never was so pleased in my life oh it almost too good to be true you refused me in your wealth you wo refuse me in your poverty say you wo and what was reply ca you all the time the lovers were disturbed some ten minutes later by the sudden entrance into the room of sir why my goodness me where on earth have you been all day exclaimed the fussy old alderman here was came away early from on purpose to take you to see the pictures he called them picters at the french gallery and on my arrival home you are not to be found anywhere and poor in terrible way about you where have you been child where have you been where have been why to the to be sure uncle replied who had now quite recovered her usual spirits everybody goes to the so why not poor me enjoyed myself extremely thank you and got back as you how miss brown went to the derby quite safely thanks here she looked shyly at to captain here by the way uncle she went on laughingly seeing that the old man looked from one to the other in some confusion let me introduce him to you and then you can ask him to dinner if you like and every night after until further notice he come you my future husband said taking the now blushing by the hand and leading him sir sir my future hunting story for children chapter ilittlc afairg afirst meet hy where little what has become of little such were the cries that were heard on all sides from both high and low when at the meet of hounds at rnan pleath on certain decem ber morning the master was seen riding up with out his child com panion at his side he looked graver than usual too it was noticed as he exchanged his hack for his hunter and greeted his friends and the reason quickly went round was ill little fairy and then gloom seemed to fall over the whole hunt and really you would have thought that little was the daughter or sister of each individual sportsman there assembled and now who was this little that every body was in such distress about well she was the seven year old daughter and only child of the master of the hounds when some three years before the as he was always called had the misfortune to lose his wife on whom he doted he at once concentrated all his affection on his little shy reserved man at all times even to his intimates he unbent in the presence of his baby daughter as he never condescended to elsewhere small was indeed comfort to him in his affliction the family doctor shrewd old expressed his opinion indeed very freely that had it not been for the bright little lassie as he called and the hounds he would not have given much for the reason or his life either and he would add the latter sir would have bin particle use without the former but the combined formed you understand most useful nation more useful indeed than all the prescriptions put together and we have not the slightest doubt in ourlittle fairy own mind that the worthy medico was perfectly right well time went on and and his little daughter grew more inseparable than ever and at last came the day red letter day in both their calendars you may depend when miss was to make her first appearance in the hunting field then it was that old of the wild farm when he beheld cantering up to the meet on her pony arrayed in scarlet riding habit and velvet hunting cap with her golden tresses flying in the breeze declared that if ever he saw fairy out of picter book the pretty dear was that article and as was reckoned an oracle in those parts was known hereafter as even her father adopted the name and what dear little it was how do was her greeting always to the huntsman how do dear hounds to the pack she would then kiss her hand to the company generally in response to their salutes like the miniature queen she was and now she was poor little of all the members of hunt present that day none felt the absence of so much as dashing young sabreur in her majesty regiment of hussars it was curious the attachment there going to the meet little fairy between the notwithstanding their disparity in years for when at home on leave no knight was ever more constant in his attentions to his ladye love than was dear as always called him to his child sweetheart like her other slave her father never seemed to look upon her in any other light than that of grown up young woman and treated her as such in the gravest possible manner much to the amusement of the lookers on yes was very sad that day you may depend it certainly seemed too as if enforced absence from the meet brought bad luck to the pack for though they drew and drew covert after covert the hounds never found all the morn ing and at two as rule loath to go home announced his intention of doing so and you come with me wo you said he looking wistfully at the young soldier know and there was falter in his voice as he spoke she will like to see you of course will was the reply and the pair accordingly rode off the old doctor belore mentioned met them at the door as they rode up to the house an hour afterwards glad to see ye both and you especially said he glancing significantly at little fairy puir little lassie verra verra ill fear the worst he whispered to the hussar touching his arm as he spoke but it joost possible your prisince may work wonders with the little woman and then they went upstairs of course the servants were all in tears for they had quite made up their minds that miss must die silly idjuts observed doctor contemptuously as accompanied by wright he motioned them to be silent and entered the sick room five minutes afterwards the distracted father looking twenty years older than he had in the morning opened the door noiselessly and beck oned to his friend she asking for you he whispered how do dear said poor little as sank on his knees by the bed tiss me you to tiss me in your yed toat you know do you so pretty in your yed toat and clasped the tiny frame in his arms and the child glorious golden hair fell all over his face as he kissed her passionately over and over again the doctor at last touched him on the shoulder and he gently disengaged himself must go now dear whispered he little fairy trying hard to restrain the tears that would somehow come no do do remonstrated the child feel so tired and peeping on your yed toat once more she nestled her head against his breast and appeared to be going to sleep then suddenly she brightened up and held her small finger up in her old imperious way dear she whispered what my darling be oor little some day dear yes dear little child dood night if this had been stage play at this period the organ which of course would have been con veniently situated in the next room would have struck up solemn air calculated to give the creeps would have been heard in the distance more angels would be seen hover ing round the ceiling the limelight would have been turned full on the face of the or rather dead child for of course on the stage they are never by any chance allowed to and nothing would be heard but the sobs and sniffs from the dress and upper circles the pit and the gallery the stalls and private boxes little fairy give way to their feelings it either not the correct thing or else they have got any but this is only commonplace story there fore possibly the reader will not be surprised to hear that thanks to the skill of doctor little notwithstanding that the domestics headed by her old nurse one and all agreed amongst themselves that poor miss was going poor lamb and believe fond as they were of her were rather disappointed that she eventually battled successfully with the fever so successfully indeed that she was able to write her dear pretty letter wish ing him good bye and au revoir just before he sailed to join his regiment in little fairy chapter ii in meet of hounds at man the scene is not changed in the least still the same looking old beerhouse kept by still the same cluster of tumble down cottages not forget ting the usual accompaniment of slouching fied looking men slatternly women and ragged children who always turn out en masse on these occasions the old white horse is there too dirtier than ever nobody ever yet saw common without dirty old white horse browsing upon it and the usual donkey and the usual ducks and fowls if the scene is not changed though the actors are who for instance is this who rides up all smiles to the meet can this be our old friend little fairy yes it is none other but how altered he is greyer and stouter than of yore but his face has lost the pained expression it had ten years ago and he looks twice as young in conse quence and who is the lovely girl with the fair hair attired in the brown habit who rides by his side sitting her bay hunter with the ease that none but perfect horsewoman could assume can this be the little girl whom old of the wild farm years ago chris tened grown into charming woman she does not say how do dear hounds to the pack as in the old days and she does not kiss her hand as the old original little was wo nt to in response to the salutations she received as she rode up but it is miss as she is now called for all that and pray who is the military looking man faultlessly attired in pink who accompanies the and his fair daughter and whose bronzed face tells of service under eastern suns surely this is not little devoted slave and admirer the old original indeed it is though major now if you please and apparently just as much slave us ever judging at least by the way miss wright orders him about little fairy at him the sly fellow as he gets off his hack and proceeds to tighten his ladye love girths ere he gets upon his hunter he reminds her that the last time he came to meet at dollman they had blank day you were away ill do you remem ber was fancy now your recollect ing all that ten years ago too why should have thought you had forgotten it long ago forgotten it indeed you little hypocrite had either of you forgotten it well if hounds had blank day on that occasion it is very certain they did not on this for they had the run of the season the very fastest thing they had so far since the first of november fifty five minutes as hard as ever they could go with only one check and winding up with kill in the open they finished long way from home and the december evening was closing in and the rooks and the woodpigeons were thinking of going to bed as and miss on their tired steeds rode slowly along towards home they were all by themselves for somehow or another they had managed to part company in the most natural way possible with and the hounds what are you thinking of inquired after long silence is it any use con the run of the season little fairy tinued she laughingly my offering you penny for your thoughts sir no tell you without that said was thinking do you know of that time just ten years ago when you were so ill and wer expected to live dear do you remember his voice got very low just now and trembled somewhat yes said she simply looking up into his face oh yes remember it so well and how you came to see me in your red coat and were so kind and the tears were in eyes now finished the story for her and somehow or other as he did so his arm crept round her waist and her head fell upon his scarlet shoulder as naturally as possible oh yes quite naturally and this is what he said yes dear you are quite right came to see you in my red coat and you nestled your head upon my breast just as you are doing now and you said to me in your childish way shall be your little wife some day sha dear my own darling will you be my little wife some day and do you know never so much as answered him which was very unkind of little fairy but then you know there is an old saying and very often true viz that silence gives consent and we may presume that that is exactly what happened in this case for when hounds met two days afterwards everybody was apparently speaking at once and on topic and this is what everybody said heard the news about major and miss no why they engaged to be married to be sure house in the country pause iit part cook dweller in all the year round it has for years been my secret ambition to take house in the country for the summer at which period of the year it is my custom to take my annual well earned holiday until the present year however this darling wish of my heart has never to use turfy expression come off for the very good reason that my wife who in my case is decidedly the better has always insisted on going to the sea the very mention of the country to her is apparently gall and wormwood no always replies decisively when as the dog days draw nigh we proceed to discuss house in the country our holiday plans and mildly make my annual but fruitless suggestion of the no reallycannot entertain the idea for moment really can not to be cooped up in some out of the way country place miles and miles away from any town or station in all probability not doctor near if any of us were taken ill papers two days old no books to read and not soul to speak to except the clergyman of the parish and his belong ings for of course only going as we should to place of that sort for such short time no one round about would think it worth while to call on us oh it would be too terrible an ordeal at this point she would set her teeth and shud der knew that shudder well and always took it as signal for me to shut up married men please sympathise house in the country feel perfectly certain she would continue my health would give way were even to attempt it the dear children too they would not like it half so well no nice sands for them to play about on no sea bathing nothing but lot of nasty furze bushes and woods and places for them to scratch their eyes out and tear their clothes all to bits and then having said all she could say in opposition to my scheme she would add insult to injury by exclaiming but do let me stop you dear can take the children and nurse and my wife maid to ramsgate as usual sure those lodgings we were in last year were so comfortable really was just like being at our own home and dear old with that charming white hair of hers just like an old picture was so delightful how artful women are why if had dared to have proposed jaunt on my own account there would have been such shindy as never was however my wish was to be fulfilled at last and it came about in the following manner on certain hot morning towards the end of june turned out of my office about noon to walk to my solicitor office hard by to see him on some business or other now be it known the said solicitor house in the country by name besides being all that of his profes sion should be in the matter of shrewdness and long headedness is away from his law papers and parchments as cheery soul as ever you came across and hospitable to degree whenever oppor tunity offers notorious gourmet he not only does himself well but his friends into the bargain and an invitation to dine or lunch or sup as the case may be is not thing to be sneezed at by any manner of means the little luncheons in his private room in the city are proverbial therefore our business over did not want much pressing you may be sure when announcing with smile of satisfaction that it was one jumped up from his chair and throwing open the door of his inner room invited me to enter and partake of what he was pleased to call snack the snack in question being an elaborate meal provided by of the most celebrated of the restaurateurs whose establishment lay contiguous to office when hungry man has partaken liberally of mayonnaise of lobster and galantine aux truffes winding up with half dozen or so of those most insinuating of tarts commonly called maids of honour sent specially from washing the whole down with magnum of perrier jouet it would be but natural that he shojild feel on the best of terms not only with himself but with the world in general house in the country that is precisely how felt after luncheon as leant back in the easiest of chairs puffing contentedly at of my host fragrant cigars there was nothing would have done for anybody at that moment short of backing bill verily believe you do puff know anyone puff suppose who wants place in the country for couple of months or so this summer do you inquired in the confidential lazy sort of manner man assumes when engaged in the consumption of tobacco because if you do puff he went on heard of one this morning the very thing for you or anyone wishing to spend holiday in the heart of the country my client captain clatterton late of the hussars writes me word that wishing to go abroad for three months he wants to let his house in for that period the shortest way though will be to read you his letter and you can then judge for yourself so saying producing it from his pocket adjusted his and proceeded to read as follows the old manor house june dear sooby the wife and are thinking of going abroad for two or three months and want to find tenant for my house during my house in the country here are particulars old house lots of old oak and that sort of thing about it ceous garden with the biggest cedar in in the middle of it and trout stream which the tenant is welcome to fish in running through the bottom of it close to church and post office use of pony and trap kitchen garden produce eggs etc thrown in do want any rent all ask being for the tenant to pay the servants and take care of the place as if was here myself if you should come across anyone amongst your friends wanting anything of the sort put him on to me there good chap and you will confer an obligation on yours truly forgot to mention that the nearest town is ten miles sounds nice do it said folding up the captain letter and returning it to its enve lope the only drawback that can see he continued is the distance from the nearest town some people would make that an objection should myself for instance others on the con trary think the farther they are away from the madding crowd the better what anyhow there it is you might mention it amongst youra house in the country friends and if you should come across anyone inclined to take it why send him on to me the effect of that letter on me taken as it was on the top of very excellent luncheon magical in the extreme could see the old manor house with its trout stream its big cedar its kitchen gardens full of strawberries and its fresh eggs to say nothing of the little church round the corner and the convenient post office in my mind eye as plain as pikestaff my mind was made up on the spot exclaimed starting up an seizing my astonished host by the hand you need not house in the country further than this room to look for tenant for the old manor house take it myself my boy and you can write and tell captain what his name so as soon as you like bravo so you shall replied my jovial solicitor reciprocating the shake of the hand but and his countenance fell what will the wife say my name omitted to say is my boy eh say do care what she says replied recklessly this is chance of enjoying myself that may never meet with again and intend to take advantage of it if my wife do care to come why she must stop away that all intend to go so whatever you do my dear fellow write to the captain this very night wo you promised so to do we had glass apiece of some curious brown sherry he produced to celebrate the event as he said and soon after departed to my own office in the most jubilant state of mind it is possible to conceive the first thing did when reached home that evening was to break the news to my wife she took it with most exasperating coolness and if she was angry which have reason to believe she was she concealed it remarkably well have often told you said she when you have proposed this sort of thing before go into the country by all means if it pleases you take shooting box fishing box any sort of boxa house in the country you like but do ask me to go because nothing would induce me to do no dear here she took skein of worsted in her mouth and in consequence spoke with difficulty of course on purpose to aggravate me go to your old manor house by all means and when there sincerely hope you will enjoy yourself as for myself and the children here she sighed sigh redolent of christian resignation we must be content as usual suppose with miss stuffy lodgings at the last time she spoke of that worthy person it was in terms of the highest praise she paused doubtless expecting to see some signs of wavering in my face but finding none she rose sniffed violently bad sign and hastily cramming her work anyhow into its basket left the room abruptly probably to indulge in what the ladies are fond of describing as good cry which idea of mine received confirmation by her appearing at dinner an hour afterwards rather red about the eyelids her salts bottle too was in constant requisition during the meal alas all these signals of distress on the part of the injured martyr had no more effect on my obdurate bosom than water on duck back ha ha the summit of my ambition was at last reached had taken house in the country house in the country part ii et trbere extract from diary of july aftainj chatterton writes to say that he has cleared out use his own expression and that can therefore enter on possession of the old manor as soon as please hurrah cheers and cheer more for the gallant captain of the old man not bad parody eh be off on monday next on monday morning accordingly having taken leave of my wife and children the former of whom received my farewell caress with frigid indifference took my departure in the best possible spirits and wheeled cab to the station en route for and the old manor house railway people are evidently great observers of character for the guard evidently on the strength of my countrified get up blue birdseye tie plaid suit and clump soled shoesa house in the country and gaiters as he arranged my things for me in comfortable smoking compartment addressed me as expressing hope that the weather would keep fine for the farmers this was gratifying to my feelings and that guard received crown for his civility on the spot he left me and was immediately succeeded by the paper boy who appeared armed not only with all the sporting papers of the day but basketful of sporting novels and magazines as well guard had evidently told him was house in the country sportsman thinking it incumbent upon me to keep up appearances and in order not to make any mistake for did not know paper from the other went in for the lot the whole bag of in fact and sporting novel as well the boy was evidently impressed thankee said he pocketing the penny bit had presented him with would yer like form at glance sir git it for yer direckly if yer would very for the winners replied would have it not in the least knowing what it was he meant before the journey was over however not only discovered the nature of the work in question but found myself sincerely wishing had never seen it for its possession involved me in weary conversation with sporting traveller concerning the forthcoming leger matter on which was profoundly ignorant and took not the slightest interest in and which only ceased when the train arrived at choribury oh what terrible confab that was and how hated my fellow traveller if he could only have guessed what gibberish it sounded to my ignorant ears he never would have wasted his time it was all my fault he saw me investigating the contents of form at glance and it gave him the cue at once house in the country the mare seems to have coming appearance for the he remarked as looking up for second caught his eye yes she does replied at hazard the question he went on whether wo beat her have great doubts do you know in my own mind whether she can stay what do you think oh she can stay all right replied in confident manner in fact know she added was positively frightened at my own impudence for did even know her name ah that exactly what wanted to said my friend with knowing wink at me as much as to say what downy pair we are are we oh how pleased was when the train ran in to and was enabled to see the last of my sporting fellow traveller we said adieu to each other with mutual respect fancy he went away under the impression that was possessed of some private information regarding the favourite for the name unknown oh was getting on as country gentleman distinctly getting on beg pardon sir but you be the man for inquired the porter house in the country had collected my luggage touching his cap respect fully as he spoke yes answered loftily ah thought as you might was the reply as see the captain man outside with the pony cart as if he was for on going outside sure enough there was servant in livery with decidedly military cut about him sitting in little village cart drawn by good looking pony the menial in question excused himself in strong hibernian accent for not getting out of the cart bekase the pony could abide her head to be she chimed in the porter who was listening with grin the fust and honly time as tuk hold on her she ketched hold of my harm and pretty nigh bit it in afore she let go and when she done with me the wixen she runs the cart back and squeezes commercial gent as was standing there up agin the wall and made him holler just as if he was nice pony that thought to myself is she quiet when she does start inquired oh yes she all right when she once off never replied the captain man all you got to do is to make dash like into the trap so as she ai got time to think ofa house in the country keeping you out and after that wo get in front of hev on the road between this and her stable you may accordingly having arranged for my luggage to follow on in the carrier cart and the expectant porter did as was bid and made dash into the cart sort of flying leap which landed me handsomely with my nose on the front rail it was of those conveyances where the driver sits sideways the moment did so the pony who seemed to know precisely what had happened and was probably much annoyed at being done out of her fun gave snatch at her bit laid her ears back to her poll and started off at score occasionally varying the entertainment by breaking into gallop which action on her part had the same effect on the cart that house in the country sea has on small boat and nearly shook the inside out of me does she always on this asked as the cart went wobbling about in the most unpleasant manner most was the laconic reply it strikes me very forcibly thought to myself that as far as am concerned the playful little creature will spend good deal of her time in the stable during my stay in this however kept to myself deeming it politic indeed to praise her in order to get into the good graces of the groom there was no denying the fact that she was all that worthy described her namely rale beauty to look being built quite on the lines of miniature racehorse and she was undoubtedly good one to as the short time she took to do the ten miles conclusively house in the country part iii itcural tfelícítv extracts from diary of july rived this afternoon at the old manor house feeling after the shaking that had undergone in the captain pony cart just as if was landing at folkestone after rough passage from the old remedy pint of per rier and biscuit on the spot much better take look round old manor house charming oak panels lattice windows postern doors and all that sort of thing eternally just the sort of place you see depicted in the christmas numbers of the illustrated papers and ternally possessing that delightful musty sort of smell suggestive of rats damp and indifferent drainage which as every one knows is the charm of an old house am reminded of my landlord military career at every turn in the entrance hall are his ioo house in the country leopard skins saddle cloths and sundry cavalry sabres spurs bits etc all polished as bright as silver the dining room again and indeed nearly every room in the house is adorned with portraits of his favourite chargers and photographs of him self and other members of the regiment in dress undress and mufti in the drawing room are hung up the gallant hussar sabretache and or other trifles for which ca find the name arranged as sort of trophy really feel almost as if had been in the service myself captain would sound at all bad now come to think of it martial law has evidently been the order of the day during the captain regime and am no doubt expected to keep it up the trim little parlourmaid sounds little gong in the hall at stated intervals during the day such as breakfast time lunch time etc she evidently enjoys it which is more than do hate gongs in fact do you always sound the gong like that when captain is here inquired oh yes replied the domestic in question always and if missis was down master would take up the that in the and blow away like did he really how very nice mentally ejaculated house in the country ioi it is the same with everything the tain did this the captain did that all over the place begin to get rather sick of the captain the church notice is literally round the corner so there will be no excuse for not going unless give out am buddhist or mormon or house in the country called after lunch informed me that there being no country gentry round about the tenant of the old manor house is as consequence looked upon by the villagers as person of vast importance and great deal is therefore expected of him in the way of subscriptions said mildly just replied the vicar and ha ha it just occurs to me that next week we hold our village flower show in your field too by the way trust you do object the captain always lent it to us most willingly and indeed was most liberal in every way sending out tea and coffee and fruit etc as well as giving us handsome subscription hope we may count on your aid as well and with that the vicar produced little black account book containing list of sub scribers to the aforesaid show captain observed the good man in casual sort of way always gave guinea to my other charities such as the clothing club etc often but of course the amount you would like to give entirely rests with yourself merely thought would mention you understand exactly very kind of thought to myself as forked out the sum named took the opportunity of hinting to the vicara house in the country that it might save trouble if he would kindly give me list of what was expected to give to during my stay so that should know do you know the vicar delighted at the notion declined the brandy and soda offered him and left hur riedly no doubt to make out the list in question after he had left it occurred to me that should have offered him tea not brandy and soda had myself instead and went out to have look at the strawberries they were all covered over by net about three feet from the ground so lifting up cover enter and pick some eat away for ten minutes feeling something like rabbit on the warpath the while take another ten minutes straightening my back after the operation somebody else shall pick to morrow struck me in the course of the afternoon that had not seen the paper made inquiries and found that it never came until the following morning unless the milkman brought it from hate not seeing the paper so give orders that the said milkman be requested to bring it every day until further orders july standing on the lawn smoking pipe after late breakfast when am suddenly struck full on the nose by missile of some sort hoüse in the country it is the daily telegraph which the milkman has hurled over my front gate as he passes note from the vicar in course of morning enclosing the list asked him for of the different things connected with the village am expected to subscribe to during my stay am bound to say it is what would call rather at rough guess should say shall be lucky if get off under am rather sorry asked the captain man sends in after lunch to know if would like drive not if know it am cram full of straw berries and cream and dare be shaken up for worlds if the pony wants exercise tell him he had better take her out sorry told him as he returns in the evening decidedly the worse for liquor and with the tain pet pony done to turn if the captain was says the trim parlourmaid oh he would go on should like to go on but to say the truth am not particularly partial to parley with an irishman at any time especially an inebriated one so content myself with remarking gravely to the parlourmaid that trust it wo occur again fancy go down hundred per cent in the little parlourmaid estimation in consequence servants notice are particularly partial toa house in the country scene and no doubt she looked forward to in this case am way through dinner when dreadful braying outside suddenly makes me start go to the front door and find that the noise emanates from the club band who accompanied by the whole population of the village are going through performance for my benefit it is dreadful ordeal and my nerves are so unstrung by played all out of tune that feel strongly inclined to act up to the words of the song itself and lay me down and waited patiently to the end and then calling the leader of the band to me lied to him in the most extraordinary manner about the delight his talented orchestra had given me finishing up by presenting him with sovereign hoping most devoutly that he and his merry men would go straight off and spend it in drink not bit of it they went through the whole of their repertoire finishing off by singing for he jolly good veller of course me how often does the band come here inquired of the maid when having seen the last of them off the premises proceeded to go in for the quiet cigar had been longing for every wednesday was the reply house in the country they do play beautiful do they sir master and she added was both very fond of the band and master used to bring out his and them on indeed said sarcastically the effect must indeed have been lovely oh it was sir replied quite inno cently poor girl learned afterwards that her young man was in the band and played the trombone weather looks rather threatening have look at weather glass before retiring to bed going down hope it wo be wet to morrow is wet cats and not the word for it will play old harry with the straw berries put on mackintosh and go and consult the captain man find him rubbing away at curb chain smelling horribly of onions and looking as fresh as paint after his debauch of yesterday he says in answer to my inquiry after the pony health that she is all the bether for the exercoise of yesterday and is pleeful as kitten sorr this this believe to be lie as the pony looks to me rather dull and listless as to the weather he thinks turning blood shot eye to the heavens now looking their that it will be foine entoirely in the house in the country this feel sure is only said to put me in good humour for the clouds are as black as ink and there is not the slightest sign of the rain ceasing go out into the village street meet farmer and consult him answers surlily that he is of opinion that we in for long spell wet feel ought to say something about the hay but on consideration think it best not seeing that in all probability that belonging to the agricul turist in question is at this moment under process of spoiling think for second and then remark cheerily good day for fishing should ugh is the reply with growl like bear the only thing it be vit vor then he then walks off muttering to himself as he goes miserable hog your sty the best place for think to myself as retire indoors nothing for it but whisky and soda and pipes all day very pleasant but unfortunately leads to enlarged liver would give trifle for table and friend or would even object to my wife for bit rain made the house feel quite damp and chilly substitute hot toddy for the habitual and soda house in the country to bed at eleven thoroughly sick of my own company and feeling very low and depressed raining hard woke up feeling very feverish and bad nothing but nightmares one after the other all night dreamt amongst other things that my wife had bolted with captain of marines pity the captain of marines ca look at my breakfast but fancy straw berry much too wet for the opines the parlourmaid and she adds the slugs are eating of awful the slugs want to eat never ceases to pour all day and consequently nothing to do but eat drink and smoke princi pally the latter am sure my liver is getting enlarged retire to bed feeling suicidal it ask the captain own man when he enters my room with my bath water etc it is he answers but think it looks clairer than it did it be foine yit sorr get up and have look at the prospect on my own account ca say share the sanguine viewa house in the country iog takes of it for anything more gloomy never saw the captain or rather pet pigeons are all sitting huddled up on the dovecote or on the stable roof looking as if they thought being converted into pie was preferable to life under such disadvantages no strawberries plenty of whisky and though ha ha ca get at that on second thought it almost pity they ca for my liver can feel is increasing in size every hour find myself calculating how many pâtés de foie gras it would make in the hands of skilful pattiseur this ca go on bed at io house in the country another wretched night could sleep for the life of me would have given ten ner or even pony for my wife presence with of her favourite curtain lectures la they instantly act on me like laudanum is it raining ask it is sorr is his reply bury my head under the clothes instantly in order to escape the remarks in his confounded irish brogue as to its getting clairer or broighter or loighter that feel sure he is about to make get up and look out of window it is raining harder than ever and pet pigeons look positively suicidal even bantam usually as bumptious looking specimen of his race as ever beheld and an especial favourite with the tells me bekase he such divil to foight sorr quite devoid of conceit this morning and no wonder as for the strawberries it no use thinking any more of them what the slugs do eat the rain is making jam of too bad of both of them for am so fond of strawberries house in the country ill everything seems to go wrong to day the parlourmaid has got such bad headache that she is obliged to retire to her room takes her place and waits at table at luncheon he brings into the room with him fine aroma of the stable tobacco beer and onions thereby effectually doing away with what little appetite had to add to my comfort the milk man has carefully dropped my daily telegraph in the mud so that it is almost unreadable either luncheon or the smell of has turned me bilious as well as sparks are floating about in front of my eyes my liver feel sure must be by this time an enormous size think of the jaundice and find myself breaking out all over into cold perspira tion stitch in time saves so donning mackintosh go out and consult about doctor there is one close handy he tells me very young man of the name of the he adds has greet regard for for he foine shot and splindid do somehow regard these latter as any guarantee of the doctor skill however send for him all the same he be company at all think in half an hour he arrives he is as described him young man with house in the country plenty of and should imagine fair stock of assurance he looks at my tongue feels my pulse and applies the stethoscope having done which he sits down stares at me for fully couple of min utes shakes his head with great gravity and finally remarks that am very livery subject and that have had narrow shave of having some long latin word which pretend to understand and do how lucky sent for him tell him it was he replies there is no say ing otherwise what might not have he rises to go and promises to call again in the evening meanwhile if send to his house he will give him some medicine to bring back ask him to come and dine it will give him great pleasure meanwhile must not feel depressed general he goes on to inform me is very common about here some of the natives occasionally declining to go outside their houses for weeks he adds in casual sort of way as he rises to go that there are goodish many suicides hereabouts no wonder look hard at my razors of thought damn the doctor wish helhad not told me feel more depressed than house in the country try little prescription of my own large whisky and soda feel much better in conse quence arrives to dinner first of all he goes out and interviews who is still hors de combat and returning rubbing his hands evidently thinks he is in for good thing the he informs me was never ill neither was his wife they were the healthiest couple he ever saw in he says this as much as to say do think include you in the same category because we sit down to dinner say more out of compliment to the doctor than for any other reason may eat anything like may not oh yes should say so as long as you do over do it you is his reply as am not in the habit of over doing as he calls it thought this rather an insulting remark on his part nothing but contented myself with look ing at him in my sternest manner which however do think had the smallest effect as do fancy he observed it he had helps of everything distinct helps and having first solemnly warned me not on any account to touch any finished up by eating house in the country nearly the whole of large mayonnaise of lobster share as well as his own as he facetiously remarked could not help saying quietly you not overdoing it hope doctor oh dear no he replied one of those people you know who can eat anything with impunity ha ha he added with fiendish glee fancy do you know we poor devils have the best of it in the long run it only you rich fellows can afford to be fastidious what fastidious indeed confound the man cheek why if he had not forbidden me to touch it should have eaten as much lobster as he probably more cigar after supper during which the intilligent young sawbones entertained me with half the night firmly impressed with the notion that am suffering from cancer dropsy and every other disease under the sun circumstantial account of all the worst cases that he had had the treatment of both before and during his sojourn in the village with the result that lie awakea house in the country shall bar too much of that doctor in future life too short to be frightened to death like that about oneself july is it still wet it is head under the bedclothes as usual to avoid hearing lying weather forecast letter from my wife saying what delightful weather she and the dear children are having at ramsgate how much they are enjoying them selves and how she hopes am doing the same etc etc oh yes am enjoying myself rather letter from my landlord the captain at asking me how like the place he hopes it is fine because when they get spell of wet weather is not the most lively spot in the world no indeed it is not far from it think to myself feel sinking sort of feeling want of tone about the system generally that can not be right biscuit and pint of ought not to do me any harm on the contrary give me fillip for lunch am just house in the country busy discussing it when in walks the doctor who of course goes through the form of being dreadfully shocked these stimulants in the morning are very he says so apt to lead to fatty degener ation of the or words to that effect if taken in but the good wine has given me just what wanted fillip and do care for doctors and their gibberish at this moment oh nonsense reply once in way it ca hurt anyone try some yourself and if you believe it the doctor oddly enough is of my way of thinking once in says he rubbing his hands of course would not do much harm and do you know my dear sir think will indulge for to say the truth feel little depressed myself this morning and in this damp weather champagne find is most valuable calorific most valuable assure was quite right the village doc is most intelligent fellow we discuss the weather at the same time as the champagne and both agree that the one is as flat and dispiriting as is lively and in vigorating the doctor looking with flushed face out of window says he thinks it the rain looks like lasting some time and strongly advises me to ask friend down the cheeriera house in the country the better by way of keeping off the blues good chap the doctor and take his advice and write off an invitation by this very night post who shall it be that the question have young friend tolladay is the very fellow he always in chronic state of diffi

he rushed forward and held me in mock embrace to the intense amazement of the flyman the domestics and select audience of little boys and girls from the village fancy they all thought him mad and no

am in my dress clothes lying at full length on the hearth rug whilst close by is reposing grace fully with his head in the coal scuttle snoring most hideously the most respectable one fear of the lot is curled up by his master with his head resting affectionately on his breast rise in dishevelled state and look or rather blink at myself in the glass result not pleasing house in the country must wake easier said than done for every time attempt to touch him flies at my legs am at my wits end to know what to do when bright idea comes to the rescue bribe with biscuit to leave the room try it on immediately with immense success is as corruptible as the rest of find and leaves his master without moment hesitation the door shut on him have another turn at wake up come wake shout shaking him he evidently thinks he is in and that am policeman for he grunts out old and goes to sleep again the rascal wo wake at last in my despair have recourse to the water bottle and sprinkle some on his upturned countenance it has the desired effect for muttering that it confounded wet he wakes up and sitting up rubs his eyes and looks around him old boy says he as cool as cucumber why we seem to have overslept by jove never thought of grasped the idea at once was perfectly right we had overslept ourselves and soda apiece at house in the country gestion and so to bed as good would say for wonder attended church for the first time since my arrival at persuade to accom pany me after considerable difficulty nervous and shaky after last night carouse and made worse by the consciousness that every eye in the congre gation is upon me on whom anything of that sort is lost abstracts his attention carefully from the service and stares at all the pretty girls in church in turn am bound to say his behaviour is not quite so decorous as it might be the way he yawns alone setting me off too by mere force of example is enough of itself to make people stare in the course of the service an awful circum stance happened making me wish for the moment that had never been born the litany had just commenced when all of sudden there arose from outside the door prolonged howl followed by sharp bark then sound of scratching was heard and another howl for pony exclaimed in loud whisper his face crimson with suppressed laughter better go out to him or the villain will howl the place nodded assent and he was just about toa house in the country do so accordingly when as ill luck would have it the village schoolmaster who sat next the door must needs get up and open it with view of driving away the sacri legious intruder the result may be imagined in boun ded with ous yelp nearly upsetting the schoolmaster and came gallop ing up the aisle in hot haste to find his master whom directly he ran to ground he proceeded to smother with caresses dared not look up and for the rest of the service was busily engaged cudgelling my brains for pretty speech wherewith to pacify the no doubt justly scandalised vicar bright idea ask him to lunch and then we can make it up over bottle of cut along home whispered at the end of the service and follow on want to speak to the vicar for moment in the not bit abashed collared under his arm and walked out of the church with the rest whilst made for the vestry profuse in my apologies for my friend dog house in the country vicar polite but somewhat cool and distant thought accepted my invitation to luncheon all the same and having doffed his surplice and had word or with his clerk walked home with me unbent as we went along shying stones at pet pigeons looking on and barking introduced the vicar who eyed him with evident distrust very fine and large specimen of the wicked no doubt he thought full of fun as usual gravely introduced the vicar to his dog as you saw him in church of laughed he ha ha always thought until to day that was hindoo or dissenter or something of that sort do you know but he is evidently one of us eh sir the vicar smiled feebly evidently failing to see the point of the joke was thankful when luncheon was announced not out of the wood even then must needs put his foot into it again before we had sat down ten minutes lots of pretty faces in church noticed this morning me quite forget your name for the my name is said the vicar with freezing bow oh ah yes of course howa house in the country stupid of went on well as was observing saw several pretty faces in church this morning one in particular the charmer who played the harmonium girl in white dress and large straw hat doosed pretty girl thought she the young lady you allude to replied the vicar getting very red in the face and glaring through his spectacles at the unconscious is my daughter my daughter sir really replied not in the least taken aback you do say so now come to think of it do see somewhat of after this the conversation got somewhat io house in the country strained the vicar listening grimly whilst gave graphic account of particularly noisy dinner he had partaken of with some boon com panions at on the previous sunday directly the meal was over the vicar hurried off glad to escape fancy good day to said he to with freezing politeness he added sar castically we need not hope to see you at our evening service well it is rather replied cheerily but tell you what here shall go if you want to make up crowd go along with jimmy pretty parlourmaid eh jimmy capital idea call it this was the last and the poor vicar fairly bolted in disgust and said to be done dear boy got any bowls on the premises no sorry for that because we have had game then there nothing for it old fellow that can see but cigar and the pink we adjourned accordingly to the room and having stretched himself out on the sofa with large cigar in his mouth and his favourite newspaper in his hand thought we were in for quiet afternoon was premature it seemed however for just as was comfortably nodding over novel my volatile friend jumped up and startled me with house in the country say old boy have you got cow on these oily old anorial premises of yours eh because if you have got the finest idea for spending an day you ever heard of in your life but the cow is essential have you got one replied that there were in milk he enquired in answered indeed has just weaned calf and has got more than usual in that first exclaimed now go down

we meet again leaving in hurry like this rather upsets one apple cart do you know house in the country never knew the time when apple cart was not being upset or that he did not want the useful sum he mentioned however was much too seedy to refuse now so having got what he wanted he shortly after took his departure driving him over to or rather should say he driving in the captain pony cart was enjoying blissful doze lying asleep awake when the noise of voices whispering and the sound of the rustling of petti coats roused me from my reverie my wife had arrived îjî ïjî week hence we left my wife characterising it as the most dead alive place she was ever in in her life more than that have promised her never again to take house in the got at trainer trainer story you may talk of jockeys and stable boys being got at from time to time by unscru pulous people and betraying the secrets of their employers in order to put few paltry pounds into their own dis honest pockets but never of them be bound to say was ever got at so neatly as myself was some years ago by lady too the artful little puss lord when think of how was taken in and done for it makes me positively wild it does indeed thus spoke genial the well known trainer at whose hospitable table had just par taken of most excellent lunch after delightful morning spent in his company on horley down watching the doings of the long string of race horses under his charge got at you do say so replied why you the very last person in the world should have thought anybody could have wormed any thing out of that you wanted to keep to yourself how was it am really quite anxious to know well if you fill up your glass and light of these cigars handing me box of the latter as he spoke tell you all about it said though added he positively ashamed to do so for it tells so against myself you understand at the time am speaking of began had not long commenced my career as public trainer and as you may imagine was naturally anxious to make name for myself in the racing world with all possible speed especially as had married wife and had got young family springing up around me luck has good deal to do with success in our profession as no doubt you are aware trainer may go on for years and have succession of bad horses in his stable or what is worse almost he may have perhaps good or which he expects to do wonders and then they break down or go wrong in some way or another at the last moment there is nothing in my opinion so aggravating heart breaking may say to trainer as break down to the favourite generally speaking within few days of the race he is going for the racing public little know all the anxieties the sleeplessgot at nights the endless worries that fall to the lot of the trainer it is thankless task too for if he does succeed in getting his charge talking mind of delicate horse to the post and he wins it is the jockey always it seems to me who gets all the fat in the way of praise from the public at large at all events it is the jockey not the trainer upon whom all the presents are lavished after the race but to return to my story in this particular year had horses in my stable all belonging to owner the late the north country millionaire all good ones the worst of the indeed being far above the average and all entered for the you can imagine therefore the anxiety of the british public who were followers of wood jock as they called him to man to find out which was the from amongst the illustrious quartette that would carry the stable money on the day they very naturally went for the best public performer of the lot as two year old and this was who had won all his races including the at and the criterion at newmarket and was in consequence firm winter favourite for the blue riband un fortunately for their judgment and as rule the public mind you are right we had another one at home who owing to temporary ailments of sort and another had never been able to be rattled along and got properly fit for his engagements got at but had been tried at home to be better than any thing in the stable this was chestnut colt by the marquis out of convention called house an especial favourite with whose greatest hope was to win the with him and with it large stake in bets which latter he could easily do with comparatively small outlay seeing that the chesnut was the worst favourite of the lot scarcely mentioned in fact in the betting whereas it was hard to obtain any thing like decent price about play actor with the spring coming on and not shilling of stable money as yet on the outsider you can imagine how important it was to keep claverhouse real merits to ourselves must tell you that though entered in the two thousand guineas we had no intention of running him therein the idea being to win it with if possible starting stable companion called sharpshooter to make the running for him if play actor won which contingency none of us doubted for moment he would naturally become very warm indeed for the and we should be consequently able to get on the real article at long odds to win perfect fortune well the guineas was drawing nigh and was coming home with the horses one morning when who should come across on the road just as we were leaving the but lady standing all by herself as rum looking an old girl as you see anywhere ii fair stranger on the got at and quite one of the blue stocking order ap parently she had ringlets and red nose pair of blue spectacles broad brimmed hat cotton gloves and dowdy old dress with ap parently no petticoats underneath and pair of awful boots with the tags hanging out to finish up with could see she wanted to ask me thing so pulled up my pony and inquired if could be of any service oh she replied indeed you can have you may ask seen anything of maidservant carrying basket and butterfly net looking as if she was in search of anybody the fact is only arrived in these parts yesterday having taken myrtle cottage on the axminster road for the summer and going out for walk on the downs this lovely morning suddenly found that there were quantities of the most bee ootiful blue butter flies flitting about am great entomologist you must know so immediately sent my maid back for my butterfly net telling her to bring out my luncheon with her at the same time and where she can have got to goodness only knows and here am so frightened and tired really do know what to the poor old thing looked so flustered and put out that hang me if did think she meant faint ing or something so down got and suggested as we were of mile from my house that she should come on with me and wouldgot at drive her home later on accordingly offered her my arm as polite as possible and she took it in the most gracious fashion thanking me over and over again thought she would never have done indeed she informed me going along that her name was trimmer miss and that she was the only daughter of the late admiral of whom perhaps might possibly have heard in connection with the baltic fleet in the crimean war no well she was surprised at that for the late admiral was most distinguished officer having pretty well worn out the subject of herself she must needs begin about the horses who were walking along just ahead of us what pretty creatures they were what darlings so quiet too did this one go in harness you should have seen the face of the lad on the back of when she said this and do you give them all names what do you call this dear creature with the white legs then claverhouse oh dear how charming how very charming he reminds me very much of horse that my late papa the admiral used to drive about years ago at he died one day right in the middle of the promenade there just as we were driving home from an archery party at the and remember so well my papa the admiral who was quite what people term sea dog calling him such dreadfulgot at names and shouting to him get up you lub ber but of course the poor thing could get up when he was dead could he when poor dear found he was really dead am sorry to say that he called him wickeder names than ever for daring to depart this life at such short notice or without any notice at all as one might say in such public place was it shocking hope you never swear at your horses beg your pardon mean and have only to look at your face to know that the name is quite in accordance with your character or am no judge of physiognomy you do only at the lads occasionally and no doubt they richly deserve it the young rascals at and so she went on all the way to the house oh she was can tell you well sir in she came and having made her and the missus acquainted went to see after the horses while dinner was getting ready bless you when came back there she was sitting along side of my wife on the sofa as thick the pair of as if they had known each other for years miss had got the baby on her lap vowing it was the finest she had ever seen and she had seen good many whilst my little boy was snuggling by her side trying with all his might to examine the interior arrangements of her gold watch with all the confidence imaginable dinner was announced soon after and missgot at made as hearty as ever saw she said the lamb was delicious and the cham pagne exactly as she liked it neither too dry nor too sweet afterwards when we adjourned to the room she was pleased to give us little music particularly fond of music so she sat down to the piano and sang home sweet home to us in manner that went to our hearts my wife who had lately lost her mother fairly sobbed and as for me am susceptible man and own it felt as soft as ever did in my life the odd thing was that the croaking way she had when she talked seemed entirely to have dis appeared and her voice when she sang was that of fresh young girl it was the most remarkable thing ever knew another thing noticed too was that for such an aged one as she was she had of the most lovely rows of teeth ever saw that though did not think much of for as my wife remarked afterwards when mentioned it to her they get up those things so well nowadays that it impossible almost to tell the real from the the end of it was that the sprightly miss having stayed to tea took as affectionate farewell of my wife little and the new baby as if she was on the eve of departure for and finally went off to myrtle cottage in my pony carriage bound down in her got at recognisances to pay us another visit before the week was out well said my wife as soon as she was out of sight she not much to look at that certain but that the dearest old soul met with for many long day the way she took to baby and baby took to her did my own precious was something wonderful sure she wants to be its godmother she hinted as much and what good thing that would be for am certain she rich and too before she went away she gave him tell father what the lady gave you replied grinning with pleasure exclaimed his mother what does the child mean it ma he said it was said producing bran new sovereign as he spoke from out of of the pockets of his knickerbockers why it thick he trying to explained to his mother who was not best pleased at her son and heir picking up such low expressions as she called them and requested me to keep him out of the stable lad company as much as possible for the future did not expect to see our new friend quite so soon again however the very next morning as was out on the with the horses it hadgot at been very wet in the early part so did take them out until after breakfast who should see in the distance running in the most frisky manner after the small blue butterflies that are found in such quantities on the about here with large green net but our new friend could do otherwise you know than ride up and inquire how she was so did accordingly of course nothing would serve her but she must come and see the horses meanwhile it appeared she had driven on to the in her pony cart which she had left in the road and which now went and fetched for her and very neat turnout it was too little pinewood village cart drawn by just about the prettiest little pony you ever saw and driven by good looking maid having pioneered her to her mistress we joined the string once more and by and by sent the lot gallop much to the amiable spinster delight who apparently took the keenest interest in the proceedings naturally take pride in my horses consequently could not but be gratified at her encomiums on their condition and good looks and should have been still more pleased had she not made so many silly remarks such as comparing my charges to her late stud and so on remarks that clearly showed she did not know horse from another she took tremendous fancy by the way to who certainly was as handsome as paint butj got at rather peacocky gentleman withal and not patch as regards looks on claverhouse who was as near perfect as possible in every respect why do you think she was so fond of she said ha ha ha laughed at the bare recollection why because his beautiful brown coat had such polish upon it when his clothes were removed that it reminded her of her papa the admiral mahogany dining table when the butler removed the cloth after dinner previous to putting on the dessert did you or anybody else ever hear of such comparison scarcely day passed now without either my self or my wife seeing something of her either she would be on the catching butterflies when was there with the horses or else she would drive up in her cart to the house to see how little and her future god daughter were thriving and as she never came without present of some sort for somebody locket for my wife on her birthday some sugar plums or toys for or rattle for the baby her visits needless to say were very welcome to my family if rather irksome to myself it was within week of the guineas when one afternoon as was sitting at tea with my wife miss who had dropped in as usual making one of the party telegram was brought to me which at once opened and read anything particular inquired my at well replied it from saying that he and lord and some friends are coming on saturday by the ten train from town so that you have to look up your best bib and old girl and see that the commissariat department is in good order they take lunch directly they arrive no doubt and the trial must be in the afternoon as and tiny coates ca get here from to take part in it until one trial broke in our visitor oh am so fond of trials must come too may where is it tell me all about it why you never seen trial surely said looking at miss in astonishment oh have was the confident reply why attended regularly every day in november last year when that dreadful woman was tried at the old bailey for poisoning her poor husband and fainted clean away the moment the learned judge produced his black cap oh yes and been to ever so many in the divorce court besides oh you do know me see my dear ah the trial am talking of is of very different kind to those you have witnessed and am afraid wo interest you much merely galloping our horses together just to see which is the best do you at oh but should like to see it all the same if declared my persistent visitor well have no objection said if you do mind sitting in our bedroom you can see it all from the window oh that will be lovely exclaimed in real or affected rapture how good it is of you to gratify all my foolish little fancies well saturday came and with it my employer accompanied by lord his confidential friend and adviser and of the most knowing cards on the turf sir another swell who was born yesterday as the saying is and captain the well known gentle man rider our first act after luncheon was to make dash for touts who were on the watch in small plantation hard by these we collared after struggle and having brought them along in triumph locked them into barn until our business was over that feat accomplished out came the horses and having mounted the jockeys from new market on play actor and claverhouse and lads on the other the trial duly came off with no onlookers besides ourselves on the spot and poor dear harmless old miss at my bedroom window no need to describe the trial suffice it to say the result proved to us most conclusively that claverhouse was in his very best form and that bar accident the wasgot at as great certainty for him as the was for play actor directly after the race the public would be sure to rush on at short price whilst and his friends were quietly taking all the long shots about his stable companion poor public thought though not by any means capitalist may add that before the party left for the station requested so good thing did deem it to let me stand in with him to the tune of monkey on play actor and claverhouse respectively and an extra on the double event was precious cock hoop when sat down to tea can tell you sir and my first words were well miss do you want to back the winner of the at because if you do now your time one good gracious me exclaimed miss here let me see if put this ten pound note on that dear whom am so fond of shall win ten noughts are nought ten fives are why that should really win five hundred pounds oh dear how useful it would be just now for that orphanage am so interested in and so in want of funds too as that good man the reverend wrote me word only last week that what you win suregot at replied only you would not do it by putting it on claverhouse is the one between you and me and the post wo run in the at miss as woman of business grasped the situation readily that of course explains it at she said understand exactly all about it is the better horse but for reasons of your own you are not going to let him compete in this great equine contest that is so is it not very good then here is my ten pound note for immediate investment on claverhouse what do you call the race the oh yes shall remember that until get home and then will write it down think of the song and know it daresay and then sure to remember all right miss said laughing as put her ten pound note in my pocket and wished her good evening see to it for you this very next monday and if you not gainer of five hundred pounds by the transaction may never execute commission for lady again well sir won the two thousand though not quite so easily as anticipated and of course the public made him favourite for the the odd part of it was though that when our commissioner put in feeler by way of seeing what he could get about claverhouse hegot at found to his astonishment that every one of the big books had been snapped up previous to the race for the guineas here was pretty go and how to account for it did not know not tout looked on at the trial that was certain for we scoured the only place of concealment they had little plantation on the downs thoroughly and locked them up in barn afterwards as have already described the stable commissioner himself was not even aware of our tactics until after the two thousand the only person literally who knew anything was poor harmless old who by the way my wife wrote me word to had been suddenly telegraphed for to to the bedside of sick relative and to think of her in the matter was simply absurd the upshot was that and his friends instead of getting the long prices about claverhouse they expected had to put up with what they could get it was sell of course somebody for once was cleverer than we were and who that somebody was we should uncommonly have liked to have found out we managed to discover who the taker of most of the long shots was certain gay young spark named who until lately had held com mission in of her majesty cavalry or infantry regiments forget which and who having got tired of the army had taken to the turf he was after due consideration written to on the subject got at and was threatened by that if he did not disgorge some of the spoil claverhouse would have the pen struck through his name for the instanter what do you think this impu dent young dog reply was you ca guess no should think not indeed it was simply this scratch away old fellow yours in liquor old jock hazelwood was in such rage when he got this reply to his letter that really think he would have scratched the horse if he could have at got decent price about but there again he was forestalled by the public so as have said he had to make the best of bad job at and get the best price he could the commission believe averaged to all round when the money was got on and not before was withdrawn from the to the chagrin of the public for whom am bound to say felt sorry had the horse run though he would never have beaten claverhouse who was street in front of him and who won in canter so it was all the same in the long run had been so busy with my charges previous to the that had hardly given miss thought however on our return from epsom for took the missus you may be sure we found letter from her dated from an hotel in congratulating me on claverhouse victory and saying that she was returning to myrtle cottage on the following monday and would do herself the pleasure of driving over in company with friend who would be with her to see us the very next day if it would not put us out she added she would come to luncheon at one then my wife and were on the look out at the front door and very shortly we saw the well known village cart drawn by the pretty pony coming along at best pace but as it neared the house my wife suddenly exclaimed why who on earthcanitbe it her pony cart right enough but the lady driving is not miss and there gentleman along with her whom never seen before to my well up to the door they drove and handinggot at the reins to her companion out the lady as pretty girl as ever saw jumped running up to my astonished wife she gave her hearty kiss and then coming up to me held out her hand and said in the croaking well remembered voice of how do got any trials going forward to day for me to look on at out of your bedroom window nearly tumbled backwards into the passage in my astonishment and the truth of the whole business flashed across my mind in an instant there was no longer any mystery as to how it was that we were forestalled in the market lord how had been fooled and by woman too forgive me both of said the whilom sportive holding out pretty little hand to each of us plead for your bad wicked god mother cried she seeing suppose that looked rather put out appealing to the baby and stooping over to kiss it as it lay in the nurse girl arms the baby in answer held out its little arms and cooed as much as to say do all she snatched the child away from its nurse and smothered it in kisses who could resist such an appeal from young and pretty woman my wife who of course began to cry and hugged the fair penitent on the spot could for one and could for another and said she after returning the baby to the nursemaid and turning to the gentleman in got at the cart having made it up all round suppose introduce to you my husband well of course we made friends with him too and we sat down five minutes afterwards to lunch the merriest party of that ever my dining room had inside its walls open con fession is good for the they say and when the cloth was cleared and the servant had left the room née made clean breast of the matter and told us all about it she was an actress she informed us yes and first rate one too thought to myself when fell in love with her and married her and as his father quarrelled with him in consequence and he had nothing to live upon but small sum left him by his mother he left the army and went in for the turf mentioning one day to his pretty wife that he thought he could make his fortune straight away if he could only ascertain which was the right of lot for the she determined to give him the benefit of her experience on the stage and endeavour to find out accordingly they took myrtle cottage and down she came got up in the character of sportive her first appearance in the part as she said with what success you are aware her husband landed the best part of forty thousand pounds on the double event for which he had to thank his wife entirely judging bygot at the affectionate glances saw him perpetually stealing at her fancy he was not ungrateful that loving cup you see on the sideboard yonder with an equestrian model of the celebrated of claverhouse on the lid was their joint present to me in honour of having trained the winner of the as for the presents lavished on her little god daughter and to say nothing of my wife they were too numerous to mention the boys came in too for their share the boy who looked after claverhouse especially having reason to remember bounty but what pleased me most of all was that the little woman kept her word to the letter about giving the five hundred won for her on colt to charity for she divided every penny of it amongst different useful institutions in need of help so you see some good came after all from my being got the queen of the piteen of fije mu chapter you do really know what has become of ca give me the slightest clue to her present whereabouts indeed indeed do you might trust me sir to tell you if did even if had forbidden me to tell soul would have broken my promise to her on your account would truly but since she went away after the sale of the old place just fifteen months ago had no tidings good or bad of her saw her off poor dear in the train to third class ticket she took she as had never travelled in any other but first class carriage in all her born days before and that the very last saw of her you let me hear from you from time to time wo said just before the queen of the arena train moved off and she promised me she would sir but except letter with no address saying that she had arrived safe and sound iir london and was looking out for employment have never heard from her from that day to this or whether even the poor darling is alive or dead no more know than you do and that gospel truth it is indeed eldest son of country clergy man and lieutenant in her majesty navy had left in his ship just two years before for lengthened cruise in the mediterranean having previous to leaving plighted his troth to sweet the only daughter and child of of headley court close by his father rectory of large family and his father having little besides the stipend derived from his living fortunately for him good the chance of speedy marriage for the lovers seemed remote afraid nelly we shall have to wait long while said with sigh promotion is slow you know darling and feel certain your father would object to anybody under post captain fear so too dear was reply nestling her head as she spoke upon her lover shoulder but am not afraid to wait dear ifthe queen of the arena you are not she continued looking bravely up into his face and trying her hardest with but poor success to restrain the tears that would keep welling up into those liquid violet eyes of hers at the thought of the inevitable parting on the morrow the lovers corresponded regularly at first nelly letters were as cheerful as could be and evidently written in the best of spirits after while however always anxious as true lover should be fancied he could detect false ring about the apparent light heartedness assumed by the writer was there some hidden trouble he knew nothing about to make his brave little girl unhappy he thought to himself he chafed and worried himself so at the bare idea as to cause his messmates to wonder what on earth was the matter with their friend as rule as jolly sailor as ever broke bit of biscuit tooth or swateheart me boy inquired rallying his brother officer after his quaint irish fashion on his lowness of spirits if it your swateheart sure and symathoize with ye heartily yes indeed know is perpetually making me feel unasy the decateful little divil and many toime do feel inclined to say good to ye all and jump overboard because of her oh it miss the flirt intirely never mind me boy said the good hearted irishman taking his the queen of the arena arm as he spoke come down in the gun room and we have glass of grog and forget all about her was not kept long in suspense for in next letter out came the secret she was very very unhappy she wrote so unhappy ed could think my poor little girl exclaimed the love sick lieutenant at this point giving the letter fond kiss ere he resumed reading she was sure something dreadful had happened to some terrible money loss she feared by his manner he wandered aimlessly about all day and at night contrary to his wo nt for as rule he was the most abstemious of men when by himself drank heavily she had begged him tothe queen of the let her share his trouble whatever it was but he refused tried to laugh away her fears indeed by assuring her it was only her fancy that he was merely out of sorts strange men too had been to the house to see him whose visits had the effect of leaving him more depressed and queer in his manner than ever she wound up by saying that she could not help thinking losses on the turf had got something to do with it for instead of going to for the autumn meetings taking her with him as he usually did he had this year for the first time in her recollection announced his intention of remaining at home she was sorry for this for both their sakes for they always did him good those visits to and if there was amusement in this world she liked more than another it was galloping about on the it was second only to hunting in her estimation and that was saying good deal was terribly exercised in his mind about this letter he had heard when he was last in sundry rumours of heavy losses on the turf his father the vicar indeed had told him gravely on occasion that if the went on much longer as he was then doing he very soon would not have roof over his head he had taken little heed however of the remark at the time knowing as he did the vicar prejudice against racing and its attendant the queen of the arena he had no doubt now in his own mind that was right in her conjecture and that the had sustained such loss as to bring about serious crisis in his affairs all he could do was to hope for the best and await the arrival of the next batch of letters for further news with what anxiety he waited may well be imagined and could he have foreseen the news that was in store for him when they did arrive he would indeed have found it hard to contain his feelings it was nearly three months after he had received letter telling him the trouble she was in about her father that ironclad the to which edward arden belonged arrived off in due course the letters for the ship amongst them for which he hastily took to his cabin to read better come into the gun room and have glass of grog first me boy if your heart gone off with another chap it cheer ye up and make ye careless like sung out his irish friend who had evidently not got letter from his swateheart as he called the pretty girl who was waiting patiently in until her sailor boy saw his way to marrying her but paying no heed to his friend natured chaff hurried down into his cabin and at once proceeded to overhaul his letters hethe queen of the arena saw was from nelly from his father and the other superscription was in strange hand he opened his father first at the same time you receive this wrote you will doubtless get the formal intima tion from your late uncle the admiral lawyers of the good fortune that has befallen you my poor brother should tell you died last week you are rich man now my dear what on earth does he mean exclaimed and pray as such accept all our heartiest congratula tions of course you will now say good bye to the navy get leave for the present at all events and come home as fast as you can so far the contents of his father letter had only astonished him but the next and concluding paragraph fairly horrified him thus it ran and now must give you piece of bad news as long ago predicted there has been complete crash at the court the being missing one evening at dinner time search was made with the result that he was found lying dead in the park the doctors said it was heart but have reason from something that has come to my knowledge since to think otherwise it is sad business and feel his loss terribly for he was good friend to me and gentleman every inch of the queen of the arena misfortune did not end here am sorry to say on the affairs being gone into carefully it came out that he had been gambling for years to an extent that we none of us even dreamt of not only was he himself absolutely penniless when he died but unfortunately poor nelly fortune has gone with the rest she having sold her reversionary interest short time ago no doubt for the purpose of helping her father poor girl the whole estate in fact everything has been sold and believe the sum realised did not cover the debts by of course we offered home here but she was not to be persuaded and went off to early one morning before any of us were aware of her intention taking with her the chesnut hunter that the bred and which she was so fond of what has become of her none of us know as she has never communicated with soul since she left she was always wild wayward girl but we were all fond of her and do hope she is in good hands happy of course she can not be know you will be sorry for your old playmate in her great affliction sorry oh god groaned poor hurling his father letter to the ground in frenzy of grief fancy talking in that callous heartless way of my poor little girl my mother and sisters and all of them probably calling her because shethe queen of the arena declined to stay at the vicarage suppose in their narrow mindedness they thought it would be good for her to look at the dear old home she loved so well every time she went to the window pah it makes me sick to think of it think can see her poor darling going off to broken hearted but as brave as ever but your trouble shall not last long not long it will go hard if do find you out wherever you may be before many weeks if not days are over my head in his excitement had quite overlooked letter he now tore it open and read as follows dearest all is over between us forever my poor father is dead and leave here to morrow for good and all to seek my livelihood try and forget that we ever met it is very very hard but it will be best for the last time dear good bye and so you gone to to seek your livelihood eh mused poor little girl sighed he fancy can see her at this moment trudging along through the snow with that same plucky look on her face that have seen come over it when she was riding at bigger fence than usual out hunting seeking for situation as governess in highly respectablq the queen of the arena family or companion to an elderly lady or some thing equally unpleasant never mind your troubles wo last very long now not if can help it at least and having first impressed kiss on his lost mistress missive placed it carefully away in certain prettily worked note case black satin embroidered with blue forget me nots heaved deep sigh and proceeded to turn his attention to the remaining letter which still lay unopened on the table it proved to be the very one mentioned by his father as likely to be received at the same time as his own viz from the solicitors to his late uncle admiral the letter which was long one was in effect notification that their late client had bequeathed to his nephew edward arden whom by the way he had never so much as seen the whole of his property left him everything he possessed in fact and as that everything was good for the admiral besides being decidedly well off was of penurious not to say miserly disposition father the vicar was not very far out when he told his son that he was now to all intents and purposes rich man the lawyer after passing sundry encomiums on his late client many virtues etc went on to con gratulate his successor on succeeding to such fine property any instructions it should please him to give to his firm he might depend wouldthe queen of the arena receive their very best attention he took the liberty too of mentioning that should be in want of any ready money for imme diate use he begged he would draw upon the firm to any amount gave prolonged whistle well exclaimed he wonders will never cease that very certain an hour ago was miserable lieutenant in the navy with not copper beyond my pay and now here am bloated landed proprietor with year and bigger swell than the skipper himself my poor old uncle hated my father too it my belief it was my being in the navy did the busi ness well it rare bit of luck anyhow and be off and show the letter to the captain at once by jove exclaimed as he gathered up the said letter and prepared to leave the cabin if only knew where my was and could feel assured that all was right with her should be the happiest man in the universe at the present moment the queen of the arena chapter ii being readily ob tained from the who whilst congratula ting his lieu tenant on the stroke of good luck that had come to him took the op portunity at the same time of expressing his regret that the service was about to lose such promising young officer made the best of his way to as fast as he could arrived there his first act before even going to the pater nal rectory was to make straight for headley court this he found shut up and in charge of caretaker who being stranger in these parts as she said of course knew nothing of poor at the west lodge she thought the most likely person to give him any information he required ah of course the very person wonder didthe queen of the arena not think of her before exclaimed brighten ing up for he suddenly recollected that was nelly old nurse of whom she was very fond and consequently the most likely per son of any to know her whereabouts thanking the woman for her trouble he jumped impetuously into his hired fly and bade the driver go to the lodge as hard as he could was at home and that glad to see the lieutenant as she could express she told him but alas the moment he mentioned name her face fell for as has been already related at the commencement of this story she was unable to give him any information about her whatever at first he thought that the old nurse was deceiving him purposely nelly possibly having forbidden her to betray her whereabouts indeed he hinted as much however stuck to her story with such pertinacity and seemed so hurt at his sugges tion that he had no alternative at last but to believe her grieved and disappointed he bade the flyman drive to the vicarage with his things and say that he would follow on foot to say the truth he felt strongly inclined to go back to town there and then and probably would have done so but for the fear of being thought unfeeling by those at home the fact was he could not bear the sightthe queen of the arena of the place now there was no nelly on the scene and always sensitive he dreaded the remarks his parents and sisters would be sure to make about the fiasco at the court the latter were well mean ing girls enough but as is often the case with people who live all their lives buried in country village narrow minded to degree they had never either been very intimate with the daughter for not only did they not possess single taste in common but had always politely declined assisting at sewing classes ings and such like institutions all of which were needless to say extensively patronised by and her daughters though in spite of this terrible remissness on her part was made very welcome in the cot tages whenever she paid any of them visit the inmates liked to look at her pretty face as they said and listen to her pleasant talk so different to the miss who were always bouncing in and out of their cottages and cramming re ligion down their throats whether they liked it or no those ladies on the whole by no means approved of their brother undisguised admira tion for and were perpetually making spiteful little speeches about her for his especial benefit speeches which made him wince again and long to retaliate in no measured terms but for fear of showing his hand for they knew noth the queen of the arena ing whatever they might suspect of the true state of affairs between and their brother what pity it is that when she sings is so dreadfully theatrical in her manner her voice is really very tolerable one but in my opinion she takes away all pleasure to her hearers by singing in the forced style she does thus the eldest miss for the benefit of her family generally as they walk back from dinner party at headley court poor she had had the ill fortune to be taught by the eminent mistress who had taken her in hand not only how to use her voice but to pronounce her words so that people could hear and understand what she was singing about passionately fond of her art and sympathetic to degree she seemed to pour her whole soul into her song and it was this that gave offence to the virtuous miss those ladies on the contrary would go through series of duets such as oh wert thou in cauld blast etc in manner calculated to freeze one blood on the hottest night no wonder then that fond though he was of his family should rather dread facing the other words having to sit down and look pleasant whilst his amiable sisters made disparaging and uncharitable remarks on the person he loved best in the whole of the wide the queen of the arena as he walked along smoking cigar there were things he made up his mind to do was to keep his temper whatever was said the other to be off to the very first thing in the morning the whole of his family were assembled at the front door evidently on the look out for him as towmi entered the vicarage demesne and he was imme diately seized and gushed at by the female portion until he was nearly breathless they were indeed all unfeignedly glad to see him and momentarythe queen of the arena sensation of remorse struck when his mother remarked in an injured tone of voice we thought dear you would have come here straight from the station the proverbial fatted calf was killed to greater extent than usual that evening in honour of our hero arrival and his coming into his uncle property to the latter event may possibly be attributed the appearance during dinner of champagne wine hitherto quite unknown at the vicarage table the miss positively got quite frothy under its genial influence and in the excitement of discussing their brother windfall and trying to find out what he meant to do with all his money etc etc they totally forgot to fire off spiteful little shots against absent which they had expressly prepared for the occasion for which dispensation of provi dence needless to say was exceedingly grateful after dinner however when the ladies had retired and had the vicar all to himself he lost no time in begging his father to tell him all he knew about the sad affair at the court and nelly in particular about the former the old gentleman as mat ter of course had plenty to say and could have gone on indeed if necessary all night about it but as regards he was no wiser thanthe queen of the arena himself he had offered her home an invitation which ha hem she thought fit to decline the good vicar here put on his most pompous manner she never made confidante of your mother and sisters which really think she might have done after knowing us all her life as she had and finally hem hem she left the place by stealth might almost say and went off to with no other companion but that horse of hers queer girl queer the vicar shaking his head solemnly as he filled himself glass of wine and passed the decanter on to his son saw that he could do no good by seeking further information in that quarter so he very wisely changed the subject tired as he was it was but sleepless night that he passed under the paternal roof his mother in the adjoining room heard her first born pacing up and down impatiently long before day break and attributing it at once to her own pet ailment caught no doubt on board that horrid damp draughty ship went down to breakfast armed with an infallible remedy for the same she always carried about her in small bottle the smell of which was of ous nature and pervaded her whole person which she had made up her mind to administer to him on the spot adding an injunction to remain in histhe queen of the arena own room all day the infallible remedy being of not the slightest avail without that accompani ment poor all her trouble had been taken for nothing on entering the breakfast room she found her son as she expected looking ill and careworn her daughters sulky and the vicar evidently by his manner put out about some thing she was not long in finding out the reason had just given out his intention of leaving them that very morning for the queen of the arena chapter iii is it too bad of this dreadful frost to put in an appearance the very first day of your visit too it really looks as if the clerk of the weather does not approve of your hunting and has done it on purpose too is of our best meets and we should have been sure of run not only that wanted to show you that pretty girl we were all talking about last night who has been down hunting in these parts lately and who swam the river and pounded the whole field last week wish knew who she is she is so pretty give anything to know her thus pretty his hostess to our friend now no longer detri mental but man of property and in consequence most welcome guest in country houses more especially those in which there were marriageable daughters who had arrived at longfield park the night before with couple of hunters for the doublethe queen of the arena purpose of having day or with the old away of the most celebrated packs in and shooting the coverts and who now appeared in the breakfast room arrayed in suit of comfortable looking tweed instead of the scarlet coat snowy leathers etc he had hoped to have worn and would have but for the inter vention of that inveterate enemy to fox hunters was quite as disappointed as sporting for though fond of shooting hunting or rather should say riding over country suited his complaint as he himself would say far better am afraid was an indifferent sportsman in the true sense of the word for he knew nothing and probably cared less for the science of fox hunting drawing wood especially big one fidgeted the impetuous sailor to death nearly but when they got away and the galloping and jumping set in in earnest then he was altogether in his element an indifferent horseman and possessing not an atom of judg ment he atoned for both deficiencies by the reck less way in which he rode always as the master said as if he had spare neck or in his pocket when he first took up his abode at his late uncle the admiral house and started hunting down there the or crack men of the hunt men who not only possessed nerve butigo the queen of the arena judgment as well angry at new comer ousting them from their position went out with the full intention of taking the shine out of him as they termed it but it was no good master reckless horsemanship backed up as it was by the good cattle he rode proved too many for them and they were forced at last much against their will to give in jump over some big posts and rails on to the line right in front of an express train leav ing him some fields ahead with the hounds all to himself effectually settling the question of supremacy even the huntsman declared that he never saw such an audacious chap to ride in all his born days it was now nearly twelvemonth since of the arena igl left the navy and set up as country gentleman and though he had been indefatigable in his search for nelly both on his own account and through paid agents yet he had not as yet been able to find single trace of her he began to fear the worst and his gloomy thoughts concerning almost drove him mad at times no wonder he rode in the reckless style he did it was his only solace poor fellow shooting somehow did not answer the same pur pose at all his thoughts would keep wandering to his lost sweetheart in spite of him causing his friends to declare as they watched rocketer after rocketer fly away unhurt that though there was no denying the fact that could ride like good one he was shocking bad performer with gun the match making mammas too could make him out at all sailors as rule said they are only too fond of flirting with every pretty girl they meet but this young fellow seems quite an exception to the general rule and they put him down at last as of those silly selfish young men who care for nothing but their hunting and other horrid amusements you see these good ladies knew nothing about we left at breakfast in country house lamenting the sudden appearance of the queen of the arena hunting of course being out of the question there was nothing for it but for the host and his guests to have resource to their guns pour passer le temps accordingly word having been sent to the head keeper that the house party intended beating some of the small coverts near home the guns were got out and all were ready for start when as if the elements were determined to spoil sport down came the snow ah well we done brown now and no mis take exclaimdd keenest of nimrods and man never happy unless in the pursuit of some sort of sport or other no matter what snowing hard and looks like lasting too continued he with glance of disgust out of the window at the gloomy landscape beyond there nothing for it now you fellows afraid but and billiards billiards and my boy give you ten in and play you for fiver there was indeed nothing for it as the observed but an adjournment to the billiard room where later on they were joined by and the ladies staying in the house very noisy pool was in full swing when the door opened and there entered sprightly lady of decidedly sport ing appearance at whose arrival shout of ap proval went up from all present prettiest and blythest of her sex was indeed popular character with both highthe queen of the arena and low the men worshipped her and even the ladies liked her which is saying great deal sha like that woman know thought to himself as the new arrival chattered away with the greatest volubility chaffing everybody right and left and making the billiard room ring again with her laughter he was not fond of these very sporting ladies as rule but in the brief space of half an hour how ever this lively lady had somehow or another entirely made him change his opinion and by the time the luncheon gong sounded like the rest had become one of her most devoted admirers and now my dear exclaimed she addressing what do you think what do you think driven over here for this nasty snowy day what should you say if told you had found out all about the girl in the brown habit who has been down here hunting of late and cut us all down one after the other no exclaimed in her turn her friend clapping her hands with delight do tell me all about her rose dying to know sure she got history said so from the first now has she well restrain yourself you impetuous replied her friend and you shall hear all about it you were out last wednesday you little the queen of the arena stupid when we had that good thing from tackley wood but no doubt whom know to be raconteur of the first water told you all about it so need not enlarge upon it now can only repeat it was good thing the best gallop we have had this season to my mind well my dear before we started for the meet said to my husband dear whenever they find at tackley the fox invariably makes as you know for now as want several little things in the town and the doctor tells me must not do too much just now think if you do mind order to take the brougham into get what want and wait for me at the crown can then drive home com capital replied and having given orders accordingly off we started for the meet where the first person we saw with everybody staring at her as usual as if she were wild beast instead of very pretty girl was brown as and had christened her between ourselves well they found almost directly as you know and away we all went habit and self well in the van my dear was on dear old the best horse ever rode and the best declares he ever had in his stable but can assure you the queen of the arena though flatter myself can go bit above the average was in it simply was in it with habit they ran into him in the open at last and was one of the happy few who got to the end but habit got there before me and when came up to me to present me with the brush insisted on his giving it to her instead and what is more rode up and congratulated her could help it really could poor little thing she looked so pleased and made the noble master such pretty little speech that he fell in love with her on the spot so he told me afterwards well my dear my lord got his second horse and away they went to draw for an afternoon fox and along with them whitelegs had had about enough of it however and so had to tell you the truth so as captain ward and his wife were going my way turned my back on the hounds and went along with them dear old looked as he was turning his head to see wistfully after them with those great kind eyes of his as much as to say good bye you fellows do half like leaving you tired as dear old whitelegs we had very pleasant ride to the three of us eating our sandwiches and empty ing our flasks on the way at the crown the wards and parted com pany and having seen whitelegs drink some nice the queen of the arena warm gruel and kissed his dear nose got into the brougham which was ready waiting for me and having got or things wanted in the town started for home well we had just got as far as the crossroads as you know are about two miles out of when looking out of the window who should suddenly see but my little friend miss habit on foot if you please leading her horse which was dead lame and she herself in tears pulled the check string as you may fancy and was out of the brougham like shot much to the coachman astonishment my dear screamed running up to poor little habit what is the matter have you had fall or what no she sobbed it is that but my horse is dead lame and shall miss the train it was then just ten minutes past and dear me do know what shall do for there is not another until seven and that will be too and the poor little woman quite broke down put her head on my shoulder and cried fit to break her heart nice romance weaved for myself can tell you disappointed lover waiting at the station and biting his moustache in bits all manner of things the queen of the arena there my said soothingly never mind you shall catch your train my footman shall lead your poor horse back to and you shall jump into the brougham and whisk you to the station before you know where you are come there not moment to lose if you want to catch the train so jump and before you could say dear had given her poor lame horse into the footman care and charged him to lead it quietly along to the crown he did like the job could see pushed habit into the brougham bade the coachman drive best if had been there he have said drive like the old gentleman the station and away we went best pace the bay as the coachman persists in calling crusader laying himself down to his work in his very best style well now had habit who had by this time by the way wiped away her tears and looked quite bright all to myself pro ceeded to make much of her poor little thing and told her hoped that some day she would come and pay and me visit at the grange to my astonishment she refused point blank firmly indeed that for the moment am bound to confess felt rather hurt the queen of the arena she noticed it and taking my hand in hers and looking pleadingly up in my face said do be angry with me please do but really ca you little know what am or you would never propose such my dear replied quite taken aback what do you mean am quite sure you

am professional singer or musician perhaps worship music though ca play bit or sing either though strum bit sometimes just to amuse myself and squall dtcasionally to please my said habit am none of those dear shaking her head sadly wish then what in the name of fortune are you exclaimed rather impatiently fear for we were not far from the station by this time and was afraid she would get away and me none the wiser you must make heaps of money whatever you thought to ride the horses you she turned round looked me straight in the face and replied the queen of the arena circus rider my name is and they call me the queen of the arena my dear you could have knocked me down with feather as the saying is was so astonished circus rider the queen of the arena gasped out good gracious you do

jumped out of the brougham and was away and into the station before knew she had gone scarcely there said little that my story and now tell me all of you what you think of it think of it exclaimed the why that it as good as any novel ever read better than most in fact and that the sooner the lot of us cut up to town and visit the queen of the arena in her native sawdust the better that what say on the subject haw capital idea observed major twisting his moustachios as he spoke hard frost no hunting no time like the why not make it to morrow major exclaimed his hostess you are positive genius you are indeed had no idea you had it in you why it will be the very thing to morrow being saturday there is an afternoon performance too that why you named that day of course thoughtful man look here then ladies and gentlemen she went on addressing the company generally the queen of the arena with regard to major which by the way beg to second what would propose is this that we all of us run up to town by the eleven train to morrow morning lunch at the or the grand go to the circus and return by the seven train which will land us back again just in time for very late dinner there that the programme if anyone can propose better let him hold up his or her hand as the case may be not single hand being raised the motion was declared duly carried and now said that lady luncheon is ready so come along good people and we drink the queen of the arena very good health and as they marched into luncheon who for some reason or another seemed strangely agitated got hold of and begged her to give him the minutest description possible of her circus riding protégée that lively lady laughingly complied at the same time remarking to with roguish look should uncommonly like to know what you want to know all these par ticulars about girl you never set eyes on before for wait until after luncheon and you shall replied another romance thought the little lady to herself oh this is too charming the queen of the arena chapter iv snow lay deep on the ground the next morning the country generally looking like an enor mous wedding cake as remarked at breakfast wonder now if that an omen thought who had overheard the remark and who superstitious as sailor should be was quite ready to accept the slightest encouragement as regards the matter that affected him so par ticularly as he had promised he had confided his story to little after luncheon the previous day and the result of it was that they had both come to the conclusion that habit was own lost and no other feel as positive about it exclaimed as if knew it for certain what brave girl too ca tell you how long to see the meeting to morrow between you by the way will you promise me thing before we part my dear replied the grateful there nothing in this world would promise you only give it name what is it the gueen of the arena well it is this was the reply of course there will be wedding and that soon am right am not

must have somewhere to go to so let her come to me and be sister to her if she let me promise me repeated looking pleadingly into face gave the required promise with the greatest possible pleasure as may be readily guessed and felt strongly inclined to hug the fair pleader into the bargain bleak and cheerless as the weather was that circumstance did not seem to affect in any way the spirits of the party who nearly filled carriage in the eleven express to that morning the only quiet one among them being edward arden who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to care to join in the chaff and laughter going on around him his lively friends rallied him on his want of spirits at last lady hazarding the opinion that must be in love she little guessed how well she had hit the mark at length after journey which passed the queen of the arena lightning to the rest of the party but seemed an age to the train arrived in and of those convenient vehicles private omnibus being in readiness to meet them the whole party were whisked off at once to the hotel métropole as being the nearest point to the circus for the pur pose of luncheon which necessity like the omni bus had been ordered beforehand by telegraph that cheery meal being disposed of the omnibus was once more put into requisition and away drove the party to smitherini circus what state of mind our friend was in by this time may well be imagined nor was little much better mind you tell me the moment you see her whether it is her she whispered to as she took his arm on alighting at the entrance of the circus wo forget you may depend replied who was quivering with excitement from head to foot the next moment and they were seated in their places and soon afterwards noisy overture having been inflicted upon them by the orchestra the performance began this part of the enter tainment possessed no attraction for of the party and to wit and the marvellous acts of equitation by mademoiselle the jokes rather stale ones by the way the great little the clown and comical antics of some performing mules passed unheeded by them though greatly appreciated by everybody in the house including their own party and now what is it causes little heart to throb with excitement and to turn pale and bite his lips glance at the programme will explain the performing mules have all but concluded their act and the next item is thus announced miss the queen of the arena on her renowned thoroughbred horse the red will appear in her daring hunting act as performed before royalty in the course of which she will leap over six barred gates in suc cession feat never before attempted by any equestrienne as the mules at the close of their comic business disappeared wave of joyful anticipation seemed to pass through the vast audience like an electric current which was increased as sundry coated retainers of the establishment appeared in the ring each bearing high white gate these being duly placed in position the band struck up the old hunting tune hi chevy and every eye in the place was at once turned towards the principal entrance another second and great cry went forth of here she comes and amidst tremendous clapping of hands and waving of handkerchiefs young girl attired in the queen of the arena perfectly fitting brown habit and mounted on magnificent horse cantered becomingly into the ring gracefully bowing right and left to the repeated plaudits as she halted in the centre of the arena it her it exclaimed in whisper to knew it and oh so glad was the reply meanwhile be good boy and moderate your transports dear said she laying her hand on the impatient lover arm for had risen from his seat with the evident intention of rushing off wait quietly until she has finished her performance and then we frame an excuse and go to the dear girl at once if she was to catch sight of you now recollect it might upset her and spoil everything give her bad fall possibly of course what an ass was not to think of that replied thank you again for your good advice you wonderful person declare you right about everything bravo habit exclaimed delightedly clapping her hands as the queen of the arena and her black horse came to the end of their exhibition and pray where are you and off to rose may ask the queen of the arena she in the same breath addressing her little friend who with had now risen from their seats only going outside for breath of fresh air dear replied that lady unblushingly we be back almost directly in another second they were in the lobby and inquiring of an official the way to the stables crown judiciously administered procured that worthy personal guidance to the spot few minutes later signor he spoke remarkably good cockney english for foreigner was considerably astonished when chancing to go in quest of his leading star to say word to her on business before she took her departure he found her reclining in dead faint in the arms of good looking gentleman the while lady of aristocratic appearance and attired as he afterwards observed in the height of fashion was endeavouring to bring her to with the aid of an elaborately chased bottle great was that gentleman chagrin on learning the true state of the case for well he knew departure from his circus meant large falling off in his receipts you allow her to give one farewell perform ance sir said he obsequiously to when having partially recovered the queen of the arena had retired to her dressing room with certainly not replied decisively not extremely sorry but it is quite out of the question do assure you any loss you may incur by miss leaving you so abruptly her friends will only be too pleased to make good and that is all that can say well that said the crest fallen manager as it happens her agreement expires this day week so she is free from that day your coming here to day sir was most unfortu nate thing for me as it turns out for was just the queen of the arena coming to ask her to step round to my room to talk over fresh engagement and sign if possible for another six months at an increased salary when you arrive and spoil all well it ca be helped sighed poor we always been the best of friends as think she tell you and whilst sorry for my own sake to lose her glad for her own that she as may say going to better her self no offence sir trust in making that hobservation not bit replied heartily and held out his hand which the signor fer vour three months afterwards little had her wish carried out to the letter for and edward arden were married from her house fine may morning and an uncommonly smart wedding it was too and very looking couple so everybody agreed were the bride and bridegroom there was guest of the male sex who quite took the shine out of the others and excited great admiration amongst the rustic onlookers by the splendour of his apparel the name of this heavy swell was signor who had received special invitation under own hand to her wedding his circus still flourishes but the signor has repeatedly been heard to say that since her seces the queen of the arena sion from the horse riding business he has never succeeded in finding star who attracted the public like the queen of the tul èn harles began my wife one night soon after we had retired to rest this really must not go on any longer if your uncle continues to lead the dreadful life he is leading he will get rid of all his money and then what will be come of us should like to know you must put stop to it at once insist upon it do tell me you do know how that is all stuff and non sense as you very well know should like to know who is to do it if you do have you no regard for your children because if you have not have if you have no intention to interfere or are afraid pray say so at once and will write uncle mamma and she will go and see our family lawyer dear old and he shall get your horrid disreputable old uncle locked up in lunatic asylum and kept there now do you intend to see about it answer me at once insist you have no right to treat me like this sir and wo stand it any longer oh yes you need not snore and make pretence to be asleep because know per fectly well you are not now during this delightful curtain lecture ad ministered by my loving spouse had not really been to sleep or anything like it though as she justly remarked had pretended to be by puttinguncle ben in judicious snore occasionally on the contrary as it happened was quite as wide awake as she was and oddly enough actually turning over in my mind the very subject on which she was so eloquent all of sudden only was not going to be such fool as to tell her so oh dear no not been married all these years not to be fully alive to the fact that once you let the wife of your chest imagine that she is cleverer than you are it is all up with your authority over her no the great thing you may depend is to make your wife think that yours is the master mind not hers that it is you that she is to look to for advice in everything to get her out of scrapes maybe that she is the inferior animal allround in fact well may as well say at once my wife was quite right my uncle was going on for an old in as eccentric not to say disreputable manner as it was possible to conceive during my aunt eliza lifetime nothing could have been more decorous than my uncle behaviour breakfast at nine to the city as regular as clockwork home again at russell square at half past dinner at family prayers at bed immediately after now and then this regular life was broken into by little mild dissipation such as dinner uncle or visit to the theatre but these were very rare occasions my aunt eliza not encouraging the drama it having tendency in her opinion to corrupt morals generally she was in conse quence extremely difficult to please and she must beforehand be thoroughly convinced that the piece to be performed was absolutely sans raproche before she could be induced to go my uncle would very much have liked to have gone occasionally to the gaiety and would hint as much sometimes on which occasions my aunt would put her foot down as she called it at once where there are she would say in that awful voice of hers virtuous shudder at the same moment running through her frame do go and then with snap you ought to be aware of that by this time should have thought occasionally she would add by way of solace if you must go somewhere there is that delightful entertainment of and german at george hall or there is know very charming concert at james hall to either of which should be pleased to accompany you at which concession on his wife part poor would give vent to groan he like everyone else was great admirer of the clever entertainers in question and was fond of music of lighter sort but he would have preferred legs if he had had his own way in the matter not having blessed my uncle and aunt with family it was an understood thing that my uncle money would eventually come to me and mine my uncle had stood god father to my eldest boy my aunt ditto to of our girls this was rather bore for of course we had to christen the children after them and if there are names hate and detest more than any others they are and naturally therefore the future was looked into by my wife and myself through glasses of the rosiest possible hue when my aunt died many were the conjectures on my wife part as to what my uncle would now do with himself would he live in solitude and save up his money for us ha ha and eventually pine away and die or would he as have known some dejected mortals do before now when his period of mourning was over launch out into life of fun and frolic proceed to go it in short as that popular comedian would say we were not long left in suspense for the space of twelve months uncle behaved himself with the utmost decorum and went to church more frequently than ever he in short deported himself generally in way that excited the admiration of everybody with whom he uncle into contact including numerous single ladies every of whom would have been only too happy to have filled the place so lately vacated by my aunt eliza and then grieve to have to record casting aside his grief and his sombre garments at and the same time emerged from his solitude and at once proceeded to go it in most alarming fashion by jove he did go it can tell you there was no sort of amusement really believe that that wicked old man did not have shy at and my wife and fairly trembled for the future the first thing the dear old gentleman did was to sell his share of the business in wood street to his partner for goodly sum with no chick nor child who have got to work for now she is gone he said to me when having told me of what he had done observed that in my opinion he had made mistake did not like to say so but had it on the tip of my tongue to exclaim you have got me and mine sir me your nephew with children each more hungry than the other and prob ably more coming who can tell the accounts we heard of doings from time to time were positively heartrending big dinners at and at which the company were not all gentlemen constant attendant at and down conspicuous first nighter at the theatres and regular frequenter of the halls his name associated heaven only knows with what truth with that of miss of the hilar ity and finally this was the last straw making quite name for himself as prominent patron of the amongst the members of which profession he was familiarly known as oh it was enough to make his venerable father the founder of the famous house of browser and turn in his grave with horror it was indeed as for us living as we did in quiet village in the heart of the country do you think we were ever honoured with visit from our uncle relative now oh dear no in aunt time the pair of them were only too delighted to stay with us for bit but things were all altered now we were far too slow for such go ahead young fellow as our sexagenarian relative do fancy the old boy did himself much harm racing for think he went to meeting entirely for the fun of the thing but his sudden and unaccountable penchant dor prize fighting confess did not like at all indeed was warned that he was not only squandering large sums of money upon it but was likely to get rid of good deal more before he had done unless stop was put to it my friend regular man about town and on whose word could rely wrote me as follows if this jolly old uncle of yours only confined himself to visiting the fighting cribs and looking on at the sparring it would be all right but content with that he must needs like friend get hold of pugilist all to himself whom he has taken under his special wing as it were and goes about with on all occasions this fellow dreadful ruffian named alias the sticks to him like leech and no doubt bleeds him in proportion know for fact that he gets large sums of money out of him on pretence of having rescued him from imaginary robbers and such like dodges here is an example your uncle walking home to his rooms in john street after festive evening somewhere or another is suddenlypounced upon by couple of fellows who emerge from dark corner and demand his money with all sorts of menaces threatening him unless he stumps up with all manner of violence they are just pro ceeding to extremities of them indeed by way of bringing the old gentleman up has just given him preliminary tap on the head when there suddenly arrives upon the scene the brave who hitting out or pretending to left quickly puts uncle assailants to flight and escorts him home in safety needless to say the latter is uncommonly grateful vows that the has saved his life and gives him cheque proportionate to his services take my advice old fellow wound up my friend get the old idiot out of this as soon uncle possible or else this gang who have got hold of him will pluck him until he has got feather left to fly with heard do know how true it is that few nights ago they got him on to blind hookey and had out of him before you could say knife if can assist in any way pray command me yours truly this letter of to use slang expression made me sit up bit and was turning it over in my mind in bed and thinking what was to be done at the same moment that my would be clever wife bless her heart doing her level best to make night hideous with her curtain lecture thing was certain something must be done and that quickly to choke off this mad hobby of his once and for all and am glad to say that before went to sleep that night had devised scheme for my uncle benefit which if properly carried out would in all probability thoroughly effect its purpose accordingly immediately after breakfast the following morning shut myself into the apart ment the servants call master study and which usually term the smoking room and lighting large cigar instead of my usual pipe sat down and concocted with considerable care the following letter uncle woodleigh november my dear we are so very quiet down here as rule that under ordinary circumstances should hardly have dared to invite you to pay us visit however venture with some confidence to do so now having great notion that shall be in position to afford you some amusement you are know and am proud to know staunch patron of in my humble opinion that manliest of all our english sports and pastimes the noble art of self what can be finer sight or more calculated to fill the bosom of an englishman with pride than that of stalwart specimens of the anglo saxon race each striving for supremacy within the arena in other words ring amidst the plaudits of perhaps of their countrymen think can hear you exclaiming as you peruse this what indeed think it is the duty of every right thinking englishman to encourage and foster the noble art in every possible way for there is no doubt that proficiency in the use of nature weapons in plain english to be able to use one dukes well great way towards doing away with the cowardly use of the knife and such like murderous weapons so much in vogue in other countries with this object in view few friends and myself have arranged little match between novices from this neighbourhood for purse uncle subscribed for amongst ourselves the combatants have been in training for the last six weeks and as both are good men and thoroughly game we may anticipate with confidence the merriest of of my reasons nay the principal in inviting you to come and witness the contest is that we are much in want of some sportsman of unimpeachable integrity who is thoroughly conversent with the to officiate as referee make no excuse for asking you to take this perhaps unenviable office on your shoulders in the full knowledge that can think of no one so capable as yourself to undertake the duty if can induce you to consent and indeed all concerned shall be deeply grateful need scarcely impress upon you the absolute necessity for keeping the little affair as dark as possible as if it was to get wind not only would there be danger of police interference and they are excessively zealous in these parts but it would certainly cause the rough element to put in an appearance in large numbers at the ring an event which am sure you will agree would be decidedly incompatible with our personal comfort may ask you therefore as particular favour not to mention the affair to living soul above all to any professional pugilist no matter how great your faith in him the projected fight is bar accidents appointeduncle ben to come off next thursday week that ever is we having fixed upon splendid piece of ground on slopperton common some few miles from here any day you like to come will suit me can only add the sooner the better with best love from my wife and the children believe me my dear your very affectionate plausible and having popped this precious mass of lies into its envelope gummed it down and stamped it went out to find my wife and report pro gress and shortly after sat down to luncheon feeling that had done very good morning work by return of post came reply thus it ran john street berkeley square november nth my dear expect me on monday evening next by the express from town would have come before dear boy but for the fact that have little dinner on on the sunday few theatrical folk do you know you old rascal thought would miss the mill for any amount of money for though have itnclf witnessed many turn with the gloves never yet seen the real thing shall have very much pleasure in officiating as referee for though say it that do know where you find better fitted for the post than myself am quite with you also as to keeping the affair dark darker if possible eh and am concerned it is case of the and no mistake love to and the dear children and believe me your affectionate certain pugilist rough but honest creature who looks after me whenever go the rounds is very anxious to know where am off to told him was going to auncle ben funeral and asked him if he would like to come too oddly enough he declined ha ha hurrah exclaimed addressing my wife and throwing the letter over for her to read that all right the old reprobate coming off my love to make all the necessary arrangements ha fight so you wo see me again until dinner time in all probability tell me what you going to do dear wo you pleaded my wife as prepared to leave the room all right my charmer you shall know when the time comes replied gaily how inquisitive the women are to be sure arrived on the monday and the fight and nothing but the fight was the theme of our conversation during the time that inter vened you never saw an elderly sportsman so keen he talked bless you of cross counters smashers on the point of the jaw and other pugilistic terms as if to the manner born on the eve of the great event we were to have dinner party composed entirely of men my wife spending the evening at the so as not to be in the way at two in the morning my uncle and were uncle start in the dogcart for my friend five miles off where we were to breakfast and from thence walk to the scene of the encounter which was close by what dinner it was and you should have heard proposing with many hiccups the toast of the noble art of self defence then proposed his health as the guest of the evening in rising to respond to which the jolly old gentleman tumbled under the table and was promptly conveyed to bed at proceeded to rouse my uncle from his slumbers no easy task can assure you at last with the aid of bottle of soda water got him to understand that it was time for start and he proceeded to struggle into his clothes asleep we hoisted him into the dogcart and away we drove into the darkness such morning as it was raw and cold and drizzling rain falling at last we pulled up at and very acceptable was his comfortable dining room with its blazing fire after our cold drive can tell you to none more so than my uncle who stood blinking and winking like an owl his teeth chattering with the cold like pair of castanets twos and threes the other conspirators arrived and shortly after in came the servants with soups savoury grills and devils and all manner of good things to enable us to face elements pop went the champagne corks and clatter clatter went the knives and forks early rising evidently agreed with us my uncle too who by this time had just got over the effects of the wine at dinner pegged away as heartily as any of us he was evidently popular character for every soul in the room kept asking him to take wine with them my host at last with wink at me suggested tnat if we had all done we had better be off and behold though my uncle is on his legs hurrah speech he could allow us to hiccup he said without giving ush hie toast the noble art of shelf defensh hiccup prize fighting was glorious institooshun and should be who wash that hie laughed hic cup suddenly exclaimed my uncle looking fiercely round the delinquent was young who was leaning back in his chair in fits of laughter my uncle fixing him with glaring eye stag gered round the table and aiming blow at now helpless with laughter lost his balance and fell upsetting his opponent in so doing chair and all well uncle said cheerily as entered my relative bedroom by his request at noon the following day and how are you capital fight was it uncle pities though was it not that poor chap was so hurt they say he will die that the worst of it however we must hope for the best the worst of it is went on quite regardless of my uncle horrified the worst of it is that if anything does happen they be down upon you for being referee it was pity too you were so dreadfully abusive to the chief constable when he turned up lord how aston ished he looked when you threatened to land him on the kissing trap and if that was enough you spoil his boko for him he so proud of his nose too good god exclaimed my wretched uncle sitting bolt upright in bed his eyes nearly start ing out of his head with excitement and fear combined am gone mad for do remember single thing about it ca call to mind single circumstance in connection with the fight give you my sacred word ca my dear boy send for the doctor at once for must be going mad feel am and my wretched uncle sank back on his pillow quite exhausted and rushed hastily from the room to give way to my own emotion oh the sight of his face shall ever forget it the doctor to whom you may be sure impar ted the secret arrived in due course and having adminisftred soothing draught his patient soon himself again and two days after was well enough to return to town am pleased to be able to state that my ruse was completely successful for the result of it was that my uncle acquired thorough dislike to pugilism he severed his acquaintance with much to that per son disgust and bade good bye to the prize ring and all in connection with it for evermore is still under the firm impression that he actually attended the fight was sup posed to get up for him and if you ask him will give you most graphic account of it he invariably winds up his story thus and can tell you what sir was very nearly getting into serious scrape over that little affair being caught by the police acting as referee was bad enough but when losing my temper was fool enough to threaten to land the chief con stable of the county one on the it became beyond joke what new way to pay old debts the damsel delight and the chaperone fear he is voted trump amongst men his father allows him year and he lay you ddy low his tian name was but every body called him doddy lieu tenant in the hussars besides being voted by common consent the best looking and best dressed youngster in the regiment was far and away the fastest and most extravagant man in it and seeing that the gallant corps in question was by no manner of means the slowest in the service that meant good deal you may depend how on earth he managed to do all he did new way to pay old debts the small allowance his father made him some three hundred year was perfect enigma to everybody who knew him there were several wealthy men in the regiment perfect in comparison to yet he not only managed to keep pace with them all but rode and drove better horses kept smarter servants and betted more heavily than any one of them the question one and all asked was how does he do it he himself when questioned on the subject would reply in his usual airy frolicsome manner that having long been convinced that the one great secret of success in this world was never to part he had determined to follow it out most religiously for instance said he when confounded dun gets me into corner cher know promise him windsor castle but never part by any chance why bless your innocent hearts should be stone bwoke in week if played that sort of silly game waiter get me bwandy and soda well maxim as laid down by himself went on successfully for while but the worm will turn and in like manner in process of time poor long suffering creditors began to think amongst themselves that the capting promises were like piecrust made to be broken new way to pay old debts and as consequence began to make themselves extremely unpleasant in many ways to that light hearted sabreur to make things worse the regiment was under orders for and this circumstance naturally made those gentry more pressing in their attentions than ever not that was in the least put out what idiots they are he would say as he lit cigar with peremptory epistle from some long suffering tradesman they ought to know by this time that they can not get blood out of but they will keep on bothering just the the same hang actually got letter from yesterday telling me had over drawn always thought bankers liked to overdraw the correct thing to do in short told when wrote to put things straight notion of putting things straight at his bankers turned out to be sending them cheque on themselves well the upshot of it all was that the colonel was so pestered by his extravagant subaltern creditors that at last he could stand it no longer but sent for and told that young gentle man plainly that if he wanted to remain in the regiment he must settle his debts before they left for gravely assured his new way to pay old debts that this should be done without fail and bowing left the room the day before the ship sailed for with an extra large cigar what he was pleased to call his mouth brandy and soda in glass the size of aa new way to pay old debts stable bucket at his elbow and bran new cheque book of gigantic dimensions in front of him sat himself down at his table for the express purpose of keeping faith with his colonel and settling up with his credi tors there were exactly of them little and big and to each of these did send cheque on his bankers for the amount owing there exclaimed he with an air of satisfac tion as he gummed down the last envelope of the batch that welief to my mind getting wid of all those wapacious wascals after all he added philosophically the colonel was quite wight it was the only thing to do for the future said grandly addressing circle of admiring friends shall go on the operwative pwinciple and pay weady money for everwything oh yes you fellows may laugh but it comes much cheaper in the end fancy well the wegiment as called it ar rived in due course in and shortly after his arrival our friend received the expected letters of acknowledgment from the creditors to each of whom he had so generously forwarded cheque curiously enough they none of them contained receipt and and all were written as nearly new way to pay old debts as possible in the same words the following being specimen new bond street august dear sir we are in receipt of your letter of the enclosing cheque for account rendered on examination of the same however we find that you have accidentally omitted your signa ture we herewith therefore return the draft in question in order that you may rectify the omission apologising for thus troubling you we beg to remain dear sir your obedient servants creale binman to lieutenant brownlow hussars and when who was lying comfortably on his back in his bungalow with large manilla cigar in his mouth and glass of brandy pawnee by his side had read them all one after another he collected all of them into bundle presented them to the solemn looking indian who wasa new way to pay old debts working the punkah and who received them with salaam and grin as if he quite entered into the spirit of the thing and then and not till then he threw his curly head back and roared with laughter the black sheep of the jxe filacli of tljc jfamiln chapter dear exclaimed the elder miss coe as her sister entered the break fast parlour of their little house at dullchester one fine summer morning my dear who do you think have just received letter from indeed really can not guess replied rather frostily for in the first place she did not feel particularly well on that identical morning and in the second if there was thing in this world miss detested more than another it was being asked to guess anything in the shape of the black sheep it was remarkable fact that whenever miss felt perfectly well in herself and in con sequence bright and cheerful and in love with all the world it invariably happened that her sister would feel exactly the contrary and vice versa there was no doubt about it that on this identical morning miss georgiana felt extremely cross and pettish as the old saying is she had got out of bed the wrong way the more crusty and disagreeable she was the more sprightly and amiable was her sister quite skittish in fact the sight of her quite aggravated but to return to miss and her letter knew that you would never guess said she in triumphant tone of voice the same triumphant tone that she always assumed when she had just made an extraordinary never was such woman for making bargains as miss or found something detri mental to the character of someone belonging to her own sex to whom she had taken dislike in the latter case she was positively appalling in her hour of victory the look of withering scorn that would come over her face when she mentioned the name of the object of her abhor rence the cavalry trumpet like tone with which she would exclaim told you so or now appeal to everybody did not say so all along were not to be forgotten in hurry by theof the family spectator knew she repeated that you would never guess oh dear me snapped her sister with stamp of her foot who is it from why on earth ca you say at once instead of beating about the bush so my dear replied miss inherplacidest consequently her most aggravating manner why so touchy of course will tell you you have given me time yet the black sheep stuff and nonsense murmured her sister would have told you am sure at first but that wanted to give you pleasant little surprise the letter continued in an injured tone of voice is from our dear brother fancy that he writes in the most affectionate loving manner the dear fellow says that his health is vastly improved for his trip to the riviera in the spring that since then the hard work he has been doing has rather thrown him back and his doctor in con sequence has expressly ordered him to give himself rest for while and to go right away from the noise and turmoil of town and do nothing in the country for while he writes thus said miss adjusting her pince nez and reading when it came my dear sister to answering the important question of where shall go to it struck me that could not do better than write and ask you and dear to give me shelter for whilejunder your roof the quiet peaceful life know you lead at will be the very thing for me shall be enabled to forget my briefs for while and consequently get rid of the brain fag which is now telling upon me brain fag exclaimed her sister parentheti cally what terrible word of the family complete repose is what want the doctor says and that know shall get with you best love to and yourself and believe me your affectionate brother it has just struck me that about this period of the year you and generally go away to the seaside should this be the case just now pray do not put off any arrangements you may have made on my account with my books and your piano for company still keep up my music find it such solace at times can make myself quite cosy and comfortable in your absence never fear that is if you are not afraid of leaving your house in the charge of such careless rascal as myself by the way at the request of several friends of mine at the bar went through the ordeal the other day of being photographed in my wig and gown and now send the result one for you and for there said miss folding the missive up with much complacency if that is charming letter do know what is people were fond of calling poor from his earliest childhood the black sheep of the and possibly he may at one period of his the black sheep have deserved it it is easy to discern however by the tone of his letter that our dear brother has altogether altered his mode of living is quite changed man in fact feel convinced of it most young men grow fine crop of wild oats in the earlier years of their life and the of whom is evidently in process of time sow them others of course do not his photographs alone do look at them would tell people what he is what good expression he has what firmness about the mouth what eloquence in the eyes can fancy exclaimed in of her bursts of enthusiasm the most hardened criminal that ever existed quailing in the dock when our brother rises in his place in his wig and gown to address the jury and now said she as she sat down at the end of the table and proceeded to pour out the tea the next thing to do of course is to write and tell dear to come at once it is unfor tunate most unfortunate that we are engaged to go to the thursday but do see very well either how we can get off how ever said she brightening up if he comes to morrow we shall have him with us for week clear and we must hope that

hour or so for his disposal know in the after noon before he goes to the station brother of the misses jellicoe late mother filled the important post of county treasurer and fancy was thereby in his

call he smokes think have heard him say so he and will no doubt get on com fortably together do you think so observed with con temptuous sort of sniff as she seated herself at the table have my doubts about that sister for as you ought to know by this the black sheep jack and his uncle never could agree and never will in all probability and as for poor his views on things in general would naturally be so totally at variance with that in my opinion it would really be the height of absurdity to try and bring them together well well replied her sister resignedly then there is nothing for it suppose but for to amuse himself as best he can until we return from our visit to the anyhow she continued as she gathered up her letters and things and rose from the table will send dear ack telegram at once and say how delighted we shall be to see him as soon as ever he likes to come suppose you have nothing to say against that said miss by way of parting shot as she prepared to leave the room oh dear no

bers in pump court in the temple he tore open and perused telegram just put into his hands by the sharp sparrow whom it pleased him to speak of in conversation as my clerk pretty conceit of his seeing that the business of the said clerk consisted in the main in blacking his master boots brushing his clothes waiting at table say ing at home or not at home as the case might be to the numerous visitors to his chambers both male and female and keeping at bay the duns who were apt at times to be more pressing in their attentions than was compatible with personal comfort his master was immensely proud of spadger as he called him he can make champagne cup as well as can myself and will look you straight in the face and tell lie better than any boy in and the black sheep higher praise can give him than that should like to know he would ask his friends the telegram that had just opened and perused with so much satisfaction proved to be from his sister miss at chester with whom the reader has already become acquainted and ran thus delighted to see you come to night if pos sible as we are on the point of going away for fortnight on visit spadger shouted yessir replied that

like sack wery good sir replied the boy seizing the telegram and running downstairs steps at time whistling loudly as he went he returned in an incredibly short space of time and was much gratified at his master in forming him that he had decided on taking him with him some doubts having arisen in that gentleman mind as to whether his boots would be properly blacked at his establishment and he was as was wo nt to say hawful pertickler about his boots and said mind you do get cheeking the other servants or getting drunk or anything of that sort you little devil you or you get the sack and in double quick time too my sisters where we are going wo stand any of that sort of nonsense can tell you wery good sir replied putting on most innocent expression and retiring with the the black sheep breakfast things to the solitude of the pantry where he proceeded to relieve his feelings by indulging in sundry pantomimic gestures expres sive of much inward satisfaction six that evening saw master and man safely landed on the platform at dullchester and as there was plenty of time before dinner the black sheep of the family decided to walk to sending on in advance in fly with the luggage and pray who may you be you lazy littleof the family monkey inquired still in rather captious mood addressing and eyeing that unabashed youth with much distrust as he stood in an easy attitude with his hands in his trouser pockets and straw in his mouth looking on in the most unconcerned manner whilst the maidservant and the flyman between them lugged his master luggage into the house who am mum replied swelling with indignation at being so addressed why mister confidenshul walet to be sure confidenshul muttered the boy to himself with chuckle should rayther think was confi denshul indeed why do know wot the would do without me blessed if do the black sheep chapter iii lizabeth said miss addressing her elder sister as they were leaving the fast room one morning within day or of the termination of their visit to their friends the at honeywood hall must have word with you at once in private let us seek the privacy of the garden have begun in sepulchral tone of voice as soon as they had reached the shrubbery this morning received of the most shocking the most letters it is possible to conceive thanks to we shall never be able to show our face at again that is very certain warned you you will recollect at the time but you would insist on asking him down and we must now take the consequences of our folly he was reformed character you said reformed he is indeed good heavens me exclaimed poor miss declare you have made me all of tremble what on earth is the matter do for sake tell me at once of the family oh wish had my smelling bottle with me feel sure you are going to tell me something to upset me oh my poor nerves ca stand it really ca must go back to the house at once stuff and nonsense said unfeelingly insist on your staying whilst read these dreadful letters one is from the other from ahem will read first now listen to this monday dear georgiana when ventured to sug gest short time ago that in asking that respectable brother of yours to come and stay at you were making very great mis take was as good as told by your sister in that polite manner she always puts on to me to mind my own business consequently prefer to write to you and leave you to judge when you have read my letter whether my advice to you with regard to your brother was good or whether it was not he had long ago given up all his old pursuits such as racing gambling etc you assured me and was now reading steadily for the bar as regards the first can only reply has he and as to his going to the bar should say the only bar at which he is ever likely to take prominent position is an hotel the black sheep or more probable still if he goes on much longer as he is now doing the bar at the old bailey this is very certain he has made name for himself with vengeance during his stay in our ancient city such trifles as poking fun at the and playing disgraceful practical joke on poor old of the best known and most respected men in the place were bad enough but when it came to his being the prime mover in bringing down horde of murdering ruffians from for the express purpose of indulging in the brutal amusement of prize fighting there is nothing more to be said the only excuse for him that can find is that as your sister is so fond of saying is jellicoe every inch of him for once she is absolutely correct he has succeeded to perfection in the no doubt to congenial task of keeping up the family reputa tion and adding fresh lustre to its long roll shall say great deeds the fight duly came off on and most disgraceful scene it seems to have been of the combatants whose principal backer by the way was your delightful brother being all but killed the police appeared just in time to save the poor wretch life and not quite in time to arrestof the family who disappeared at once and has not been seen since the unfortunate prize fighter is at this moment in from whence he will be removed to gaol where in all probability your brother will be keeping him company before long warrant having been issued for his appre hension together with the other principals who ever they are sincerely hope they will all be caught and justice meted out to them with unsparing hand need scarcely tell you that this disgraceful conduct on the part of your brother has to certain extent affected your own good name in dullchester you ca touch pitch without being defiled you know some malicious per sons have even spread about report that you and went away for while pur posely in order to give your brother freer play to bring off his brutal prize fight this of course has made me very angry as doubt it will you and strongly advise you therefore to return at once so that you can personally con tradict the canard all right minded people of course know per fectly well that you are both quite innocent in the matter indeed have heard the strongest possible expressions of sympathy from nearly everyone of your acquaintance you would have had mine as well the black sheep ordinary circumstances but seeing that warned you all along what the consequences would prob ably be if you ever let your scamp of brother again inside your house confess am not sorry for you one bit your aunt sends her love with mine remain your affectionate there said when the letter came to an end what do you think of that hope you are proud of your favourite to think that we have lived all these years at dullchester respected believe by everyone with whom we came into contact and then to have our good name trampled in the mud by our own brother oh it is too disgraceful it was all your doing whimpered for as says in his letter he warned you all along and so did you can not deny it you know you can not and now she continued perhaps you would like to hear what dear has to say bother exclaimed miss stamping her foot ca bear the man both he and hate and detest poor and believe they have pur posely exaggerated the whole affair has got no earthly business to meddle with ourof the family affairs and consider it exceedingly impertinent of him to write to you at all as shall tell him to his face the very first time see him am quite ready to go back to as soon as ever you please the sooner the better indeed and arrived there shall make point of showing myself in public as much as possible jellicoe afraid of the opinion of such people as who never as you know has good word to say for anyone and hoity toity what next indeed and the indignant miss having thus spoken her mind turned on her heel and with contemptuous toss of her head walked off to the house leaving her sister speechless with horror and amazement bravo miss say we the following letter from to his friend and brother bencher written just about this period will possibly explain what actually took place better than any words of ours king bench walk july dear promised to give you an account of my doings at dullchester so here goes have just got back from that slowest of towns and as you prophesied before you the black sheep away have succeeded in making the place too hot to hold me any longer what my sisters will say to it all when they come back do know bless their old hearts the first thing did to distinguish myself was week after my arrival in the place winning fifty pounds from an old ass named great man in the club here and much respected as they say it was the talk the town can tell you my boy old must tell you fancies himself at billiards most tremendously thinks himself second really believe the stupid old fool when gave him out of and beat his head off the very first day was put down for the club the old gent conceived violent dislike to yours truly from that moment and lost no opportunity of abusing me like pickpocket behind my back of course our quarrel was great source of amuse ment to the members of the club generally it does take much to amuse people in place like as you may imagine and there was always kind friend ready to repeat to me the things the old idiot was good enough to say of me do you know that fellow jellicoe temporaryof the family member friend of timmins inquired little the most mischievous little beggar in the club one day in the most innocent manner in the world know him sir certainly not roared know him he snorted why would be seen going to bull bait with him much less know him now this remark rather nettled me and determined if possible to have my revenge and that quickly accordingly that night thought the matter out carefully and over quiet cigar when reached home arranged my plan of action for the morrow before went to bed had got it all worked out as pat as possible the following afternoon after lunch down marched to the club as usual and having first of all taken into my confidence entered the billiard room prepared to do battle with mine enemy there he was as usual as large as life and on extra good terms with himself for he had just succeeded in taking the whole pool said in my cheeriest manner growled he in response have game at billiards went on in casual sort of way taking up cue as spoke and begin ning to knock the balls about give you the black sheep out of and play you for pony

especially when he knows have money depending on the event come now say you do as wish do nothing of the kind sir roared the old fellow rising from his seat like an angry turkey cock if you choose to make foolish bets you must take the you really wo said the family no wo sir yes you said quietly be if do he shouted amidst roars of laughter all round the room pretending to be much disappointed left the room on pretence of going to write letter now came part in the pro gramme no sooner was out of the room than he began at the old gentleman afresh awfully obliged to you said he you put tenner in my pocket that have growled the old gentleman who detested because he was always poking fun at him do make too sure of that not certain that do as requested me if only out of regard for his sisters

see heverythink as old would so saying joined me in the writing room and having carefully shut the door we both in dulged in an immoderate fit of laughter by and by went back to the billiard room where was immediately tackled by now all smiles for the old humbug was in blue funk lest should cry off and thereby prevent his landing good thing there was nothing he liked so much as betting on nearly certainty we both knew he was always indeed making bets well thought out before entering the club house you may depend good afternoon said he when we parted company sharp mind and we spend pleasant morning amongst the lions eh ha the family and away he went chuckling to himself all down the high street you should just have seen his face and his start of horror when trippit calling him out the next morning he saw me waiting for him outside in the garb of chimney sweep brushes and all it an imposition and fraud he shouted appeal to the members of the club but the said members could speak for laughing and he could get no satisfaction from any of them he was mean old rascal too and had won money from them so often that they the black sheep delighted at seeing him caught in the trap the more he gesticulated the more they laughed at last goaded to desperation he declared his intention of winning his bet at all hazards come on sir said he to me come on and actually taking my arm in the excitement of the moment away we went with crowd after you should have seen us striding along the high street people running out of the shops to look at us where do you want to go to first sir gasped poor old the said choking with laughter come on sir come on this way sir we turned into the close and was just wondering what the vergers and people would think of us when my guide suddenly stopped short good heavens he gasped out it the and sure enough not hundred yards off was to be seen the portly figure of the approach ing with measured tread reading book as he walked along poor old waited for no more but casting at me an indescribable glare ca call it look of hatred that shall not forget if live to be and muttering the black sheep benediction let go my arm and ran away as fast as ever his legs would carry him much to the astonishment of his reverence the who stood staring in amazement wondering as well he might what on earth it all meant as for me made the best of my way home to change my unsavoury garments after which repaired to the club and made of particularly festive luncheon party assembled together to celebrate the event our victim sent cheque to in the course of the afternoon which cheque we carefully divided saw no more during my stay in it was reported indeed that he had taken to his bed so disgusted was he with the whole proceeding of course the little affair was very quickly all over the town and under the head of practical appeared with sundry additions in the columns of the dampshire chronicle and dullchester advertiser altogether made quite name for myself hardly had the excitement cooled down over this little affair than woke up with another yes dear boy we brought off the mill between and in which you know took such an interest in first rate style picked out the spot for where the fight came off is aboutof the family eight miles from here on the borders of counties as very well knew so that if the bobbies did interfere we had nothing to do but to shift our ground and laugh at we all got into couple of innocent looking furniture vans hired for the occasion and drove to the spot as comfortably as possible won by the skin of his teeth and landed unfortunately he all but settled the and the bobbies coming down in force before we could get the latter away we were obliged to leave him to their tender mercies he is now in the hospital under poleece as your friend whom have left behind me writes me word only hope he wo die meanwhile warrant is out for not only and the seconds but for yours truly as well awkward ai it am in consequence off to to night and there put up at the hôtel de paris which address will find me until writes me word that it is all must tell you is cousin of the of chester wife so if anybody can square the matter he will no more now from yours ever the black sheep the black sheep of the family had indeed managed to keep up the family reputation during his stay in as his sisters found to their sorrow on their return and the expressions of pity they got from the numerous callers at nearly drove poor miss mad and too had managed somehow during their stay to totally demoralise the interior economy of the establishment the good looking parlour maid had during the absence acquired taste for ribbons of fancy character and had become flighty in her demeanour two things that miss could not and would not brook the cook too was discovered in liquor one fine night circumstance that had never happened before when remon strated with by the sisters she burst into tears and producing much crumpled letter from her pocket kissed it with much emotion calling wildly as she did so on her blessed blessed spadger to come to her old enough to be his grandmother too as the now thoroughly disgusted observed as she returned to the drawing room after giving cook month notice the ladies indeed were thoroughly put out with everything and everybody arriving brimful of abuse of was tackled to such tune by the angry miss elizabethof the family that he was forced to retreat in the wildest disorder finally the thinking to take advantage of her brother indiscretions to work on miss feelings and induce her to marry him was sent about his business to use an expression common enough amongst the vulgar with flea in his ear it will be long time we fear before the black sheep of the family and his familiar spirit get another invitation to as miss is fond of remarking with sigh dear is such jellicoe you know game to the ta tlje tale of the turf many years past more indeed than care to remember has been my invariable custom as christmas time comes round to pack up my traps and repair to off shire in order to spend the festive season in company with my dear old friend and school fellow and should say no people in this world were ever better suited to spend christmas together than the pair of us to begin with we are both bachelors and so far as know likely to continue so each of us have the same tastes in common with each other to remarkable degree favourite dinner is rumpsteak and oyster sauce with game to the last batter pudding to follow my favourite dinner is rumpsteak and oyster sauce with boiled batter pudding to follow swears by port wine swear by port wine solaces him self after his day work is done with music do the same the only difference in our mode of action being that his instrument is the violin mine the violoncello finally we have both been so to speak com parative failures in the battle of life no it can not be said that either of us have what is called got on in the world though as he says turning sixty is still only the parish doctor at the same age or just about am what have been for the last twenty years viz managing clerk to and the well known solicitors of lincoln inn fields stay when mentioned just now that and were one as to our likes and dislikes was not strictly accurate for in respect our tastes most certainly differ and in this way whereas cockney bred and born pine for green fields and all the delights of rural life who has not been up to times since he walked the hospitals as lad is always talking with sigh of the pleasures of the town nothing pleases him better indeed than to refer back to those halcyon days when he was student at guy though it must be yearsgame to the last since he visited theatre he keeps himself posted through the medium of the newspapers with all the latest information respecting the stage and all pertaining to it and knows far more about it than living on the spot do that is certain it is very funny when you come to think of it we old fellows sitting over our pipes and grog of night each riding our respective hobbies he we say criticising the last new play at the which he has never seen and probably never will enlarging on the superiority of this race horse over that am great upholder of the sport of kings though rarely go to game to the last and never bet or the meets of lord so and so pack of foxhounds verily believe for the moment that we are both under the impression that we are thoroughly well up in all we are talking about knowing penchant for theatrical gossip of all sorts make it my business sometime before starting for my annual christmas visit to my friend to collect all the latest tittle tattle anent the profession expressly for his benefit whilst he like the good fellow he is does the same by me as regards matters connected with sport of any kind in his calling of parish doctor he of course visits the and in that last refuge for the destitute he often am sorry to say comes across some poor broken down old man who at time or another has been shining light in the sporting world and who in all the garrulity of old age is only too delighted to dilate on his former glories whenever he can obtain listener from such as these then my friend culled many and many an old world story and treasured it up in his memory nay sometimes committed it to paper for fear he should forget it until the time came for me to pay him my usual visit which visit he always declares and believe he means it he looks forward to with more pleasure than any other event in the year well one christmas some years ago it was agame to the last rare old fashioned one remember down went as usual to shire and there was only one regret that crossed my mind as looking out of the carriage window whilst the train was in puffed along surveyed the wrapt country which was that unless there was very sudden change of which apparently there was very small prospect should not witness that sight of all others always looked forward to during my stay viz meet of the hounds no the more looked at the weather the less liked it as of my fellow passengers remarked stamping as he did so his benumbed feet on the floor of the carriage as if to give emphasis to his words we are in for and no mis take at all about it no there would be no hunting no coursing no steeple chasing no nothing this time that was tolerably certain so quite disgusted with the prospect from the window lit cigar leaned back in my seat and amused myself with thinking over the stories of life had got together for benefit and wondering whether he would have anything out of the common to tell me as usual when got out of the train at my journey end found waiting for me out side in the gig drawn by the old chestnut horse that knew so well the sight of them both and the greeting game to the last from my old friend was so cheering that positively for the moment quite forgot the cold my luggage including the barrel of oysters without which never started on my christmas holiday being stowed away set the old horse going and away we went into the snow bound country at as good pace as could be expected under the circumstances we had only some three miles to go but the cold was so intense and the road so bad that it was toss up which of the of us was best pleased when we arrived at the doctor door he or the old horse it had been long established agreement between us that anything very special in the story telling line that either of us had to tell was to be kept until christmas night so until that time arrived our conversation of an evening was confined to general topics and the relating to each other of our respective experiences since last we met we will therefore skip over the intervening days and the reader must please to imagine the christmas dinner over the cloth removed the spirit decanters lemons sugar all the materials in fact requisite for brew of hot punch on the table and my host and myself each puffing away at cigar from the depths of couple of cosygame to the last arm chairs in front of blazing fire on the top of which bright copper kettle is singing away merrily for some minutes we both sat smoking in silence and there is no saying how long we might not have gone on doing so had not the kettle evidently highly indignant at our behaviour on such an occasion suddenly boiled over and brought us to our senses now proceeded to brew the punch and when he had finished his congenial task once more sat down remarking as he did so well old boy hope you got good yarn this time for me yes think have replied or if that all and you well only got he rejoined but by jove it can assure you and what is more has the merit of being true at least fancy it has if you are ready to hear it tell it to you now added he and so saying he took pull at his punch settled himself in his chair and began as follows it was just about six months ago as near as can recollect that returning one evening from my usual round tired and dusty and looking forward to quiet evening all alone with my violin found message waiting for me request ing my immediate attendance at woodbine cottage small house on the game to the last some three miles off to see gentleman there who had been taken suddenly and seriously ill so urgent case did it seem according to the messenger that did not even wait to swallow the cup of tea so much needed but turned the old horse round and drove off as fast as could arrived at woodbine cottage was received at the door by lady of middle age and of some what faded and careworn appearance whom recognised as having seen about the lanes when had been driving about and who had been pointed out to me as the new tenant of the cottage maiden lady of the name of beechcroft according to all accounts she was very reserved austere sort of person keeping entirely to herself and not seeing soul from one week end to another nobody in fact seemed to know who she was where she came from or anything at all about her and as there was nothing parti cularly wonderful in lone single woman of mature age settling down in cottage all by herself and as in addition she paid her way and went to church as regularly as clockwork twice of sunday no matter what the weather was the gossips could not if they would find any thing to say against her character so seeing that she was not inclined to be sociable they ceased after while to trouble their heads about her or her affairs later on however visitor arrived at thegame to the last cottage one fine day in the shape of man who it was quickly ascertained was no less person than miss beechcroft brother come to reside with his sister permanently said the neighbours perhaps we shall see something of the interior economy of wood bine cottage but alas they were doomed to disappoint ment for if was re served this brother of hers by name was still more so and ac cording to all accounts morose and surly into the bargain big gaunt man with haggard expression of coun tenance and scowl instead of look or word in exchange for friendly greet ing the good village folk very soon gave it as their opinion that there was mystery attached to him if there was not to hi sister game to the last oh he had rare skeleton in his cupboard according to them can tell you it was to see that had been summoned so hastily to the cottage and after few words in private with the sister accompanied her upstairs to the sick man room quickly saw that it was case of paralysis which might or might not be fatal my patient though man of strong physique had all the appearance of man who had taken every sort of liberty with it not only that could not help thinking as noted the furrowed lines about the face that there was great mental as well as bodily trouble of these enemies is bad enough but when medical man has both to tackle then say he has superlatively difficult task before him his sister answer to my question as to what had been his occupation in life more than con firmed my suspicion her answer was comprised in short and they were uttered with sigh and such sigh the turf asked for no more information for wanted none my sole thought now was how to bring the man back to health if it is only question of bodily ailment may have chance thought as looked at the great game to the last gaunt muscular frame before me but it is the mental mischief was sure there was that am afraid will master me well am only as you know poor parish doctor and had in consequence ample time to devote to this particular case in fact had been millionaire he could not have had more undivided attention than he received from me felt too an interest in my patient apart from professional view and if the truth must be told certain amount of curiosity as to what was troubling his mind for felt sure there was something and was equally certain that his sister was not aware of it whatever it was well we triumphed in the end when say we am not alluding to my poor services alone but to miss tender nursing which no words of mine can sufficiently praise and do really think ever felt more pleasure in my life than when one fine day found myself able to tell my patient devoted sister that her brother at last was not only out of danger but with proper care had every chance of ultimate recovery got stronger every day thanks to his grand constitution but there was still something troubling him could see the very fact of which was quite sufficient in itself to retard my patient progress in his journey towards con valescence game to the last what this was was determined to find out if possible for reasoned that if he could be induced to make clean breast of anything that lay on his conscience to anyone in whom he had trust and confidence it would possibly be the means of relieving his mind to certain extent if he knew his trouble was shared by another person he and were very friendly by this time so fine summer day when his sister had gone for walk broached the subject to him as delicately as could rather to my astonishment he was not in the least angry on the contrary he com plimented me on hitting he called it the real reason for his illness you quite right he said have trouble great trouble for forty years past has this demon been sitting on my shoulders like the old man of the sea and now when with one foot in the grave think of the past and what have done there doctor declare to goodness am the most miserable wretch in existence in existence did say why am not fit to live if you knew all you would spurn me from and my unhappy patient buried his face in his hands and completely broke down come come sooth ingly this wo do you know take glass of port wine and then come out into the garden andgame to the last sit quietly under the cedar yonder and tell me all about this great trouble of yours perhaps may be able to advise you for your good will if can you may he did as bade him swallowed glass of wine and taking my arm we sat ourselves down under the tree as had proposed and he at once commenced his tale forty years ago said there was no better known figure on the turf than mine my father had been game to the last before me and when he died stepped into his shoes with reputation ready made as it were my father though was very different sort to his son his betting though large in its way was on comparatively small scale compared to mine prided myself on my dash and go reckless ness good many people called it and was always ready to lay point more than anybody else and rarely refused bet however big the amount most members of the ring would have been satisfied with the reputation enjoyed viz of being the largest and most dashing bettor of them all but was not so in order to make myself still more famous in the turf world started string of race horses on my own account at first carried all before me and it really looked as if could go wrong it was not for considerable time that experienced anything like reverse when did though it was veritable facev in certain important handicap horses trained in my stable were entered be longing to me the other the property of certain noble lord these short time before the race we tried together with the result that my horse beat the others so decisively that the race in question appeared the greatest certainty out for him we quickly decided therefore that we would at once proceed to back one of the horses belonging to the nobleman just mentioned as blind the public would be sure to rush to getgame to the last on and make him great favourite we should then be enabled to back my horse at long odds at the same time that and my agents were laying against his stable companion as if he was dead what coup it would be to be sure backed my horse to win me an enormous sum and laid against the other to lose fortune right up to the fall of the flag the race was run imagine my rage and consternation when saw my noble confederate horse come clean away from his field and win in canter mine who had beaten him so easily in the trial coming in bad third when thieves fall out know the old saying well that was what happened now and before settling day managed to extract the whole particulars of the robbery from of the small betting fry who had been mixed up in it and who imagining himself badly treated by his principals had promptly rounded on them as it is termed the whole affair can be explained in very few words the trainer and his noble employer when the trial took place had purposely deceived me as to the weights the horses carried and so far from my animal getting the best of it as thought the one who eventually proved the winner had something like stone in hand the best part of ft the outsider wins game to the last that little affair cost me but paid up every shilling on the monday with smiling face pre tending to know nothing about it whilst in my heart vowed revenge how that word rang in my head revenge revenge revenge sleeping and waking thought of nothing else bided my time like cat waiting for mouse and at last it came my noble confederate owned the favourite for the leger yes the corsair had won the guineas and the in canter and no wonder therefore that the stable looked upon the great race at as their own there was man in the ring though who apparently did not think he would win and that individual was myself never ceased laying against the horse and the last bet laid to his owner in person indeed on the saturday before the race was finishing up by taking that he did not get place on the monday morning the racing world experienced such shock as it had not received for very considerable period in the course of the day the news had spread all over the country that the favourite for the had been found dead in his box too everybody game to the last yes the report proved to be perfectly true the corsair was dead and his noble owner irre trievably ruined perfect howl of indignation went up through out the land the jockey club offered reward for the discovery of the poisoner for poisoned the horse was without doubt the government offered another with the result that shortly after professional horse watcher named was arrested on suspicion evidence was very strong against him he had been seen hanging about the yard of the inn at where my lord horses were and the lad in charge of the favourite owned to slipping away for five minutes to buy some butter scotch as he said leaving the other in charge whilst he did the prisoner was committed by the magis trates to take his trial at the assizes the grand jury after reading the evidence returned true bill the judge himself patron of the turf summed up dead against him at the trial and the end of it was that in less than month from the leger day found himself lying under sentence of death in the condemned cell of york castle it was strongly suspected that the culprit had confederates in the crime and who these were some of the more energetic members of the jockey club strained every nerve to find out myselfgame to the last was called before that aristocratic body and made to show my betting book could prove that had backed the horse as well as laid against him so they could make nothing of me meanwhile petitions were got up to the king asking for respite and every induce ment was held out to the culprit himself to make him confess who were his companions in guilt neither were of the slightest avail and who so active as in trying to make poor confess did not go to and visit him every day at the prison and all to no effect the culprit last day upon earth arrived was the first to enter his cell and the last to leave it at night got the credit not only in the prison but out of it of being philanthropist of the genuine type oh if my admirers could have heard poor final whisper to me that night as bade him good bye you sure it be all right master right as the mail whispered back it arrive at the last moment never you fear and then you be free once more and rich man for life think of that and cheer up what would my admirers have said if later on that night they could have overheard con versation between me and the common hangman at the latter lodgings why should have game to the last disguised with false beard and moustache why did count out hundred pounds in gold upon the table reminding him in hoarse whisper as did so to which he nodded an assent of his promise to do the job the second somebody was on the scaffold and even if reprieve did appear at the very last moment the man in the beard inquired it ud be too late if there was on wasgame to the last the other reply as he locked the bag of gold safely away in desk poor suffered the next morning doctor and never to my dying day shall forget the wild look of anguish he cast around before the cap was drawn over his eyes in another second the drop fell with thud and was safe fell down in fit and my so doing gained me greater kudos than ever said gazing into my horror stricken face you know the skeleton in my cupboard now need not tell you it was prompted to do as he did not that the least regret the actual poisoning of the favourite for that was simply case of tit for tat it was who buoyed him up to the very last moment with the hopes of reprieve thereby stopping his mouth for poor was very fond of life and openly declared to me that he would what he called split upon the whole business unless it was made properly clear to him that his neck was safe trust you master trust you the poor fellow would say when for the time had assured him that it was all right somehow wound up though death without confession not only cleared me but actually did me good from social point of view never prospered game to the last eventually had to leave the betting ring altogether or it would have left me luckily for myself in case of accidents had bought sometime before handsome annuity for myself and settled money on my sister here as well so was all right in pecuniary sense but am miserable man and always shall be to the end of my days can you wonder at it doctor replied the bishop of giirb cnt fhmtiitg bishop of nay the celebrated wild horses so useful from time immemorial to writers of fiction shall not drag from me the name of his diocese was of the jolliest old was going to say chaps but that would never do fancy calling bishop chap how about the bishop of bath and wells though one might call him chap bath chap eh no must not be irreverent so try again the bishop of was one of the jolliest fellows no that wo do either there is decided lack of dignity about the word fellow somehow that renders it unfit to apply to bishop must try another the bishop of was one of the jolliest pre lates hurrah got it at last that ever donned pair of lawn sleeves yes though say it that should like that expression very much indeed the word donned too is very nice when the bishop of you come to analyse it there is quite soupçon of and about it there is no doubt about it certain words are strangely applicable to certain people for instance if was writing about house breaker might say was as looking burglar as ever slipped into rascal great coat you will observe how appropriate the words slipped into and rascal are to the profession adorns or again speaking of sportsman one might describe him as as jolly very popular word notice at the present time as ever popped into red coat on hunting morning and so on to return to the bishop of by jove do you know was as near as toucher just then letting out the name of his diocese he really was without exaggeration one of the jolliest and most popular prelates that ever donned lawn sleeves to say nothing of bree oh dear me there am at it again mean and gaiters most jolly people you find are good doers as rule in the eating and drinking line and my bishop was no exception to the rule jolly people too are always stout and prosperous looking your thin whipping post sort of people may be pleasant enough but not jolly never jolly man to be strictly jolly must weigh at leastthe bishop of stone my was all right in that respect also and credit to the episcopal butcher in every way now when man indulges freely night after night in the pleasures of the table takes his share of champagne at dinner and his bottle of claret after dinner to say nothing of little extras such as whitewash in the shape of sundry glass of brown sherry such brown sherry my had really do know its equal anywhere glass of kummel say after the ice pudding and ditto of ancient brandy with his coffee it stands to reason that unless he takes proportionate amount of bodily exercise to balance matters as it were with his internal economy and keep it in good order he is extremely likely more than likely to get that most distressing of all ailments namely the liver complaint of course for an ordinary person of such habit nothing is easier than to keep himself to use slangly but most expressive word fit but odd though it may seem it is next door to an impos sibility for dignitary of the church like my bishop with penchant for good living and knack of laying on flesh to do so if his path lay in another walk of life there are ways by which he could keep his weight down such as hunting shooting bicycling etc but situated as he is not one of these amusements is open to him the bishop of whoever yet saw bishop standing well away from covert with loader behind him knocking over or trying to rocketing pheasants as they skim over his head or blazing away in warm corner until his gun is red hot what respect would his clergy have for him if they were to see their beloved chief skimming over the ground on bicycle at the rate of bishop of miles an hour he is even barred from tennis all this is really very hard in my opinion field mar shal or lord chief justice can do all these things with punity why not bishop well regret to say that pre cisely what have been de scribing as likely to happen to gentleman of full habit if he did not take sufficient bodily exercise befel my own particular bishop of wo say where possessing superlatively good cook not of your second rate french chefs but sympa thetic female woman who had graduated underthe of no less person than the renowned him self and being blessed with an appetite that enabled him at all times breakfast luncheon and to do full justice to the good things she dished up for his benefit it is not surprising that he not only succeeded in laying on large amount of superfluous flesh that he could have done very well without but that in process of time he began to feel what he himself was pleased to term very so so he was wo nt also to feel depressed and low at times especially in the morning so much so that many and many time about twelve he would have given his eyes for that excellent restorative brandy and soda had he been the colonel of crack cavalry regiment he not only could the bishop of would have rang for on the spot but being bishop well he dare and that all about it ja what would have happened to his butler who might have been understudy to the archbishop of canterbury so dignified not to say pompous was he had his master done such thing good ness only knows the long and short of it was this that after suffering in secret for some considerable time he did at last what he should have done at first viz called in the doctor reason must tell you and the principal one that my pet kept his sufferings to himself was that he was mortally afraid of the physicking he would to certainty have received at the hands of his wife regret to say was the very opposite in every possible way to her lord and master say regret because think there is nothing pleasanter than to see jolly man married to jolly wife and oh yes she was an daughter and took care to let you know it can tell you had less jollity in her com the bishop of position than any woman ever yet came across she was tall thin and bony so bony indeed that when in low dress her shoulders looked so square and stiff that they always conveyed the notion to my irreverent self that if they could have spoken they would have said say old boy hang up your hat and coat on us please do her nose too might have almost expressed itself in the same way it was of the shape known as roman and very highly coloured so much so indeed that if did not know for fact that its honourable owner drank habitually nothing but barley water should have given her the credit of being as partial to glass of good wine as her worthy husband people was her special weakness the patent medicine vendors indeed little knew what friend they had in her or they would feel certain have clubbed together for presenting her with the most costly testimonial that ever was seen or heard of it would have been worth their while to have purchased the koh noor for her if it had been in their power she was so impartial too patent medicine man was not favoured bit more than the other to day one was told that cockle were the only things to take to morrow nothing would go down with my lady but the equally renowned anon mother syrup would have turn and so the bishop of eno fruit salt and somebody else py retic saline went up and in down her ladyship estimation like game of battledore and shuttle cock it was quite case between the pair now we go up up up now we go down down down the good bishop was well aware of all this and trembled in his very gaiters when he thought of how his wife would physic him if she only knew how so so he was and said he to himself take very good care she do know accordingly instead of doing like bishops out of would have done remaining in bed and sending post haste to his doctor to come and see him he without saying word to anybody just put on the episcopal hat fine morning after breakfast and assuming his jauntiest air whilst he hummed bar or from the hallelujah chorus for the express benefit of the archbishop of canterbury understudy who condescended to open the front door for him walked off to see his doctor the bishop of chapter ii if the doctor whom our bishop went to consult had been one of the ordinary run of doctors the chances are that after listening with deferential attention to his patient account of himself and his symptoms he would assuming very long face you may be sure have proceeded to frighten his victim out of his wits by the vague hints he threw out casually and then after writing out prescription of fearful import intelligible to no living soul except himself and the chemist ordered him off to or possibly siberia for doctors nowadays are funny fellows and it is hard to say where they wo tell you to go or what to take but not being one of the perpetually washing his hands in invisible soup gentry with an oily tongue and as full of fads as an egg is of meat on the contrary being man of few words and plain of speech as his which was after brief inspection of his patient he summed up the situation in very few words your liver all wrong my lord that the bishop of the matter with you said he you must put the muzzle on and take rrfore exercise else be hanged if you wo be in queer street quite see that answered the bishop but it all very well for you to talk about taking exercise my good friend you do seem to realise that person in my position can not take his recreation like an ordinary mortal what would people say for instance if went shootingthe bishop of or hunting or fenced or boxed or rode about on bicycle ca even play lawn tennis how about riding said the doctor horse exercise would be the finest thing of all for you if you cared for it nothing like it assure you brings into play nearly every muscle in the human body without over tiring used to ride great deal in my salad days when was up at replied the and there is nothing should like better than to have good gallop occasionally if thought people would not say it was infra dig let exclaimed contemp tuously shall send you blue pill to take to night and my advice is or rather my orders are yourself horse as quickly as possible if not sooner and go out for good ride every day of your life believe me it the best cure for dyspepsia out will exclaimed the heartily rising to go and here my hand upon it by the way added he perhaps you would mind letting it be known that you have ordered me horse exercise in case people should talk do you know never fear said the doctor see to that you may depend and off went the bishop to his palace with step so jaunty and so pleased an expression of countenance that everyone he met wondered at the the bishop of arrived at the palace he retired straightway to his study and setting himself down at his writing table indited note to his chaplain requesting his presence at luncheon as he wished to see him on very important business having transacted which little piece of business the good man betook himself to his own particular easy chair and indulged in prolonged and hearty chuckle then the thought suddenly occurred to him how will like my appearing on horse back and he looked quite grave but only momentarily for he reasoned to himself even she ca say anything when the doctor distinctly orders me to ride and once again the episcopal countenance was wreathed in smiles another thought then crossed his mind it is extraordinary what odd things do cross our minds occasionally what if should come across the hounds when am out for ride fine day and what if my horse my naughty wicked horse should take it into his head to run away and join and this jocose idea so tickled the that he leaned back in his chair and laughed till the tears ran down his countenance just then the rumbling of the gong announced that iuncheon was ready so wiping his eyes the bishop wended his way to the dining room wherethe bishop of he found and his chaplain who having received his note had just arrived now the good bishop invariably made hearty meal in the middle of the day and his wife there fore was considerably astonished when she saw her husband refuse the hashed venison dish she knew he was particularly fond of contenting himself with the wing of chicken and slice of tongue and instead of his accustomed claret taking glass of sherry well diluted with seltzer water you seem to have lost your appetite said in her deep voice eyeing her husband severely as she spoke am ill replied her husband in such grave tone of voice that the chaplain and the solemn butler quite started am ill have been to see he says there is only one thing for me good man voice trembled at this point and that is horse exercise taken regularly once day but it is so said to him ca help he replied it is your only chance and if you do take it will not answer for the so see nothing for it my dear said the bishop with sigh of resigna tion but to bow to the inevitable and purchase horse with all possible despatch and with that view said the venerable prelate turning to his chaplain wrote to you to come here to lunch in order that the bishop of might consult together as to how this is to be accomplished could suggest nothing else but that you should take to riding on horseback en quired solemnly othing replied her husband stay though he added am wrong he did say something about my going abroad to think he said for year or so but knowing as did my dear your dread of travelling at once knocked that idea on the head said evidently somewhat mollified journey of that description of course would be as you say quite out of the question at least so far as am concerned and much as dislike the idea of your appearing in public on horseback suppose there is no alternative but for you to obey your doctor and so saying she rose from the table and swept in dignified manner out of the room and now said the taking his reverend chaplain familiarly by the arm let you and go into the library and have talk about things in general and horseflesh in particular the chaplain to the lord of had his admirers and his detractors the former declared that he was all that young english clergyman should be looking well dressed with manner that was taking alike with his equals and his more humblethe bishop of friends where would you find man better qualified than he for the charge of country parish his detractors amongst whom was expressed their opinions freely that in entering the church had sadly mistaken his vocation how could man be good church man who played cricket football and dressed habitually in the unorthodox style adopted by the bishop chaplain they argued remonstrances were of no avail either with him privately or his patron the bishop the former declared that the soft squashy head gear usually sported by the curate of the period would fidget him to death not being used to wearing anything soft on his head and as for an all round dog collar and high waistcoat not if he knew it at any price the younger son of country squire he was naturally conversant with the habits and ways of the rural population the sports of the field in which he so freely indulged when at home naturally throwing him very much amongst them in point of fact during his early boyhood he was uncon sciously educating himself for the post of parish priest his education proper was conducted at eton and oxford at both of which places we are bound to say that he distinguished himself more in the cricket field than at his studies not that he was idle far from it he was too the bishop of conscientious to his father to be that he was simply fair scholar and no more there was no denying his prowess however in the world of sport and as for popularity it would have been hard indeed to have found his equal from among his fellows we have mentioned his partiality for cricket but it was at hunting that during his time at the university he distinguished himself most his father kept horse for him and with this hiring occasionally from and frequent mounts from friends he usually managed to get his four days week all through the season with the lord and the our friend figured in silk too on occasion at aylesbury during his sojourn at the with such marked success indeed that had he chosen to have gone in for steeplechase riding on an extensive scale there is no doubt that his services would have been much in request on his taking holy orders he at once dropped his hunting confining himself to day shooting or fishing now and again it caused deal of heartburning you depend when the day came for to put away for good and all the red coat the leathers and top boots that had so often figured in the front rank in quick thing from or steeple aston the bishop of that cerise and french grey jacket and cap too would sometimes even now take them out of the drawer where they were put away in der and look at them with sigh of regret what pleasant recollections of his salad days did they not recall the bishop of when would he ever feel so proud again as on that never to be forgotten day at aylesbury when he did the veteran steeple chase rider captain on the post by short head feat achieved by nothing but sheer horsemanship so the sporting journals of the day declared yes those gallops between the flags were mense fun and he would uncommonly like to have them all over again the breaking of his leg and rib or included this then is slight sketch of the gentleman whom the good now ushers into his sane the bishop of turn to consult with on the purchase of horse and we think it will be admitted that he could not have made better choice the bishop first act on reaching his sanctum sanctorum was to change his coat for looking sack like garment of black serge his next was to take cigar case from drawer which he first handed to his chaplain and then helped him self from the cigars well under weigh and the smokers settled down in their arm chairs the prelate opened the proceedings as was aware he said had ordered him horse exer cise and needless to say in order to carry out the doctor orders he must purchase horse now want said the bishop leaning forward in his chair and emphasising his words by tap ping his chaplain knee with his want of the best hunters to be had for money and am going to ask you to run up to town and buy for me can you start to night certainly my lord replied the considerably astonished but may ask what you want for surely one would be enough would it not the other one is for you my boy replied the for you and nobody else detest riding by myself and object to groom so intend you to accompany me on all the bishop of and great many pleasant rides we shall have together have no doubt eh you very good sure my lord gasped his breath almost taken away shall be only too pleased of course about the horses he enquired suppose you like them thoroughly quiet and mannered well replied the of course should like as safe conveyance as possible who would but at the same time do at all object to horse with little go about him do run away with the impression that because have never been on the top of horse bless you figured in silk jacket at aylesbury before now as well as your self eh you dog you here the bishop worked his arms as if he was finishing and as for hunting kept horses and hack and hired as well all the time was up somehow had sort of idea all along my lord that you had been sportsman in your youth said his chaplain with grin well you were right returned the bishop and now said he there nothing else to do but to hand you the sinews of war in the shape of blank cheque and then you can be off as soon as you like here it is see there is no occasion to hurry back you want to see thethe bishop of horses jumped no doubt and perhaps get on them yourself and that all takes time oh you want horse that can jump well inquired the chaplain of course do why supposing in one of our rides we should happen by accident of course to come across the hounds and my horse and yours persisted in joining them you would put me on the back of brute that could jump would you what and the bishop apparently much amused at the notion he had conjured up and clapping the who was evidently much amused also heartily on the back pushed him out of the door and bade him start off to with all possible despatch on his horse dealing the bishop of chapter iii few days time the wrote down to his pat ron to say that he had been lucky enough to pick up nags at lord sale brown and bay one at and the other at that he had every reason to believe were perfect treasures he had at the same time taken it upon himself to engage groom expressly to look after them valuable hunters like the pair he had purchased as he justly remarked requiring more skill and attention than serious coachman was likely to bestow upon them he wound up by expressing hope that he had not encroached too heavily on the bishop cheque book and said that he and his new purchases with their attendant groom might be expected on the following day by the train that arrived at at grimes the serious coachman who was highly indignant at being treated in what he considered shabby and underhand manner in other words that he had been done out of his just dues in notthe bishop of being sent to buy the horses instead of the reverend strolled sulkily down to the station pre pared to pick any amount of holes in the new purchases on their arrival to say therefore that he was rather taken aback when he recognised the quality of the horses as they stepped quietly on to the platform from their respective boxes is hardly the word well what do you think of them inquired the chaplain nice enough sir nice enough sir replied the coachman with slight touch of his hat they sound sir they sound he added as much as to say all is not gold that glitters sound exclaimed the with laugh if you as sound you do and that all about it glad of it sir glad of it growled the dis gusted coachman in tone of voice that said plainly doubt it very much all the same great was the sensation as the new groom having got his charges in marching order mounted and leading the other pro ceeded to make the best of his way through the town towards the episcopal stables who who whose be th th they lad inquired stiggles the stuttering saddler rushing out as they passed his shop in the high street the bib bib bishop ejaculated he in the bishop of as answered his query well ham bub bub blowed and forthwith divesting himself of his white apron he scuttled down the street to his house of call the white hart where rushing into the parlour he informed the inmates that he had just seen two belonging to the bib ib ishop pass up the stut ut treet good enough to win the the gugger grand national major the recognised of the place strutting up the high street with his glass stuck in his eye in his usual aggressive manner was the next to take stock of them and bid stand and deliver two minutes afterwards old who did not know horse from cow pulled him up short in like manner tomthe bishop of trim might well begin to wonder when he should get home it is really astonishing what lot of interest people take in their affairs the bishop ok chapter iv bishop new purchases turned out complete success he and his chaplain went out for quiet ride two days after the horses arrived and it was hard to say which of the nags they liked best by previous arrangement the bishop and the until they got clear of the town endeavoured to appear as ignorant of the art of equitation as possible for the benefit of the public at large and it was treat to see the way the good held his reins and his whip and how he stuck his heels up and toes down his chaplain the same anybody looking at the pair of them would have put them down as of the veriest muffs that ever got astride horse not only would have but did for as matter of fact the eccentric horsemanship of the bishop and his companion was the cause of much derisive comment on the part of the bystanders as they rode through the streets if the said bystanders though could have seen the objects of their mirth after the bishop of wards when they reached the downs they would fancy have been rather astonished to say the least of it this is delightful perfectly delightful ex claimed the bishop as he and the after riding the road for some time suddenly found themselves at point where the downs stretched away as far as one could see to the right and the left of them this is delightful repeated he again taking his horse on to the velvet like turf and putting him into canter indeed echoed his chaplain how do you like the bay my lord by this time he the bishop of the nicest horse ever got on action perfection quite perfection ca find fault with him replied the leaning for ward in his saddle and giving the bay hearty slap on the neck an endearment which the animal reciprocated by making playful bite at his lord ship boot wonder which is the fastest of the presently observed the as after canter they drew rein and pulled up into walk once more wonder which is the fastest of the do you know should be almost in clined to back the nag you are on at mile he not so big or powerful quite as the bay but he bit better bred should say and quicker on his legs what do you say fancied his patron horse was the fastest and said so though he added the extra weight the bishop rode stone heavier than he did might tell how would it be he suggested to get on to the grand stand belonging to which now loomed in and have regular trial there nobody about to see us he added coaxingly as he saw the looking round him suspiciously on hearing the proposal really think we might do you know re plied the prelate with smile besides added he his eyes twinkling with merriment the bishop of if anybody did see us it would probably only appear to them as if our horses had got little out of our hands what just so replied the chaplain trying to smother laugh and failing signally in the attempt lead on then said the bishop and let us to business at once so the turned his horse head and followed by his patron con tinued gaily along in the direction of the race course as they neared it he suddenly pulled up quite forgot all about the rails my lord exclaimed he how stupid of to be sure if we want to get into the race course we shall have to jump them here my answer to that quoth the bishop sending his horse without moment hesitation straight at the rails the bay jumped them like bird his jolly rider flourishing his whip hand in the air as they rose he then turned round to watch his chaplain performance which need less to say was equally artistic both as regards horse and man let me see observed the latter looking about him this is the straight run in where we are now so as he spoke to post discernible in the must be where they start for the mile races to this point the pair accordingly made theirthe bishop of way and having arrived there turned their horses round and prepared for the coming struggle there was no delay at the post you may be sure merely off we go from the bishop and away they went the on the brown making strong running the truth being that that noble animal had got trifle out of his rider hand the latter soon pulled him together how ever and when the pair got into the straight for home there was very little to choose between them moment the looked like winning the next his chaplain it was in truth very devil of race and had it taken place in public must have led to anytamount of betting as the bishop of the horses were running the end of it was that my lord won somewhat cleverly though between ourselves we can not help thinking from what has come to our knowledge since that the out of deference to his superior officer did not exert himself quite as much in the final struggle for supremacy as he might have done that may or may not be at all events the bishop showed that with increasing years he had not forgotten how to finish that he was un commonly pleased with his both horse and himself goes without saying and his face was study when turning round to his chaplain as they rode quietly homewards he told him that he felt almost like boy again already as for he could say sufficient in his praise he must really buy the doctor some little present he thought as memento of his extraordinary skill in the treatment of that ailment we are all so subject to viz the liver complaint hooray for good say we the bishop of chapter the expiration of week the in habitants of the old cathedral town had got so used to the daily appear ance on horseback of their reverend with his familiar spirit the in attendance that they scarcely took any notice as the pair jogged along through the streets in all the pride of apparently most indifferent equestrianism so well did they act their respective parts indeed that they even took in lady serious coachman the great who would declare to the hunting groom had brought with him from that it was in his opinion puffect shame to putt such muffs as them alluding to his master and his chaplain on such splendacious however being shrewd fellow had his suspicions and would say nothing in reply the being well aware of all this thought that the time had now arrived when he and his chaplain might with safety make themselves trifle more comfortable not to say sportsmanlike about the legs the bishop of accordingly fine day in lieu of the episcopal gaiters appeared most workmanlike pair of butcher boots the chaplain leaner extremities being adorned in similar fashion the bishop in moment of playfulness had suggested to the that he should mount pair of those extraordinary contrivances known as antigropelos as having more clerical appearance than the or boot but at that notion the chaplain struck at once no no my lord laughed he fair play jewel do you know like master like man so far as regards boots at any rate so you shall returned the jolly prelate clapping his chaplain heartily on the back it was only my fun only wish we could don leathers and tops once more eh my boy well it was funny thing but the very first day this worthy pair put on their new boots the strangest adventure befell them that you ever heard tell of that day was indeed réd letter day in both their calendars and one venture to say that will never be forgotten by either of them they had made an earlier start than usual that morning the horses having been ordered at past ten instead of enough when they got clear of the palace number of other equestrians seemed to have taken it intothe bishop of their heads to choose the same hour for ride in the country dear me exclaimed the bishop where can they all be going to wonder should wonder my lord replied the with sly twinkle in his eye if the hounds the old harkaway hounds think they call them were not meeting somewhere in the neighbourhood and now am positive he added for look my lord there is red coat just ahead of us oh yes there is evidently meet somewhere close by ah well said the bishop we must avoid the meet suppose you do happen to know in which direction the fox is likely to make if they find him do you because if you did we might accidentally meet them do you know if we could do so without danger of heading the fox would be guilty of that great sin for anything said the bishop with shake of his head have hunted in this country since was boy my lord replied the chaplain but think know where to place our selves so that we shall see some of the fun without the trouble of going to the meet just then some mounted men cantered up saluting the bishop as they passed who in his turn inquired where the hounds met at colonel blazer the bishop of they told him the colonel was going to entertain his friends at breakfast they added so that there would be very large meet they expected it sure find too either in long wood or the osier bed chimed in another sportsman so we pretty certain to have good gallop if the fox makes for remarked third sportsman ah well wish you good sport said the bishop as they once more saluted his lordship and trotted on their way and now come along my lord exclaimed the as they came to place where roads met we branch off here if you please and make for point of vantage know of from whence fancy we shall be able to see all that is going on jogging on gently for couple of miles or so the at last came to full stop am rather in doubt said he and should like to ask question before we go any further wonder if there is anybody about chop chop chop went the billhook of farm labourer who was mending the hedge overhanging the road little higher up and whom he had not perceived until now which is the way to peartree farm my man said he riding up and feeling in his pocket for sixpence the bishop of ye mean replied the man after hearty stare yes replied the at venture that be it over theer said the rustic pointing straight across the road but you ca git to it until you git into the lunnon road about arf mile furder on and then tis the fust on yer left well but if it only just beyond that spinney yonder said his questioner surely we can reach it nearer than that ca we get through that gate and follow the path and then through the wood the bishop op the gate be locked was the reply and you ca take it off the hinges neither said the chaplain that nuisance ah well thank you all the same and here trifle for you at the same time handing the man as he spoke the sixpence he had got ready for him thankee kindly said the man resuming his work as if nothing had happened nuisance not being able to get through the gate observed the it is said the bishop but stay my young friend he exclaimed here is stile at the side surely we can manage that between us oh certainly replied his chaplain mutter ing to himself what an old gamecock it is to be sure should have proposed it only did not know if you liked that sort of fence shall give you lead my lord do replied his lordship the chaplain accordingly took his horse back pace or and sent him at the stile alas blackbird flying suddenly out of the hedge startled the horse and made him refuse before he could right him again the had trotted his horse up to it and had hopped over it like bird the chaplain horse then followed suit the next gate they found open and then enter ing the spinney beyond they finally found them selves close to peartree farm past this theythe bishop of rode and keeping along the field road they finally drew up on an eminence overlooking the river slush which ran parallel with them fields off beyond that again being succession of vast pastures finally terminating in long range of wood there said the as he pulled up his horse and pointing with his whip to the distant wood that is where expect they will draw first at least they always used to and if they find in the osier bed and the fox crosses the river we shall nick in with them beautifully thought heard the horn so did said the bishop cocking his head on side to listen the more readily they both listened most attentively for some minutes the horses as if quite entering into the spirit of the thing keeping as still as mice not sound was to be heard but an occasional champ of their bits suddenly the chaplain broke the silence with that holloa for pony by jingo so it is exclaimed the waxing as unclerical in his language in the excite ment of the moment as his subordinate yes and bydhe lord there the fox said the in great state of excite ment see my lord yonder he goes just beyond those cows that shepherd dog has gone at him and turned him from his point the bishop of he cross the river lower down as sure as gun if he does the field will have to come right back here for there is no ford for miles down that way and they all be clean out of it unless they swim it there go the hounds too my word how they running come along my lord we will get forward and we shall not only nick in with them but shall have all to our selves it strikes me by jove what lark muttered the chaplain to himself as he set his horse going best pace would have missed this for bishopric and away he and the bishop galloped and pulling up under tree some fields off had the satisfaction of seeing the fox cross the river just below them not until they had seen him well away did they move on to await the arrival of the hounds yow yow yow on they came so close to gether that sheet would have covered them splash they go into the river over the water to my lord says the chaplain with grin not soul was with them but one of the whips and youthful swells in scarlet evidently riding against each other splash goes the whip horse as he lands right into the middle of the river he then begins to swim like duck and in another minute they scramble up the other side and away again the horse of of the youthful swells stopsthe bishop of short sending his rider over his head into the water whilst he himself gallops off in an opposite direction the other refuses altogether and find ing it is no use trying to make him face the water his rider at last cropping him heartily turns him round and gallops off after the rest of the field in search of friendly ford meanwhile the hounds are running hard and people with them these com prising the lord of his chaplain the first whip who rides along with his tongue in his cheek and butcher boy on pony with basket of meat on his arm intended for the early dinner of the household of peartree farm the butcher boy and his pony and his basket the bishop of getting hung up in bullfinch the number is reduced to quite mile behind the master his huntsman and the field come pounding along grinding their teeth and anathematising the fox for having crossed the river just where he did and the river for being in the way at all wondering at the same time who the chaps in black are who have got the hounds all to themselves will they never check yes at last they do at the top of yonder hill and dashed if of the black coats has taken the pack in hand and is making cast on his own account actually aking cast and with good effect too for see the bishop of they hit off the scent and are off again at score the master grins with rage as the black coats and the scarlet top the fence and disappear over the brow of the hill he is so angry that he can scarcely see where he is going and the next minute he is bonneted by bough of tree as he rises at fence and nearly knocked off his horse never was in such rage at last he and his train band bold reached the brow of the hill over which he had seen his hounds disappear and as they did so an unmistakable who hoop came wafted on the breeze to their angry ears no need for the shepherd in the far corner of the field to shout and point with his finger to the valley below the hounds could be plainly seen baying round figure in scarlet whilst men in black were on foot by their horses it was an unmistakable kill in the open never was so done in my life muttered the master sending his horse along down the steep hill at pace that was perfectly appalling and by bishop too he exclaimed in astonish ment as he galloped furiously up to the pack well am and they said he could ride too you seem to have had good thing my lord said he as the bishop approached him most enjoyable canter indeed sir replied the the in rage the bishop of canter thought the baronet that good one wonder what he calls gallop when my chaplain whom by the way let me introduce to you the when my chaplain and started for our little ride this morning we little thought that we should meet the hounds and that our horses would insist positively insist sir much against our will of course on joining them but so it turned out however as all well that ends and we have been lucky enough to ride the run without accident we must not complain complain exclaimed sir should think not indeed forty five minutes over the grass as hard as ever you could go with the hounds all to yourselves and kill in the open to wind up with is not thing to complain about do think only wish had been in your shoes know by the way sir continued sir turning suddenly round to the may ask are you any relation to my old friend of hawley grange only younger brother sir replied smiling give me your hand delighted believe me to make your acquaintance and on such an occasion said sir now in the best of tempers and shaking him warmly by the hand the bishop of nope he added this wo be the last time sh all see you out with my hounds by good many and now my lord said the turning again to the bishop trust you will allow me to present you with the brush as memento of to day sport and allow me to add that if ever man fairly earned it you have this day and taking that proud trophy from his hunts man who had now approached he handed it politely to the bishop who in turn was profuse in his thanks at this juncture voice was heard demanding silence it was that of old the sporting farmer of the par excellence he had hunted he said man and boy getting on for sixty years and during that time he had met all sorts of people in the field but never no never until to day had he come across bishop and says roared that bishop what can stick close to the hounds for and forty minutes the same as my lord here has done this day is bishop as his dio ms should be proud on so calls upon you all wound up at the top of his voice to give cheers for my lord of and cheers were accordingly given with the utmost enthusiasm by the assembled company am afraid this will be the talk of the town said the bishop to his chaplain with shake of his head as they mounted their horses and turned their the bishop of heads towards home having declined sir invitation to come and see him find another fox am afraid so too replied his chaplain and they were right their adventure certainly was the talk of the town for many day afterwards was furious and said that if it was true which she did believe that the horses ran away with her husband and his preciotis chap lain as she called the charles all she had to say was that they ought to be taken out and shot on the spot as for good when he heard of it he sat down in his arm chair and roared with laughter in spite of the hard words said about his last performance by and her friends we fully expect to hear before long of the good and his chaplain going out hunting again by accident of course arrowsmith bristol library fcap stiff covers cloth

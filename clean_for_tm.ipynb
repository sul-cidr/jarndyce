the family game to the last the bishop of the white pat don know why sure but should no more have dreamt of buying such an article as white hat than flying over the moon if it had not been for her when say her allude to the fair but fickle julia but when one night at her father house she informed me in that imperious sort of manner of hers that it was her express desire that should appear at good wood whither was to have the honour of ac companying her the following week with covering in the shape of white hat with black band how could do otherwise than go and pur chase one at once if not sooner the white hat in vain told her that only dark people am fair looked well under white hat she replied flippantly that in hey opinion such hat would suit my carroty hair and little nosetoat besides she added it will remind me of that darling little inkpot dear cousin charlie gave me on my she alluded to vulgar little article price about possibly not so white hat of the shape you see on head with an inkpot fitted inside dear cousin charlie too the man above all others detested my to her was handsome bracelet and she scarcely said thank you for it trust julia said addressing her in my gravest manner you don mean to compare me to an common inkpot why not you silly little man laughed my frivolous fiancée an inkpot in my opinion is very useful article and in this case ornamental so you ought to take it as compliment there was of course nothing more to be done except to obey orders and accordingly the next morning directly had swallowed my breakfast hied me to celebrated emporium for gentlemen situated in regent street want hat said addressing smart shopman who came forward on my entrance into the white hat certainly sir what description of at may ask replied he washing his hands with invisible soap while he waited my answer white hat with black told him by all means said he with alacrity if you will excuse me will first just study your features for half minute so that we shall get at the most suitable shape of at for your with that he fell back several paces and throw ing himself into contemplative attitude his chin supported by his hand gazed at me most intently with one eye shut for fully two minutes felt myself getting quite hot and uncomfortable under the operation said he at the end of the inspection should like for the governor to have look at you sir if you have no objection you see sir he went on apologetically in our establish ment we don go on the principle of ordinary atters who say to themselves an ead an ead and an at an on the contrary we look at our customers eads with the heyes of artist for hinstance where flat or at suits one gent down to the ground it might look orrible on so saying he tripped gaily off to return imme diately with stout party all smiles and bows whom rightly guessed to be the governor as he called him he immediately proceeded to go through the same pantomime as his man thf white hat ing several steps he folded his arms and cocking his head as far on one side as ever his short neck would allow contracted his bushy eyebrows and stared fixedly at me for fully couple of minutes his man and he conversing in whispers all the time you re wrong johnson you are indeed said he after pause raising his voice for my benefit neither viscount lumbago nor lord rumbelow shapes would at all harmonise with this gentleman intellectual countenance the earl of skeffington continued he with shrug of the shoulders might have done had there been leetle more hair on the face as it is see nothing for it but the duke of shire own particular yes sir said the master of the shop addressing me this time after careful study of your features sir feel convinced that the only hat for you is one of the exact pattern as that worn by our kind patron his grace the duke of downshire the same firm yet mobile expression about the mouth the same lofty forehead and expressive eye johnson reach me down if you please his grace block and measure this gentleman at once for hat the exact pattern of the duke the exact pattern you measured was accordingly and think sir said the swell hatter as he bowed me out of the shop the result will be satisfactory to all parties the white hat gave sigh of relief when got into the street for had never seen such fuss made about hat before in my life it was gratifying though very when came to think of it to be accused of bearing strong resemblance to real live duke found myself thinking as walked along whether by an chance one of the duke of downshire family might not have married into mine at some distant period if could only speak familiarly in the course of conversation of my cousins the downshires or mention casually downshire goes to newmarket next week and fancy though am not quite sure mind that the duchess accompanies julia would never dare to treat one of the proud downshire breed in the frivolous flippant manner it is now her pleasure to assume to me on all occasions well this important business having been con cluded wended my way to julia father house with view to luncheon julia was alone in the when got there and at once told her of my purchase she was condescending enough to say that it was very sweet of me not to forget her com mands hope though she added you bought one hat is too dreadful to contemplate have ordered one replied proudly thethe duke of white hat exact counterpart of his grace the duke of downshire julia burst into shriek of laughter what she screamed did you buy an old hat of the duke for pattern or did you ask his man for it do tell me entirely fail to see the joke replied with some instability of manner as matter of fact went by chance to the duke hatter and he told me that possessed similar features to his grace and oh don cried julia it is too bad to make me laugh so much it makes one fat they say but can help it the idea of your fancying you are the least like the duke of shire you poor little thing what wretch that hatter must be why the duke is but julia couldn go any further sinking back on the sofa she buried her face in her handker chief and laughed until she cried attempted to speak but she waved her hand imploringly at last irritated beyond measure fled abruptly from the room muttering maledic tions on the duke of downshire and the white hat as went two days later the the hat came home it was not of course to be publicly uncovered to the world until goodwood but could not resist taking it out of its bandbox and trying it on to see how it looked don you the white hat was greatly pleased with the effect the swell hatter was correct my head in that hat had distinct ducal appearance called my two sisters to share my triumph they are friends of julia and nearly as frivolous as she is which is saying good deal one short glance at me was quite sufficient for each flopped into chair clapped their hands and screamed with laughter oh the women must all be going mad thought made so bold as to inquire the cause of their hilarity oh george exclaimed fanny my eldest sister if you only had your face blacked and banjo in your hand you look exactly like that we used to call massa johnson we saw on the sands at ramsgate last wouldn he mary and she burst into verse of it is the lubly gal love and laughed louder than ever and oh george said mary my other sister wiping her eyes you do look such snob such an arry my dear boy how could you buy such dreadful thing named massa johnson snob and an arry fellow nice people to be compared to certainly in vain mentioned incidentally that the duke of downshire wore similar hat to white hat dukes they said of course could afford to wear what they that was all the comfort could get from them they retired from the room and heard them giggling and laughing for at least half an hour afterwards in their own room ah wait until you get new frock apiece my dears said to myself and if don pick hole or two in it my name isn what it is two days later took my departure for sea to join my julia her sisters and father who had preceded me some days and were all located at the queen hotel in that place as drove up in cab about five clock in the afternoon the steps of the hotel were covered with visitors including my fiancée and her family amongst whom noticed as the reporters say the detested cousin charlie out jumped and the hotel porters at once proceeded to shoulder my luggage and take it to my room be very careful of that bandbox it contained the white hat said to one of them it won bear knocking all right sir replied he ll take it up with that he took it in both hands and holding it at arm in front of him in gingerly fashion as if there was cobra or some equally dangerous reptile inside he ran up the hotel steps the white hat remember upset some salt that morning at breakfast and omitted to throw some over my left shoulder and that is the only way can account for that porter suddenly falling down as if he was shot at the second step he was heavy man and he fell with all his weight plump on to the bandbox what the bandbox looked like afterwards the reader can readily imagine for moment couldn articulate for anger and it was not until the porter had risen and addressed me that found words all right sir said he as he rubbed the dust off himself not much hurt and only knocked my helber bit not much hurt indeed roared out in my wrath you stupid idiot shouldn have cared if you had broken your confounded neck open the box directly and see for yourself the damage you have done the obese porter did as he was bid and opened the bandbox and as thought there was the facsimile of the duke of downshire favourite chapeau flattened out into the shape of gibus the porter putting his hand inside essayed to straighten it out as he termed it and succeeded in converting it into very good likeness of concertina never shall forget the shout of laughter that arose from the party on the steps as the brute held my poor hat up for general inspection as the white hat were julia and the hated cousin charlie laughing the loudest of all could stand it no longer snatching the damaged hat from out of the porter hand threw it from me into the middle of the street giving the astonished porter at the same time shove that once more sent him to mother his back this time waited for no more but rushed frantically off to the sea to the neither knew nor cared aimlessly wandered hither and thither and it was not until nearly eight clock that spirited and weary slunk back to the hotel but little more remains to be told cousin charlie accompanied us to goodwood each day arrayed in faultless grey suit irreproach able boots and gloves and last but not least white hat with black band sported one had bought in the town that very morning and which being considerably too small for me not only kept me incessantly em ployed in trying to keep it on but raised beauti ful scarlet rim all round my forehead and endowed me with headache into the bargain julia after examining it scornfully said that it was the vulgarist looking hat she had ever seen and she must really decline walking with me she therefore hung on to cousin charlie like leech during the whole four days racing white hat leaning could not but observe with very un necessary heaviness on his ignored me altogether it is all off between us now and dear cousin charlie hang him reigns in my stead have hated the sight of white hat ever since the vicissitudes of hack related by himself üirissituùcs it fjiiuïu related by himself as should like to am describe myself in terms than hack common hack you must not run away though with the idea that was never capable of better things than trotting along hard road oh dear no in my salad days bless you could gallop and jump with the best of indeed than most you may take my word for it that if the galloway racing that is so fashionable just now had been in vogue when was young one could have shown some of them clean pair of heels both over country and on the flat not quite very nearly racing too small for hunter hands my height is made my entrée into society as boy hunter the first time was ever put up to auction this was how was described in the catalogue lot swell years old bay gelding an extraordinary fencer very fast possessing exceedingly afraid the vicissitudes of hack manly manners and sound in every respect would make an admirable boy and the local george robins was quite right should have made an admirable boy hunter very nice one indeed should really but for the unfortunate fact that there never was boy born of woman yet that could hold me the moment the hounds found up went my heels and if that wasn good enough took the bit between my teeth and bolted they nearly always came off at the first fence and ha finished the run in comfort by myself what the good of being called the swell thought to myself if one can have one own way in this world oh most gentlemanly ideas had can assure you there must have been somethe vicissitudes ok hack fashionable blood knocking about in my small body feel certain suppose during the period that posed as boy hunter visited more hunting countries than any horse of my size in england you see it was this way would be sold we ll say to go into shropshire to carry some young gent to hounds well what happened why the very first day we went out together off came the young least it was not my fault if he didn sometimes was given another trial sometimes not husbands you can kick off times day have noticed their womenkind don mind bit how stupid of you is what they generally say when dear charles or dear tom as the case may be comes home covered with bruises expecting little sym pathy what good so sympathy if fair creature should happen by chance to be made widow what of it change is always agreeable and the dress is extremely becoming golden hair and widow weeds what can look more charming so though it is quite in the natural order of things that the aforesaid charles or tom may tumble about all day if he pleases it does not at all follow that the cherished son and heir should be allowed to do the same so it came to pass that when had carefully disposed of some fond mother darling by either kicking him off or the vicissitudes of hack ning him up against tree or something pleasant of that sort it seldom happened that the treasure was allowed to get upon my back again was dubbed nasty vicious brute and packed off to the nearest dealer at once and the dealer not being born yesterday as the saying is andtllli vicissitudes oí hack knowing perfectly well that there was no earthly chance of selling me in his own my perform anees being too well send me straight away to brother dealer in distant count there probably to repeat the performance in this way made acquaintance with half the hunting countries in england and by the time was eight years old as you may well imagine there was not fence that you could name from gloucestershire wall to bank in the blackmoor vale that was not thoroughly at home with well this fun couldn go on for ever had managed to kick boy off in pretty nearly every county in england and got such bad name at last amongst the fond mothers that the dealers hated the very sight of me in vain they changed my name to simple simon sobersides and others of like nature calculated to inspire confidence in maternal bosoms one enterprising dealer even christened me the pope and sent me down to neighbourhood teeming with roman catholics but it was no go there was no mistaking the swell and his wicked ways they all said and they wouldn have me at any price the dealer whose property was now thought the best thing he could do would be to break me into harness he just the sort of little oss for some young swell to drive about town in buggy overheard him say to his head man one day think not old boy thought to myself for the vicissitudes of hack hated the very idea of harness and was deter mined to have none of it there was no saying you know what it might lead to eventually butcher cart or something low of that description in all human probability oh dear no it would never do so having de luded the dealer and his man into the belief that rather liked being driven in harness than not that worthy popped me one day into his own private shay as it was usually and taking his missus as he called his wife along with him away we drove to the neighbouring town to do little shopping ha ha what benefit gave them that after noon turned sharp round at everything met in the road occasionally varying the entertainment with shy dealer art was in her mouth the whole of the way she declared and she even wanted to get out and walk but this her husband would not permit declaring as he administered heavy punishment with the whip at each offence that should go better coming back he go bail well we arrived safely in the town and my master having pulled up at the saddler to order something or other was just considering what was the next thing to be done when the noise of brass band in the distance suddenly struck upon my ears crowd was seen approaching it was the troupe of travelling circus doing procession round the town hurrah the very thing ithe vicissitudes of hack stood as quiet as sheep until the first car came close up and then pricking up my ears and giving toss of my head thereby snatching the reins almost out of the dealer hands gave plunge turned sharp round and bolted right across the street bang into confectioner shop bless me what commotion there was dealer was sent flying through the window all amongst the and jellies dealer swore at everything nad everybody the mob whooped and yelled the band played whilst having kicked myself clear of what was left of the which wasn much by the dash for it and galloped straight home as hard as could after this escapade my owner was less anxious to keep me than ever as you may fancy and before very many days were over once more found myself back again at tattersall bless you had been there so often that felt quite at home in the place this time was described altogether differently in the catalogue no longer was the admirable boy hunter of former days but hack with capital action and elegant manners suitable for nobleman to ride in the park or on newmarket heath newmarket ah by jove the very thing exclaimed languid voice behind me on the sun day afternoon before the sale looks sound shouldn wonder if he could jump bit too withthe vicissitudes of hace those tommy what do you say and the speaker slim young fellow dressed in the height of fashion marched up to me and looked me over with critical air the friend he called tommy youth apparently cut out of the very same pattern as himself also came up and punched me about and felt my legs with con fidence unimaginable solomon himself couldn have looked wiser over the operation certainly no veterinary surgeon he was evidently looked up to as an authority for on delivering his opinion which he did with tooth pick in his mouth and his hat tilted well over his nose that looked like goin and just the thing for the cambridgeshire week old chappie his companion at once announced his intention of bidding for me on the morrow jî now gentlemen what shall say for the swell capital action and elegant manners as you can see for yourselves had just kicked man in the stomach and suitable for nobleman to ride in the park or on newmarket thus edmund reading from his catalogue what shall put him in at thirty twenty ten charming hack to all appearance and just the thing for newmarket ten is bid fifteen any advance on thirty going at thirty and down comes tattersall hammer the vicissitudes of hack on to his desk and the youthful swell who looked me over in my stall the day before comes up to the rostrum and gives his name and address my new purchaser found was an under graduate of trinity college cambridge and to that ancient seat of learning was accordingly packed off the following morning on my arrival was marched off straight away to comfortable quarters at livery stable in vicissitudes of hack pany with three hunters and polo pony all the property of my undergraduate master as soon as had had feed of corn proceeded to make friends with neighbour in the next stall brown hunter how long have you been member of the varsity old fellow said in my usual cheery manner popping my head over the partition that separated us which feat could only manage by putting my forefeet on to the manger the brown horse stared at me for second and then burst into loud laugh of course ha ha ha roared he that devilish good pon my soul it is do you know that no tion never struck me member of the varsity ha ha ha very good my new friend having had his laugh out became very communicative with the object of putting me in the way of our undergraduate proprietor he told me was quite the fastest man at cambridge just then and the hardest rider of the whole lot the vicissitudes of hack the beggar never so happy as when he jumping big fence said my new friend can you jump he inquired because if you can he be larking you over all the gates in the neighbour hood before you re much older he don seem able to resist gate and it does jar one legs so coming into road over one said my new ac quaintance with sigh it to be hoped your legs are pretty good he continued for if they re not wouldn give much for em in month we were in the thick of conversation talk of the should walk in but the very man whose virtues we were so busy charles popham or as everybody called him charlie popham accompanied by the same young friend who had looked me over at tattersall well tommy do you like him as well now as you did at tatt other day inquired popham of his companion better if anything was the reply so do went on the other and tell you what we ll do old boy you shall come to lunch with me and then mount you on old brown sugar and get on the swell and we go for lark and see what he made of you shall give me friendly lead eh your man replied tommy who was evidently man of few words emitting as he spoke perfect cloud of smoke from an enormous vicissitudes of hack see what made of indeed thought to myself as the pretty pair took their departure show you what sort of stuff made of before you re many hours older see if don at three clock round they came again up to an alarming extent in riding attire of the most orthodox pattern and decidedly noisy the effect probably of their potations at luncheon my neighbour the friendly brown and myself were then brought out and the two gentlemen at once proceeded to mount my new owner aping the jockey held up foot which the attendant hostler evidently used to his ways at once seized and hoisted him into the saddle as lightly as cork knew at once that had got workman on my back and at the same moment the horrible thought struck me that my running away days were over and when thought of the many pleasant gallops had had in the course of my life with no one on my back it really made me feel quite sad well away we trotted through the town our two riders admiring their legs in the as they passed and quickly got into the country now then tommy said my rider throwing away his weed and settling himself down in his saddle we ll turn in here and then go straight ahead to miles farm pull up there for glass of old sammy beer and then on we go again aps added he young sammy will join the the vicissitudes of hack family party on that young un of his and then we have jolly good and so saying charlie popham bringing me up to gate put the whip in confident manner under the latch in order to open the same with view to entering the field hallo he exclaimed with thought more pleasure than regret in his voice here lark tommy blowed if the gate ain locked what to be done jump it suppose replied the man of few words all serene said my own sporting under graduate with great if he did but know what man he was after my own heart give us friendly lead there good old chap pie old brown sugar generally hits em bit and perhaps he break the top bar and make it bit easier for our friend here me if you please tommy did not trouble to reply but simply put the brown horse at the gate new white one the old horse went at it very lazily and though as his master predicted he hit the top bar very hard the gate was none the worse his rider disgusted at such slovenly perform ance got at brown sugar directly he landed and proceeded to send him along cracker across the plough beyond looking back over his shoulder to see how we got on bless you before he could say jack robinson blowed if the gate ai locked the vicissitudes of hack was over the gate and past him like flash of lightning talk about giving me lead indeed ran clean away with my rider for four fields jumping each fence as if it was house so he told his friend tommy afterwards then the weight began to more especially as two of the fields were plough and began to slacken my pace bit then it was that for the first time in my life found out what the word retribution meant for the moment charles popham felt me cease pulling at him he exclaimed oh no you don you little devil you re not going to bolt one minute and stop the quite come gurr along with you directly so saying he shook the reins and touched me with his spurs and sent me at an awkward stile hundred miles an hour had had quite enough of it can tell you and was never better pleased in my life than when at the end of the next field caught sight of the farmhouse at which my owner and his friend had announced their intention of halting made mental vow never to run away again was in short obliged to recognise the fact that riding undergraduate was very different customer to have on one back from schoolboy home for the holidays whom had no difficulty in parting company with at any moment chose well had great fun during my universitythe vicissitudes of hack career and my only regret was that it did not last longer than it did had not been up quite year however before charlie popham elated at having won lot of money on the cambridge shire celebrated the event to such tune that the college authorities took it upon themselves to decline his further acquaintance his tutor who was very fond of him tried hard to save his scapegrace pupil but the dean some how could not be brought to see any fun in being obliged to vacate together with his belongings his house for fully week in consequence of its having been rendered uninhabitable by shovel well sprinkled with cayenne pepper being introduced into it through window so there was nothing for it but for my young friend to go and go he did to the great regret of his tutor his gyp his bedmaker and numerous cambridge tradesmen he having as they feelingly expressed it spent his money like gentleman during his sojourn in their midst the worst of it was that and the other nags had to go too for though we had not assisted in any of our spirited young proprietor escapades such as the dean house nailing the proctor up in his and so on it was decided by popham guardian that it would be best for his ward to travel for while with view to toning down his too exuberant spirits and as he could hardly take us along with him round the vicissitudes of hack the world the whole lot of us once more put in an appearance in tattersall time as the property of gentleman going abroad felt very sad can tell you when for the last time my dear old friend brown sugar and went over with each other the many pleasant days we had had together the canters over breezy newmarket heath the larks across had my full share of the latter you may depend for knowing what jumper he possessed in me oh could jump can tell you my sporting owner was perpetually making fancy bets and winning them too that he would jump this place or that on my back my legs aren what they were and not so young as was tremble to think what shall come to at last said poor brown sugar mine aren much better and feel very old sometimes groaned in concert there were no two horses in england more unhappy than brown sugar and myself that night do assure you our feelings were not improved you may depend when charlie popham accompanied by his friend tommy came to bid us farewell with all his extravagance and wild ness he was natural young fellow and there was something very like tear in his eye and will swear his voice was bit husky as he caressed me and bade me whilst in my turn rubbed my soft muzzle up against histhe vicissitudes of hack chest and nibbled at the piece of sugar he had brought for me how envied his constant companion joe the terrier the chances are he would not accompany his master abroad but then what good time he would have at the guardian place in the country looked after and petted probably by the ladies of the house and waging war from morning to night with his natural enemies the rats and the rabbits whether it was that my legs were worse than myself was actually aware of or whether it was that showed unmistakable signs of wear and tear goodness only knows but must say was hardly prepared for the remark made by rough sort of fellow when tattersall on my making my appearance at the rostrum politely inquired if anyone would put me in at fifty shillin ose yermean said the brute with loud laugh at his own wit despite his persuasive eloquence the highest bid that the great auctioneer could get for me was twenty pounds my purchaser being dandified looking personage rejoicing in the name of horatio hicks the royal belvedere riding school the vicissitudes of hack so ran his card am inclined to think that icks as the wags of the place persisted in calling one of the most pretentious humbugs that ever was born certainly the greatest man in that line ever came across and such snob my word such snob he lived at the of tubbeville where he kept what he called the royal belvidere riding school fancy man professing to teach the art of horsemanship who could barely sit upon horse without tumbling off impudence however will generally carry man through in pretty nearly every calling and assuredly hicks had an unlimited stock of that commodity believe he had been originally haberdasher assistant at all events people said so and some wag in consequence christened him cash that and ickswerethetwo pretty names he was always called when spoken of in conversation and very appropriate names they were especially the former it was an impressive sight to see the swell got up like in circus titupping along with his pupils the said pupils consisting of ladies young and of certain age and few little boys and girls my miss brown he would say with his most captivating grin showing fine row of false teeth my miss brown dessay you wish me at genevar but you are not andlinglassi the vicissitudes of hack your reins quite as should or my dear miss granville positive you think me dreadful me at genevar in fact must trouble you to carry your left and little and the whip in the right so thanks thanks this one remark daresay you wish me at genevar was the conceited puppy favourite expression it was never out of his mouth indeed where he picked it up goodness knows perhaps he invented it himself as for myself took an inveterate dislike to the fellow and longed for the day when he would venture to get upon my back it was destined to arrive before very long and it was an odd circumstance but true nevertheless that in an indirect manner his first mount on me proved the making of horatio hicks fortune midsummer arrived and all tubbeville was away disporting itself at different resorts of at the seaside others on the continent and so on no one ever dreamed of stopping in tubbeville during the dogdays if they could possibly manage to get away our friend cash forward who always liked to be in the fashion would have gone away too probably to genevar but for the fact that the best paying pupil he possessed certain rich widow named mobbs persisted in staying at tubbeville hot as it was all through the summer season and going out riding every day with dearthe vicissitudes of hack icks as she called him for mobbs was fully as vulgar as the and knocked the letter about quite as much as he did they were indeed pair well every afternoon as regularly as clockwork just in the very hottest part of the day the great hicks would wend his way to the widow home himself on one fiery untamed steed and his man leading another for the riding master was far too great swell to do anything of the sort himself the great man would return from one of these rides in fine state of perspiration vowing that the old woman as he irreverently styled mobbs would shortly be the death of him and wishing her most heartily at genevar it was one hotter day than usual in the month of august men walked about with white um brellas over their heads dogs went along with their tongues out and the very pavement looked so hot that it seemed as if it must blister people feet as they walked along that there

such tailor as you on my back before that is certain and if don get rid of you in the course of the afternoon my name not the swell and you should have seen mobbs and slyboots dressed as the fat old widow was in habit which fitted her without wrinkle she looked like large going out for ride as for her face crimson as it was with the heat it might easily have been mistaken for the rising sun don wonder that poor hicks wished her at vicissitudes op hack well the widow being mounted away we went through the town got into the country and presently arrived on slopperton down and now my dear icks exclaimed the widow would it be if we ad nice canter it ain so now we ve got hup on the ill and feel as if it would do me certainly madam replied the wretched cash forward running down with perspiration ex cuse me daresay you ll wish me at genevar but first of all if you ll allow me ll adjust your abit skirt that it now then your right and anging down little more your left so and off we go and off we did go too to some tune for the moment he touched me with the spur with plunge and kick sent the flying clean over my head nor was that all slyboots inspired by my example proceeded to kick up his heels as well with the result that before you could say knife mobbs was lying on her back on the grass kicking about like lively turtle away slyboots and went careering over the downs like pair of wild things when we had had enough of it we had good browse in little hazel copse we came to and were just thinking of making tracks for home when shepherd sent in search of us caught us unawares and brought us back to our rightful owner and his pupil and the shepherd having held us whilst they each mounted off we went home the vicissitudes of hack there was no doubt what had happened during slyboots and my absence for the riding master had his arm round the waist of his fair charge nearly all the way back to tubbeville and such hugging and kissing and calling each other endearing epithets you never heard the next day it was publicly announced that horatio hicks was engaged to be married to mobbs and great was the excitement in the town can tell you shortly after an advertisement appeared in the local papers setting forth that the royal belvidere riding school with its valuable stud of horses and ponies was to be disposed of by private contract am at this moment wondering what will become of me old cash forward and the fair mobbs are to be married next week they go to genevar to spend the miss brown went to the lífcs roto ir mcnt to tbc pcrbir ho is there who has not heard of brown non pareil sauce nay will go further than that and ask who is there who has not tasted brown nonpareil sauce but there why should ask such an absurd question of course everybody has tasted brown nonpareil is every body who is anybody and knows what what personally am one of those dread ful people who always have an appetite and con sequently when the of the period is set before me want no extra inducement in the way of sauce or pickle to make it go down on the contrary much prefer it without holding that the good meat is rather spoiled than how miss brown went to the derby wise by the but am not everyone and there is no doubt that not only are all sauces much appreciated but that of all the sauces extant brown nonpareil is at the head of the poll at home and abroad you can go any where without meeting with it look upon it indeed as quite an old friend if find myself as occasionally do in strange place where don know soul am sure to run across one ofhow miss brown went to the derby brown familiar pictorial advertisements before have been there ten minutes feel then that am no longer alone is it to be wondered at therefore that when brown the originator of the famous sauce paid the debt of nature he should leave very hand some sum of money behind him he most certainly did and more than that he left an extremely pretty daughter as well after the old man death dora brown went to live with her guardian and uncle sir thomas turtle rich city knight who had married her father sister lady turtle had departed this life some years previously so dora found herself sole châtelaine of the big house in portman square and in short space of time being very and determined young woman the servants and every body about the place including sir thomas himself found that her word was law upon everything sir thomas good man feeling that his ward should have somebody to direct her foot steps in the way they should go provided her with lady dora irreverently termed the poor lady as dora gave her clearly to understand before she had been in the house half an hour that she intended to do always exactly as she liked the two got on admirably together the best of eating and drinking nothing to do and plenty of time to do it in and not least how miss brown went to the derby handsome salary it is not surprising that poor faded miss timmins who had been more or less of drudge in the governess line all her life made mental vow to herself that she would never leave her dear charge until she married and not then if she could help it dora certainly was as wilful young woman as you would find in day march never come across such perwerse gal never would remark her groom when insteadhow miss brown went to the derby of riding in the row like an ordinary young lady of fashion she would take sudden fancy in her head that it was pleasanter far to ride about in country lanes instead of the hot and dusty park accordingly off she would go to harrow or richmond the swell groom sulking behind her and vowing to himself he would give warning directly he got home so low too in her abits he informed the sympathising company in the servants hall blowed if she don stop and talk to every old woman and child as she meets it disgustin that wot call the swell groom was not the only one by any means who found the fair dora perverse old lady cribbage who chaperoned her on all occasions vowed she was the most extraordinary girl quite unlike anybody she had ever met indeed she only hoped and trusted she told sir thomas that dear dora would never finish up by making some dreadful mesalliance in the matrimonial line the fact was that her ladyship who was of the most pronounced type had tried all she knew to secure dora and her three hundred thousand pounds for her beloved but impecunious nephew sir george flashcove but without success the baronet as it happened had not long before had he called with no luck at how miss brown went to the derby another heiress whose name by strange coinci dence happened to be harvey of this he did not know was well aware consequently when the ardent lover threw himself at her feet one fine afternoon and offered her his hand and that he had to offer met him coolly with no thank you sir george if harvey sauce won suit you sure nonpareil won dash it but that the sauciest gal ever met in all my life exclaimed the discomfitedhow miss brown went to the derby baronet as he rushed from the house in great anger he told the story the same night in strict con fidence of course to his dear friend jack tattle and it was as matter of course all over the town the next day indeed it eventually reached the august ears of the great panjandrum himself who loving good joke took an early opportunity of being introduced to the fair heiress dora in fact became all the rage and the num ber of offers she received in her first season was something incredible there was not indeed an impecunious swell in london who did not think it his bounden duty to enter for the nonpareil as they called her and her she got quite tired of refusing them at last with all her little eccentricities dora was as girl as ever lived and she could bear the notion that men should come and propose to her for her mone sake alone as she very well knew was the case oh that was poor woman she often would sajq with sigh to the sympathising miss timmins perhaps then someone would really care for me for never mind my dear would reply that hearted soul kissing her nevermind mr right will come along your waj one of these days you may dora at this would heave deep sigh for there how miss brown went to the derby was one suitor amongst the many she had rejected whom she was not quite certain that she had not made mistake in sending about his business with the rest oh frank she would murmur if could only bring myself to believe that you loved me for myself what happy woman should be but there it is all over between us thing is done and so it is no good thinking about it any in proof of which the pretty violet eyes would fill with tears and she would go to her photograph album and gaze for good many minutes at portrait therein of remarkably handsome young man attired in cavalry uniform well as we have already mentioned miss dora was as creature of impulse as you would find in day march anywhere therefore it will not surprise the reader to hear that strolling out with her little yorkshire terrier snap to do some shopping in regent street or thereabouts on the morning of the derby the arrival of which festive occasion she had for gotten but was now reminded of by the sight of the drags and other vehicles she saw starting for the scene of seemed in what the servants would term one of her sudding fits of perverseness to be seized with violent desire to go too what lark it would be wouldn it snap how miss brown went to the derby dora was just wee bit slangy when excited would you like to go to the derby my dear little doggie said she addressing her diminutive pet snap promptly barked his willingness to join in any fun that was going on and further testified his entire approval of the scheme by dancing round and round his mistress in an excited manner snap settled the question effectually cabman said dora hailing passing hansom want to go to the derby is your horse capable of going as far do you think will my little oss takeyer down to the darby my lady replied cabby with suspicion of scorn in his tone why bless yer art it ud be little oliday for im he hown brother to bosphorus he is you just jump in miss and he rattle yer down to hepsom in less time than any hanimal on the road three pun ten there and back and wot yer likes to give me for myself and better bargain you say you never there was no resisting this and accordingly dora taking snap up in her arms jumped in and having previously called at pastrycook and bought some buns for refreshment in case of hun ger away she bowled in the hansom en route for the downs brother to bosphorus as if anxious to keep up the high character his owner had given him laying himself out in what that worthy was pleased to term how miss brown went to the derby ain he miss said he address ing his fare as he descended from his perch at on the road in order to rinse his horse mouth out and at the same time lay some of the dust that had got down his own throat in the course of the dusty drive from town the paddick or the grand stand miss inquired jehu later on popping his head through his trap door as they neared the top of the hill well hardly know replied dora in some doubt perhaps though you had better stop at the paddock as have no one to go to in the stand what do you think cabman well said that worthy with the air of father of family after moment consideration aps under the succumstances the paddick would be the most respeckable of the two miss you see all the osses and the start as well if you walks down to the little gate at the fur corner and shall be just outside whenever you wants to come very well then replied dora stop outside the paddock perhaps it will be the best place for me as you the succumstances added she laughing accordingly she and snap alighted outside the paddock and requesting the cabman to be in readi ness directly after the derby was over she obtained her ticket and walked in it was lovely day and dora enjoyed the scenehow miss brown went to the derby immensely she had some difficulty in avoiding the many people she knew and that was the only drawback however with the aid of her sunshade she succeeded tolerably well and several of the derby favourites arriving she found her presence more or less ignored so was enabled to her great delight to look about her without so much fear of recognition how miss brown went to the derby presently the jockeys having mounted and gone out on to the course there was general exodus of sportsmen and in few minutes independent dora had the paddock nearly to her self in few minutes back they all galloped making for the gate at the far end that the friendly cabman had recommended her to go to and thither she now turned her footsteps and from it viewed the start with much satisfaction to herself they re off roared the multitude as at the second attempt the horses got away to splendid start and dora turning round ran off as fast as she could scuttle and with her heart beating sixteen to the dozen in the direction of the which she reached just in time to catch glimpse of the finish in another second the derby was thing of the past and the winner followed by the others galloped into the paddock dora in her excitement longed to pat him as he passed her and snap still his mistress arm barked his congratulations as he walked by her en route to weigh in and now exclaimed she it strikes me snap that the sooner we are off the so calling her true to his word was close at hand once more entered the hansom and started for the homeward journey to town dora munching her buns and washing them down with bottle of somewhat the cabman had obtained for her atmiss brown in the how miss brown went to the derbÿ the house where they stopped on the way down felt thoroughly happy she informed snap as she kissed his nose that she had never enjoyed day outing so much in her life therefore it was extremely mean of own brother to bosphorus when they had gone some seven or eight miles on the road to suddenly tumble down as dead as julius cæsar needless to sa it did not take many seconds for crowd of the unwashed to put in their unwelcome appearance who not content with confining their attentions to the defunct must needs proceed to mob the fair occupant of the cab who had jumped out immediately the catastrophe happened the cabman behaved like trump but could do nothing against such overwhelming numbers and poor dora now thoroughly frightened defend ing snap with all her might from the attentions of burly ruffian who was endeavouring with many oaths to snatch him from her arms was just about to scream for help as last resource when suddenly something whistled by her ear and in second down went the on his back in the road having been floored by that would have done credit to sayers delivered by young fellow who now taking dora arm within his made his way through the disappointed mob to the hansom he had evidently just quitted in lesshow miss brown went to the derby time than it takes to write this he had lifted dora in and following himself bade the driver get on quickly and that worthy whipping up his horse away they went amidst storm of jeers and execrations and now said frank frank whom we have already alluded to as being one of dora rejected suitors perhaps you will tell me miss brown how it is find you in this lively position what on earth induced you to come out to epsom all by yourself and miss brown explained as well as she could winding up with little penitence on her own very wonderful thing for her to do the reader may be sure will never do such stupid thing again said she with hysterical little sob after which she was unusually quiet and leaning well back in the corner of the hansom scarcely spoke word until they reached portman square you will come in for few minutes will you not captain forrester said dora as her deliverer assisted her to alight have something added she looking pleadingly up into his face on seeing him hesitate very particular to say must say before we oh certainly if may was the cold rejoinder frank was evidently on his stilts and the two entered the house and ascended to the drawing room how miss brown went to the derby want to ask you favour captain forrester began dora looking straight into frank face and talking very quickly whilst her fingers played nervously with her gloves do you happen to know anyone amongst your friends who is in want of governess or companion good fair little on amiable and ahem not baddooking well no can say do replied frank twiddling his moustache and looking solemn rather out of my line don you know eh miss brown do my best though of course who the lady may ask what exclaimed frank starting up from the sofa as if he was shot you why good gracious me mean miss brown on earth do you mean after being so mad as to go to the derby by yourself are you going to be still more lunaticky and set up as governess with all your vast wealth too oh you can be serious am perfectly serious captain forrester can assure you replied dora with somewhat of of tremble in her voice you talk of my vast wealth would you be surprised to hear that owing to bad investments have lost the whole of my fortune and am at this moment penniless girl entirely dependent on my own exertions and without home unless my unclehow miss brown went to the derby chooses to give me one oh dora you dreadful little storyteller aren you sorry say you re sorry frank for believe you liked me little once pleaded dora holding out her hands sorry exclaimed frank seizing the hands his handsome face radiant with happiness sorry why never was so pleased in my life oh it almost too good to be true dora you refused me in your wealth you won refuse me in your poverty say you won and what was dora reply can frank you all the time the lovers were disturbed some ten minutes later by the sudden entrance into the room of sir thomas turtle why my goodness me dora where on earth have you been all day exclaimed the fussy old alderman here was came away early from the city on purpose to take you to see the pictures he called them picters at the french gallery and on my arrival home you are not to be found anywhere and poor miss timmins in terrible way about you where have you been child where have you been where have been why to the derby to be sure uncle replied dora who had now quite recovered her usual spirits everybody goes to the derby so why not poor me enjoyed myself extremely thank you and got back as you see how miss brown went to the derby quite safely thanks here she looked shyly at frank to captain forrester here by the way uncle she went on laughingly seeing that the old man looked from one to the other in some confusion let me introduce him to you and then you can ask him to dinner if you like and every night after until further notice he you frank my future husband said dora taking the now blushing frank by the hand and leading him forward sir thomas turtle sir thomas future husband little jfnirn hunting story for children chapter ilittlc afairg afirst meet hy where little fairy what has become of little fairy such were the cries that were heard on all sides from both high and low when at the meet of arkwright hounds at rnan pleath on certain decem ber morning the master was seen riding up with out his child com panion at his side he looked graver than usual too it was noticed as he exchanged his hack for his hunter and greeted his friends and the reason quickly went round little fairy was little fairy and then gloom seemed to fall over the whole hunt and really you would have thought that little fairy was the daughter or sister of each individual sportsman there assembled and now who was this little fairy that every body was in such distress about well she was the daughter and only child of the master of the hounds when some three years before the squire as he was always the misfortune to lose his wife on whom he doted he at once concentrated all his affection on his little dora shy reserved man at all times even to his intimates he unbent in the presence of his baby daughter as he never condescended to elsewhere small dora was indeed comfort to him in his affliction the family doctor shrewd old scotchman expressed his opinion indeed very freely that had it not been for the bright little lassie as he called dora and the hounds he would not have given much for the squire reason or his life either and he would add the latter sir would na have bin particle use without the former but the two combined formed you understand most useful useful indeed than all the doctors prescriptions put and we have not the slightest doubt in ourlittle fairy own mind that the worthy medico was perfectly right well time went on and arkwright and his little daughter grew more inseparable than ever and at last came the day in both their calendars you may miss dora was to make her first appearance in the hunting field then it was that old ralph duckworth of the wild farm when he beheld dora cantering up to the meet on her pony arrayed in scarlet and velvet with her golden tresses flying in the breeze declared that if ever he saw fairy out of the pretty dear was that article and as ralph was reckoned an oracle in those parts dora was known hereafter as little even her father adopted the name and what dear little fairy it was how do tom was her greeting always to the huntsman how do dear hounds to the pack she would then kiss her hand to the company generally in response to their salutes like the miniature queen she was and now she was poor little fairy of all the members of arkwright hunt present that day none felt the absence of fairy so much as george clayton dashing young sabreur in her majesty regiment of hussars it was curious the attachment there waslittle fairy going to the fairy between the two notwithstanding their disparity in years for when at home on leave no knight was ever more constant in his attentions to his ladye love than was dear doddy as fairy always called him to his child sweetheart like her other slave her father george never seemed to look upon her in any other light than that of young woman and treated her as such in the gravest possible manner much to the amusement of the lookers on yes doddy was very sad that day you may depend it certainly seemed too as if fairy enforced absence from the meet brought bad luck to the pack for though they drew and drew covert after covert the hounds never found all the morn ing and at two clock arkwright as rule loath to go home announced his intention of doing so and you come with me won you george said he looking wistfully at the young soldier know and there was falter in his voice as he spoke she will like to see of course will was the reply and the pair accordingly rode off the old scotch doctor belore mentioned met them at the door as they rode up to the house an hour afterwards in glad to see ye both and you especially said he glancing significantly at george the little fairy puir little lassie verra verra ill fear the worst he whispered to the hussar touching his arm as he spoke but it joost possible your prisince may work wonders with the little and then they went upstairs of course the servants were all in tears for they had quite made up their minds that miss dora must die silly idjuts observed doctor mackintosh contemptuously as accompanied by ark wright he motioned them to be silent and entered the five minutes afterwards the distracted father looking twenty years older than he had in the morning opened the door noiselessly and beck oned to his friend she asking for you george he whispered how do dear doddy said poor little fairy as george sank on his knees by the bed tiss me doddy ike you to tiss me in your yed toat you know do you ook so pretty in your yed and george clasped the tiny frame in his arms and the child glorious golden hair fell all over his face as he kissed her passionately over and over again the doctor at last touched him on the shoulder and he gently disengaged himself must go now dear fairy whispered he little fairy trying hard to restrain the tears that would somehow come no don do doddy remonstrated the child feel so tired and ike peeping on your yed once more she nestled her head against his breast and appeared to be going to sleep then suddenly she brightened up and held her small finger up in her old imperious way doddy dear she whispered what my darling all be oor little ife some day an dear doddy yes dear little doddy if this had been stage play at this period the organ which of course would have been con veniently situated in the next room would have struck up solemn air calculated to give one the creeps angels voices would have been heard in the distance more angels would be seen hover ing round the ceiling the limelight would have been turned full on the face of the or rather dead child for of course on the stage they are never by any chance allowed to and nothing would be heard but the sobs and sniffs from the dress and upper circles the pit and the gallery the stalls and private boxes never little fairy give way to their either not the correct thing or else they haven got any but this is only commonplace story there fore possibly the reader will not be surprised to hear that thanks to the skill of doctor mackintosh little that the domestics headed by her old nurse one and all agreed amongst themselves that poor miss dora was going ome poor lamb and believe fond as they were of her were rather disappointed that she didn battled successfully with the fever so successfully indeed that she was able to write her dear doddy pretty letter wish ing him and au revoir just before he sailed to join his regiment in fairy chapter ii hen hears sifter in meet of arkwright hounds at man heath the scene is not changed in the least still the same looking old beerhouse kept by one jonathan myler still the same cluster of cottages not forget ting the usual accompaniment of slouching men slatternly women and ragged children who always turn out en masse on these occasions the old white horse is there too dirtier than ever nobody ever yet saw common without dirty old white horse browsing upon it and the usual donkey and the usual ducks and fowls if the scene is not changed though the actors are who for instance is this who rides up all smiles to the meet can this be our old friend arkwright little fairy yes it is none other but how altered he is greyer and stouter than of yore but his face has lost the pained expression it had ten years ago and he looks twice as young in conse quence and who is the lovely girl with the fair hair attired in the brown habit who rides by his side sitting her bay hunter with the ease that none but perfect horsewoman could assume can this be the little girl whom old ralph duckworth of the wild farm years ago chris tened little fairy grown into charming woman she does not say how do dear hounds to the pack as in the old days and she does not kiss her hand as the old original little fairy was wont to in response to the salutations she received as she rode up but it is miss fairy as she is now called for all that and pray who is the man faultlessly attired in pink who accompanies the and his fair daughter and whose bronzed face tells of service under eastern suns surely this is not little fairy devoted slave and admirer george clayton the old original doddy indeed it is though major clayton now if you please and apparently just as much slave us ever judging at least by the way miss ark wright orders him fairy hark at him the sly fellow as he gets off his hack and proceeds to tighten his ladye love girths ere he gets upon his hunter he reminds her that the last time he came to meet at dollman heath they had blank day you were away ill fairy do you remem ber was doddy fancy now your recollect ing all that ten years ago too why should have thought you had forgotten it long forgotten it indeed you little hypocrite had either of you forgotten it well if arkwright hounds had blank day on that occasion it is very certain they did not on this for they had the run of the season the very fastest thing they had so far since the first of november minutes as hard as ever they could go with only one check and winding up with kill in the open they finished long way from home and the december evening was closing in and the rooks and the woodpigeons were thinking of going to bed as doddy and miss arkwright on their tired steeds rode slowly along towards home they were all by themselves for somehow or another they had managed to part company in the most natural way possible with papa and the hounds what are you thinking of doddy inquired fairy after long silence is it any use run of the fairy tinued she laughingly my offering you penny for your thoughts sir no ll tell you without that fairy said doddy was thinking do you know of that time just ten years ago when you were so ill and expected to live dear fairy do you remember his voice got very low just now and trembled somewhat yes doddy said she simply looking up into his face oh yes remember it so well and how you came to see me in your red coat and were so kind and the tears were in fairy eyes now doddy finished the story for her and somehow or other as he did so his arm crept round her waist and her head fell upon his scarlet shoulder as naturally as yes quite naturally and this is what he said yes dear fairy you are quite right came to see you in my red coat and you nestled your head upon my breast just as you are doing now fairy and you said to me in your childish way shall be your little wife some day shan dear doddy fairy my own darling will you be my little day and do you know fairy never so much as answered him which was very unkind of her little fairy but then you know there is an old saying and very often true that silence gives and we may presume that that is exactly what happened in this case for when arkwright hounds met two days afterwards everybody was apparently speaking at once and on one topic and this is what everybody said heard the news about major clayton and miss fairy no why they re engaged to be married to be sure house in the country pause iit cüitnírir part cook dweller in london all the year round it has for years been my secret ambition to take house in the country for the summer at which period of the year it is my custom to take my annual holiday until the present year however this darling wish of my heart has never to use turfy expression come off for the very good reason that my in my case is decidedly the better always insisted on going to the sea the very mention of the country to her is apparently gall and wormwood no james she always replies decisively when as the draw nigh we proceed to discuss house in the country our holiday plans and mildly make my annual but fruitless suggestion of the country no james reallycannot entertain the idea for moment really to be cooped up in some country place miles and miles away from any town or station in all probability not doctor near if any of us were taken ill papers two days old no books to read and not soul to speak to except the clergyman of the parish and his belong ings of course only going as we should to place of that sort for such short time no one round about would think it worth while to call on us it would be too terrible an ordeal at this point she would set her teeth and shud der knew that shudder well and always took it as signal for me to shut married men please house in the country feel perfectly certain she would continue my health would give way were even to attempt it the dear children too they would not like it half so well no nice sands for them to play about on no but lot of nasty and woods and places for them to scratch their eyes out and tear their clothes all to and then having said all she could say in opposition to my scheme she would add insult to injury by exclaiming but don let me stop you james dear can take the children and nurse and parker my wife maid to ramsgate as usual sure those lodgings we were in last year were so comfortable really was just like being at our own home and dear old miss mopson with that charming white hair of hers just like an old picture was so delightful how artful women are why if had dared to have proposed jaunt on my own account there would have been such shindy as never was however my wish was to be fulfilled at last and it came about in the following manner on certain hot morning towards the end of june turned out of my office about noon to walk to my solicitor office hard by to see him on some business or other now be it known the said solicitor john sooby house in the country by name besides being all that one of his profes sion should be in the matter of shrewdness and is away from his and parchments as cheery soul as ever you came across and hospitable to degree whenever oppor tunity offers notorious gourmet he not only does himself well but his friends into the bargain and an invitation to dine or lunch or sup as the case may be is not thing to be sneezed at by any manner of means the little luncheons in his private room in the city are proverbial therefore our business over did not want much pressing you may be sure when john announcing with smile of satisfaction that it was one clock jumped up from his chair and throwing open the door of his inner room invited me to enter and partake of what he was pleased to call snack in question being an elaborate meal provided by one of the most celebrated of the city restaurateurs whose establishment lay contiguous to john office when hungry man has partaken liberally of mayonnaise of lobster and galantine aux truffes winding up with or so of those most insinuating of tarts commonly called maids of honour sent specially from richmond washing the whole down with magnum of perrier jouet it would be but natural that he shojild feel on the best of terms not only with himself but with the world in house in the country that is precisely how felt after john sooby luncheon as leant back in the easiest of chairs puffing contentedly at one of my host fragrant cigars there was nothing wouldn have done for anybody at that moment short of backing bill verily believe you don puff know anyone puff suppose who wants place in the country for couple of months or so this summer do you inquired john in the confidential lazy sort of manner man assumes when engaged in the consumption of tobacco because if you do puff he went on ve heard of one this morning the very thing for you or anyone wishing to spend holiday in the heart of the country my client captain clatterton late of the hussars writes me word that wishing to go abroad for three months he wants to let his house in chalkshire for that period the shortest way though will be to read you his letter and you can then judge for so saying john producing it from his pocket adjusted his and proceeded to read as follows the old manor house chorlbury chalkshire june dear sooby wife and are thinking of going abroad for two or three months and want to find tenant for my house during my absence house in the country here are particulars old of old oak and that sort of thing about it ceous garden with the biggest cedar in england in the middle of it and which the tenant is welcome to fish in running through the bottom of it close to church and use of pony and trap produce eggs thrown in don want any rent all ask being for the tenant to pay the servants and take care of the place as if was here myself if you should come across anyone amongst your friends wanting anything of the sort put him on to me there good chap and you will confer an obligation on yours truly charles clatterton forgot to mention that chorlbury the nearest town is ten miles sounds nice don it said john folding up the captain letter and returning it to its enve lope the only drawback that can see he continued is the distance from the nearest town some people would make that an should myself for instance others on the con trary think the farther they are away from the madding crowd the better what anyhow there it is you might mention it amongst youra house in the country friends and if you should come across anyone inclined to take send him on to the effect of that letter on as it was on the top of john sooby very excellent luncheon magical in the extreme could see the old manor house with its its big cedar its full of strawberries and its fresh eggs to say nothing of the little church round the corner and the convenient in my mind eye as plain as pikestaff my mind was made up on the spot john exclaimed starting up seizing my astonished host by the hand you need not go house in the country further than this room to look for tenant for the old manor house chorlbury chalkshire take it myself my boy and you can write and tell captain what so as soon as you like bravo so you shall replied my jovial solicitor reciprocating the shake of the hand but and his countenance fell what will the wife say james dabchick my name omitted to say is dabchick my boy eh say don care what she says replied recklessly this is chance of enjoying myself that may never meet with again and intend to take advantage of it if my wife don care to she must stop away that all intend to go so whatever you do my dear fellow write to the captain this very night won you john promised so to do we had glass apiece of some curious brown sherry he produced to celebrate the event as he said and soon after departed to my own office in the most jubilant state of mind it is possible to conceive the first thing did when reached home that evening was to break the news to my wife she took it with most exasperating coolness and if she was angry which have reason to believe she was she concealed it remarkably well have often told you james said she when you have proposed this sort of thing before go into the country by all means if it pleases you take any sort of boxa house in the country you like but do ask me to go because nothing would induce me to do no dear james here she took skein of worsted in her mouth and in consequence spoke with course on purpose to aggravate me go to your old manor house by all means and when there sincerely hope you will enjoy yourself as for myself and the children here she sighed sigh redolent of christian resignation we must be content as usual suppose with miss mopson stuffy lodgings at the last time she spoke of that worthy person it was in terms of the highest praise she paused doubtless expecting to see some signs of wavering in my face but finding none she rose sniffed violently bad sign and hastily cramming her work anyhow into its basket left the room abruptly probably to indulge in what the ladies are fond of describing as good cry which idea of mine received confirmation by her appearing at dinner an hour afterwards rather red about the eyelids her too was in constant requisition during the meal alas all these signals of distress on the part of the injured martyr had no more effect on my obdurate bosom than water on duck back ha ha the summit of my ambition was at last reached had taken house in the country house in the country part ii trbere extract from dabchick diary of july aftainj chatterton writes to say that he has cleared out use his own expression and that can therefore enter on possession of the old manor house as soon as please hurrah three cheers and one cheer more for the gallant captain of the old not bad parody eh gilbert be off on monday next on monday morning accordingly having taken leave of my wife and children the former of whom received my farewell caress with frigid indifference took my departure in the best possible spirits and cab to the station en route for chorlbury and the old manor house railway people are evidently great observers of character for the guard evidently on the strength of my countrified birdseye tie shepherd suit and shoesa house in the country and gaiters he arranged my things for me in comfortable addressed me as squire expressing hope that the weather would keep fine for the farmers this was gratifying to my feelings and that guard received for his civility on the spot he left me and was immediately succeeded by the who appeared armed not only with all the sporting papers of the day but basketful of sporting novels and magazines as well guard had evidently told him was house in the country sportsman thinking it incumbent upon me to keep up appearances and in order not to make any mistake for did not know one paper from the other went in for the whole bag of tricks in sporting novel as well the boy was evidently impressed thankee sir said he pocketing the had presented him with would yer like form at glance sir git it for yer direckly if yer would very andy for the winners replied would have it not in the least knowing what it was he meant before the journey was half over however not only discovered the nature of the work in question but found myself sincerely wishing had never seen it for its possession involved me in weary conversation with sporting traveller concerning the forthcoming leger matter on which was profoundly ignorant and took not the slightest interest in and which only ceased when the train arrived at choribury oh what terrible confab that was and how hated my if he could only have guessed what gibberish it sounded to my ignorant ears he never would have wasted his time it was all my fault he saw me investigating the contents of form at glance and it gave him the cue at house in the country the mare seems to have coming appearance for the leger he remarked as looking up for second caught his eye yes she does replied at hazard the question is he went on whether boan erges won beat her have great doubts do you know in my own mind whether she can stay what do you think oh she can stay all right replied in confident manner in fact know she can added was positively frightened at my own impudence for didn even know her name ah that exactly what wanted to know said my friend with knowing wink at me as much as to say what downy pair we are aren we oh how pleased was when the train ran in to chorlbury station and was enabled to see the last of my sporting we said adieu to each other with mutual respect fancy he went away under the impression that was possessed of some private information regarding the favourite for the leger name unknown oh was getting on as country gentleman distinctly getting on beg pardon sir but aps you be the man for longchalke inquired the porter whog house in the country had collected my luggage touching his cap respect fully as he spoke yes the old manor house answered loftily ah thought as ow you might be was the reply as see the captain man outside with the lookin as if he was for on going outside sure enough there was servant in livery with decidedly military cut about him sitting in little village cart drawn by pony the menial in question excused himself in strong hibernian accent for not getting out of the cart bekase the pony couldn abide her head to be deed she can chimed in the porter who was listening with grin the fust and honly time as tuk hold on her she ketched hold of my harm and pretty nigh bit it in two afore she let go and when she done with me the wixen she runs the cart back and squeezes commercial gent as was standing there up agin the wall and made him holler just as if he was bein nice pony that thought to myself is she quiet when she does start inquired oh yes sorr she all right when she once off never fear replied the captain man all you ve got to do is to make dash like into the trap so as she ain got time to think ofa house in the country keeping you out and after that nothin won get in front of hev on the road between this and her stable you may accordingly having arranged for my luggage to follow on in the carrier cart and fee the expectant porter did as was bid and made dash into the cart sort of flying leap which landed me handsomely with my nose on the front rail it was one of those conveyances where the driver sits sideways the moment did so the pony who seemed to know precisely what had happened and was probably much annoyed at being done out of her fun gave snatch at her bit laid her ears back to her poll and started off at score occasionally varying the entertainment by breaking into gallop which action on her part had the same effect on the cart that rough house in the country sea has on small boat and nearly shook the inside out of me on this asked as the cart went wobbling about in the most unpleasant manner most days was the laconic reply it strikes me very forcibly then thought to myself that as far as am concerned the playful little creature will spend good deal of her time in the stable during my stay in this however kept to myself deeming it politic indeed to praise her in order to get into the good graces of the groom there was no denying the fact that she was all that worthy described rale beauty to look at being built quite on the lines of miniature racehorse and she was undoubtedly good one to go as the short time she took to do the ten miles conclusively house in the country part iii itcural tfelícítv extracts from dabchick diary of july rived this afternoon at the old manor house feeling after the shaking that had undergone in the captain just as if was landing at folkestone after rough passage from boulogne the old remedy pint of per rier jouet and biscuit on the spot much better take look round old manor house charming oak panels lattice windows postern doors and all that sort of just the sort of place you see depicted in the christmas numbers of the illustrated papers and ternally possessing that delightful musty sort of smell suggestive of rats damp and indifferent drainage which as every one knows is half the charm of an old house am reminded of my landlord military career at every turn in the are his house in the country and sundry cavalry sabres spurs bits all polished as bright as silver the again and indeed nearly every room in the house is adorned with portraits of his favourite chargers and photographs of him self and other members of the regiment in dress undress and mufti in the are hung up the gallant hussar sabretache and one or two other trifles for which can find the name arranged as sort of trophy really feel almost as if had been in the service myself captain dabchick wouldn sound at all bad now come to think of it martial law has evidently been the order of the day during the captain regime and am no doubt expected to keep it up the trim little parlourmaid sounds little gong in the hall at stated intervals during the day such as breakfast time etc she evidently enjoys it which is more than do hate gongs in fact do you always sound the gong like that when captain clatterton is here inquired oh yes sir replied the domestic in question always and if missis wasn down reckly master would take up the orn that angs in the all and blow away like did he really how very nice mentally house in the country ioi it is the same with everything the cap tain did this the captain did that all over the place begin to get rather sick of the captain church notice is literally round the corner so there will be no excuse for not going unless give out am buddhist or mormon or something house in the country called after lunch informed me that there being no country gentry round about the tenant of the old manor house is as consequence looked upon by the villagers as person of vast importance and great deal is therefore expected of him in the way of subscriptions presume said mildly just so replied the vicar ha it just occurs to me that next week we hold our village in your field too by the way trust you don object the captain always lent it to us most willingly and indeed was most liberal in every way sending out tea and coffee and fruit as well as giving us handsome subscription hope we may count on your aid as and with that the vicar produced little black containing list of sub scribers to the aforesaid show captain clatterton observed the good man in casual sort of way always gave guinea to my other charities such as the clothing club often two but of course the amount you would like to give entirely rests with yourself merely thought would mention ahem you understand exactly very kind of you thought to myself as forked out the sum named took the opportunity of hinting to the vicara house in the country that it might save trouble if he would kindly give me list of what was expected to give to during my stay so that should know don you know the vicar delighted at the notion declined the offered him and left hur riedly no doubt to make out the list in question after he had left it occurred to me that should have offered him tea not had one myself instead and went out to have look at the strawberries they were all covered over by net about three feet from the ground so lifting up cover enter and pick some eat away for ten minutes feeling something like rabbit on the warpath the while take another ten minutes straightening my back after the operation somebody else shall pick em struck me in the course of the afternoon that had not seen the paper made inquiries and found that it never came until the following morning unless the milkman brought it from chorlbury hate not seeing the paper so give orders that the said milkman be requested to bring it every day until further orders july standing on the lawn smoking pipe after late breakfast when am suddenly struck full on the nose by missile of some hoüse in the country it is the daily telegraph which the milkman has hurled over my front gate as he passes note from the vicar in course of morning enclosing the list asked him for of the different things connected with the village am expected to subscribe to during my stay am bound to say it is what dick swiveller would call rather at rough guess should say shall be lucky if get off under am rather sorry asked the captain man sends in after lunch to know if would like drive not if know it am cram full of straw berries and cream and daren be shaken up for worlds if the pony wants exercise tell him he had better take her out sorry told him as he returns in the evening decidedly the worse for liquor and with the cap tain pet pony done to turn if the captain was here says the trim parlourmaid oh he would go on should like to go on but to say the truth am not particularly partial to parley with an irishman at any time especially an inebriated one so content myself with remarking gravely to the parlourmaid that trust it won occur again fancy go down hundred per cent in the little parlourmaid estimation in consequence servants notice are particularly partial toa house in the country scene and no doubt she looked forward to one in this case through dinner when dreadful braying outside suddenly makes me start go to the and find that the noise emanates from the who accompanied by the whole population of the village are going through performance for my benefit it is dreadful ordeal and my nerves are so unstrung by annie laurie played all out of tune that feel strongly inclined to act up to the words of the song itself and lay me down and waited patiently to the end and then calling the leader of the band to me lied to him in the most extraordinary manner about the delight his talented orchestra had given me finishing up by presenting him with sovereign hoping most devoutly that he and his merry men would go straight off and spend it in drink not bit of it they went through the whole of their repertoire finishing off by singing for he jolly good veller of course me how often does the band come here mary inquired of the maid when having seen the last of them off the premises proceeded to go in for the quiet cigar had been longing for every wednesday evenin was the house in the country they do play beautiful don they sir master and missis she added was both very fond of the band and master used to bring out his orn and company them on indeed said sarcastically the effect must indeed have been lovely oh it was sir replied mary quite inno cently poor girl learned afterwards that her young man was in the band and played the trombone weather looks rather threatening have look at before retiring to bed going down hope it won be wet is wet cats and dogs not the word for it will play old harry with the straw berries put on mackintosh and go and consult the captain man find him rubbing away at smelling horribly of onions and looking as fresh as paint after his debauch of yesterday he says in answer to my inquiry after the pony health that she is all the bether for the exercoise of yesterday and is pleeful as kitten sorr this this believe to be lie as the pony looks to me rather dull and listless as to the weather he blood shot eye to the heavens now looking their that it will be foine entoirely in the house in the country this feel sure is only said to put me in good humour for the clouds are as black as ink and there is not the slightest sign of the rain ceasing go out into the village street meet farmer and consult him answers surlily that he is of opinion that we re in for long spell wet feel ought to say something about the hay but on consideration think it best not seeing that in all probability that belonging to the agricul turist in question is at this moment under process of spoiling think for second and then remark cheerily good day for fishing should ugh is the reply with growl like bear bout the only thing it be vit vor then he then walks off muttering to himself as he goes miserable hog your sty the best place for you think to myself as retire indoors nothing for it but and pipes all day very pleasant but unfortunately leads to enlarged liver would give trifle for table and friend or two wouldn even object to my wife for bit rain made the house feel quite damp and chilly substitute for the habitual house in the country to bed at eleven thoroughly sick of my own company and feeling very low and depressed raining hard woke up feeling very feverish and bad nothing but nightmares one after the other all night dreamt amongst other things that my wife had bolted with captain of marines pity the captain of marines can look at my breakfast but fancy straw berry much too wet for the strawberries opines mary the parlourmaid and she adds the slugs are eating of em awful murphy confound the slugs want to eat em never ceases to pour all day and consequently nothing to do but eat drink and pally the two latter am sure my liver is getting enlarged to bed feeling suicidal is it raining ask murphy the captain own man when he enters my room with my etc it is sorr he answers but think it looks clairer than it did an it be foine yit sorr get up and have look at the prospect on my own account can say share the sanguine viewa house in the country iog murphy takes of it for anything more gloomy never saw the captain or rather clatterton pet pigeons are all sitting huddled up on the dovecote or on the looking as if they thought being converted into pie was preferable to life under such disadvantages no strawberries plenty of whisky and baccy though ha ha slugs can get at that on second thought it almost pity they can for my liver can feel is increasing in size every hour find myself calculating how many pâtés de foie gras it would make in the hands of skilful pattiseur this can go on bed at io house in the country another wretched night couldn sleep for the life of me would have given ten ner or even pony for my wife presence with one of her favourite la they instantly act on me like laudanum is it raining ask murphy it is sorr is his reply bury my head under the clothes instantly in order to escape the remarks in his confounded irish brogue as to its getting clairer or broighter or loighter that feel sure he is about to make get up and look out of window it is raining harder than ever and clatterton pet pigeons look positively suicidal even usually as bumptious looking specimen of his race as ever beheld and an especial favourite with the murphy tells me bekase he such divil to foight sorr quite devoid of conceit this morning and no wonder as for the strawberries it no use thinking any more of them what the slugs don eat the rain is making jam of too bad of both of them for am so fond of house in the country ill everything seems to go wrong mary the parlourmaid has got such bad headache that she is obliged to retire to her room murphy takes her place and waits at table at luncheon he brings into the room with him fine aroma of the stable tobacco beer and onions thereby effectually doing away with what little appetite had to add to my comfort the milk man has carefully dropped my daily telegraph in the mud so that it is almost unreadable either luncheon or the smell of murphy has turned me bilious as well as mary sparks are floating about in front of my eyes my liver feel sure must be by this time an enormous size think of the jaundice and find myself breaking out all over into cold perspira tion stitch in time saves nine so donning mackintosh go out and consult murphy about doctor there is one close handy he tells me very intilligent young man of the name of perkins the capen he adds has greet regard for im for he foine shot and splindid don somehow regard these two latter as any guarantee of the doctor skill however send for him all the same he be company at all events think in he arrives he is as murphy described him young man with apparently house in the country plenty of intilligence and should imagine fair stock of assurance he looks at my tongue feels my pulse and applies the stethoscope having done which he sits down stares at me for fully couple of min utes shakes his head with great gravity and finally remarks that am very livery subject and that have had narrow shave of having some long latin word which pretend to understand and don how lucky sent for him tell him it was indeed he replies there is no say ing otherwise what might not have he rises to go and promises to call again in the evening meanwhile if send murphy to his house he will give him some medicine to bring back ask him to come and dine it will give him great pleasure meanwhile must not feel depressed general depression he goes on to inform me is very common about here some of the natives occasionally declining to go outside their houses for weeks he adds in casual sort of way as he rises to go that there are goodish many suicides hereabouts no wonder look hard at my razors of morning thought damn the doctor wish helhad not told feel more depressed than house in the country try little prescription of my feel much better in conse quence arrives to dinner first of all he goes out and interviews mary who is still hors de combat and returning rubbing his hands evidently thinks he is in for good thing the captain he informs me was never ill neither was his wife they were the healthiest couple he ever saw in he says this as much as to say don think include you in the same category because don we sit down to dinner say more out of compliment to the doctor than for any other reason pose may eat anything like may not oh yes oi should say long as you don it you know is his reply as am not in the habit of it as he calls it thought this rather an insulting remark on his part said nothing but contented myself with look ing at him in my sternest manner which however don think had the smallest effect as don fancy he observed it he had two helps of distinct helps having first solemnly warned me not on any account to touch any finished up by eating ii house in the country nearly the whole of large mayonnaise of lobster share as well as his own as he facetiously remarked could not help saying quietly you re not overdoing it hope doctor oh dear no thanks he replied one of those people you know who can eat anything with impunity ha ha he added with fiendish glee fancy do you know we poor devils have the best of it in the long run it only you rich fellows can afford to be what fastidious indeed confound the man cheek why if he had not forbidden me to touch it should have eaten as much lobster as he probably more cigar after supper during which the intilligent young sawbones entertained me with half the night firmly impressed with the notion that am suffering from cancer dropsy and every other disease under the sun circumstantial account of all the worst cases that he had had the treatment of both before and during his sojourn in the village with the result that lie awakea house in the country shall bar too much of that doctor in future life too short to be frightened to death like that about oneself july is it still wet murphy it is head under the bedclothes as usual to avoid hearing murphy lying weather forecast letter from my wife saying what delightful weather she and the dear children are having at ramsgate how much they are enjoying them selves and how she hopes am doing the same etc oh yes am enjoying myself rather letter from my landlord the captain at spa asking me how like the place he hopes it is fine because longchalke when they get spell of wet weather is not the most lively spot in the world no indeed it is not far from it think to myself feel sinking sort of want of tone about the system generally that can not be right biscuit and pint of perrier jouet ought not to do me any harm on the contrary give me fillip for lunch am just house in the country busy discussing it when in walks the doctor who of course goes through the form of being dreadfully shocked these stimulants in the morning are very injurious he says so apt to lead to fatty degener ation of the chrysanthenum or words to that effect if taken in but the good wine has given me just what fillip and don care for fifty doctors and their gibberish at this moment oh nonsense reply once in way it can hurt anyone try some yourself and if you ll believe it the doctor oddly enough is of my way of thinking once in way says he rubbing his hands of course would not do much harm and do you know my dear sir think will indulge for to say the truth feel little depressed myself this morning and in this damp weather champagne find is most valuable valuable assure murphy was quite right the village doc is most intelligent fellow we discuss the weather at the same time as the champagne and both agree that the one is as flat and dispiriting as other is lively and in vigorating the doctor looking with flushed face out of window says he thinks it the like lasting some time and strongly advises me to ask friend down the cheeriera house in the country the better by way of keeping off the blues good chap the doctor and take his advice and write off an invitation by this very night post who shall it be that the question have it young friend bob tolladay is the very fellow he always in chronic state of diffi culties and has been ever since ve known him but that circumstance never affects his spirits or what he calls his appetite and he is sure too to borrow pony from me during his stay no matter bob it shall be and no other written to bob and told him to come if possible io in better spirits than usual july raining this morning murphy it is sorr harder than iver but oi think it clairer towards head under bedclothes as usual to prevent hearing more jump out of bed quite briskly hurrah bob will be here this afternoon and then away with melancholy the bare thought gives me quite an appetite for break fast from bob have to pay messenger no matter what sil house in the country three to man of pleasure should like to know telegram which is short but satisfactory runs thus to dabchick longchalke all right with you at tolladay dear old bob knew he house in the country ii part iv at tbe dabchick diary continued july ashionable intel robert tolladay has arrived at the old manor house yes bob true to his promise turned up last evening just be fore dinner in fly from bury crammed to the muzzle with luggage brimful of spirits as usual notwithstanding his chronic state of difficulties and accompanied by familiar spirit in the shape of white terrier named joe who if am any judge of doggy physiognomy is quite as full of fun as his lively master if not more so bob cer tainly is the noisiest customer ever came across yet with bob arrival the old manor house changes its tone altogether no need to wish for children innocent prattle and pattering footsteps house in the country to be heard about the house to mention more noise than fifty children the prolonged ya hip he gave vent to as the fly drove up to the not only aroused all us inmates but must have been heard from one end of the village to the other sudden and unhappy thought hope bob won get me bad name about here out rushed the whole mary the cook and murphy from his stable close by without there shouted bob at the top of his voice rattling all the time with his stick at the door which the captain own man was now opening varlet delay exclaimed he in theatrical tones address ing the astonished murphy and frowning at him at the same time menacingly in the most approved melodramatic fashion then he turned to me ha ha that face he exclaimed as if he had only just caught sight of me but no it can not be he went on falling back step or two yes tis he tis he my friend and with that he rushed forward and held me in mock embrace to the intense amazement of the flyman the domestics and select audience of little boys and girls from the village fancy they all thought him mad and no wonder meanwhile the dog joe evidently determineda house in the country not to be out of it having first gone at everybody legs all round made series of dashes at clatterton pet as usual were pecking about in every direction finishing up with violent assault on the stable cat who had to take refuge up indeed she spent most of her time poor thing during joe stay at the old manor house house in the country well said bob when he had released me laying aside his tomfoolery for while and how are you my gay hermit eh so this is the old manor house is it and crafty crib too and say jimmy what pretty little slavey that is of yours no wonder you keep dabchick at the seaside you sly old dog you oh don you tell me still waters run know all about it my boy you don hoodwink dis chile not quite that irish chap too he looks like an original cross between mickey free and parnell what you ve got the old original little church round the corner that the christy min strels are so fond of singing about too perceive it must be the very identical one should fancy pon my word you re in clover consider plenty of lush on the premises pretty girl to wait on you and rub your bald pate as the song says and the pink un reg lar on sunday morning what more do you want should like to know and so he rattled on all the way to the house arrived there he must needs once more commence to play the fool ere ham once again hin my hold uncle ouse once more shall be old my julier exclaimed he in mock heroic accents for the benefit of the usually staid mary now all giggles directly he got into the hall and now old boy said he when he had beena house in the country relieved of his overcoat we have drink as soon as you like by the way wish you pay my fly for am clean of change you have good man do the same for you when you come and stay at my baronial and now for little quiet thought but not bit of it just as we were about to enter the bob caught sight of the captain hanging up in the hall yard of tin so help me ten men and boy exclaimed he in delighted accents ever heard me play the galop jimmy no then you ve missed treat can tell you why the my favourite instrument sir and can do the galop in style say it that shouldn koenig in his best days couldn have equalled play it you now and joe here shall sing at the same time such voice he got joe you rascal his terrier who eyed the which his master had just taken down from the wall with evident dislike when begin open your mouth and show em what you re made of do you hear or ij ll give you and then commenced the most awful perform ance or anybody else ever heard the horrible sounds that issued from the horn might have been meant for the galop but can say recognised it and when in addition the dog shutting both eyes lifted up his head and howled house in the country varying the entertainment every now and then with short bark could stand it no longer but shouted to bob to shut up for heaven sake or should go ha ha ha fine performance ain it said he not bit abashed but as you say it about time for gargle never said anything of the sort so lead on macduff bob in tremendous force how envy him his appetite and animal spirits he makes me laugh consumedly and as am told laughter is capital thing for the liver encourage him in his nonsense mary in state of giggle all the time regret to say dinner was failure the lamb having been kept wee bit too long in consequence of which it has got what bob facetiously calls the and is thereby uneatable mary thinks this such an exquisite joke that she is obliged to leave the room hurriedly and hear her and the cook exploding in the passage luckily there is curry to follow off which we dine bob says he likes curry because it makes him so jolly thirsty always the magnum of pol roger produced in his honour is in con sequence dead man long before the conclusion of the repast another bottle therefore is called for and drunk tell bob as dessert makes its appearance that ve got bottle of claret think he ll house in the country oh blow your claret says he his legs up on chair let have some more fiz old boy the froggies know the time of day much better than we do he goes on and they never drink claret after dinner besides my doctor told me particularly never to mix shocking bad thing for hiccup to lix your mean mix you liquors hie excuse me old hic ve got the hie send for the champagne bob says it better borrel than the last curious how after dinner one articulation is at fault ask bob how he accounts for it he says itsh too much talkin in quensh of which the hie mushles of the hiccup gerr out of the besht thing for it he says is curaçoa and brandy we try it one glass has no effect so we take another apiece singular thing but bob seems to have two heads when look at him ask him how he accounts for that he replies with an insane laugh drunk shir drunk ask gravely if he means himself or me you corshe ole boy says he rudely drunk ash david sow sheen it last half hie me indeed warreryoumean should hie to know he says this quite fiercely so apologise we shake hands and swear eternal friendship house in the country bob weeps bitterly and will insist on talking about his mother wish he wouldn for it makes me feel low myself propose glass of brown sherry to settle everything bob acquiesces and brightens up once more ll tell you what says he ll go and get the and play you do reply very fond of soothing after he goes into the hall for the and hear him upsetting all the captain accoutrements off the wall in his search for that instrument he returns with it and begins to play it must have been soothing for went straight off to sleep up what on earth makes the bed so hard blink and wink for minute or so and then the bitter truth dawns upon me am in my lying at full length on the whilst close by is bob reposing grace fully with his head in the snoring most hideously most respectable one fear of the curled up by his master with his head resting affectionately on his breast rise in dishevelled state and rather myself in the glass result not house in the country must wake bob easier said than done for every time attempt to touch him joe flies at my legs am at my wits end to know what to do when bright idea comes to the rescue bribe joe with biscuit to leave the room try it on immediately with immense success joe is as corruptible as the rest of em find and leaves his master without moment hesitation the door shut on him have another turn at bob wake up bob come wake up shout shaking him he evidently thinks he is in london and that am policeman for he grunts out allri robert allri old boy and goes to sleep again the rascal wo wake at last in my despair have recourse to the and sprinkle some on his upturned countenance it has the desired effect for muttering that it confounded wet night he wakes up and sitting up rubs his eyes and looks around him hallo old boy says he as cool as cucumber why we seem to have overslept by jove never thought of grasped the idea at once bob was perfectly right we had overslept ourselves and soda apiece at bob house in the country gestion and so to bed as good samuel pepys would say for wonder attended church for the first time since my arrival at longchalke persuade bob to accom pany me after considerable difficulty nervous and shaky after last night carouse and made worse by the consciousness that every eye in the congre gation is upon me bob on whom anything of that sort is lost abstracts his attention carefully from the service and stares at all the pretty girls in church in turn am bound to say his behaviour is not quite so decorous as it might be the way he yawns alone setting me off too by mere force of example is enough of itself to make people stare in the course of the service an awful circum stance happened making me wish for the moment that had never been born the litany had just commenced when all of sudden there arose from outside the door prolonged howl followed by sharp bark then sound of scratching was heard and another howl joe for pony exclaimed bob in loud whisper his face crimson with suppressed laughter better go out to him or the villain will howl the place nodded assent and he was just about toa house in the country do so accordingly when as ill luck would have it the village schoolmaster who sat next the door must needs get up and open it with view of driving away the sacri legious intruder the result may be imagined in boun ded joe with ous yelp nearly upsetting the schoolmaster and came gallop ing up the aisle in hot haste to find his master whom directly he ran to ground he proceeded to smother with caresses dared not look up and for the rest of the service was busily engaged cudgelling my brains for pretty speech wherewith to pacify the no doubt justly scandalised vicar bright idea ask him to lunch and then we can make it up over bottle of perrier jouet cut along home bob whispered at the end of the service and follow on want to speak to the vicar for moment in the bob not bit abashed collared joe under his arm and walked out of the church with the rest whilst made for the vestry profuse in my apologies for my friend dog house in the country vicar polite but somewhat cool and distant thought accepted my invitation to luncheon all the same and having doffed his surplice and had word or two with his clerk walked home with me unbent as we went along found bob shying stones at clatterton pet pigeons joe looking on and barking introduced the vicar who eyed him with evident distrust very fine and large specimen of the wicked man no doubt he thought bob full of fun as usual gravely introduced the vicar to his dog as joseph you saw him in church of course laughed he ha ha always thought until that joe was hindoo or dissenter or something of that sort don you know but he is evidently one of sir the vicar smiled feebly evidently failing to see the point of the joke was thankful when luncheon was announced not out of the wood even then bob must needs put his foot into it again before we had sat down ten minutes lots of pretty faces in church noticed this morning mr excuse me quite forget your name for the my name is luffey said the vicar with freezing bow oh ah luffey yes of course howa house in the country stupid of me went on bob well luffey as was observing saw several pretty faces in church this in particular the charmer who played the in white dress and large pretty girl thought she the young lady you allude to sir replied the vicar getting very red in the face and glaring through his spectacles at the unconscious bob is my daughter sir really replied bob not in the least taken aback you don say so now come to think of it do see somewhat of after this the conversation got somewhat io house in the country strained the vicar listening grimly whilst bob gave graphic account of particularly noisy dinner he had partaken of with some boon com panions at richmond on the previous sunday directly the meal was over the vicar hurried to escape fancy to you said he to bob with freezing politeness suppose he added sar castically we need not hope to see you at our evening service well it is rather doubtful replied bob cheerily but tell you what joe here shall go if you want to make up along with jimmy pretty jimmy capital idea call it this was the last straw and the poor vicar fairly bolted in disgust and now said bob to be done dear boy got any bowls on the premises no sorry for that because we have had game then there nothing for it old fellow that can see but cigar and the pink we adjourned accordingly to the room and bob having stretched himself out on the sofa with large cigar in his mouth and his favourite newspaper in his hand thought we were in for quiet afternoon was premature it seemed however for just as was comfortably nodding over novel my volatile friend jumped up and startled me with house in the country say old boy have you got cow on these oily old anorial premises of yours eh because if you have ve got the finest idea for spending an appy day you ever heard of in your life but the cow is essential have you got one replied that there were two in milk he enquired in milk answered one indeed has just weaned calf and

lump on the back of my head as big as an ostrich egg and feeling all over me as if had been first beaten like sack and tossed in blanket afterwards to finish up with mary informs me that cook and she

better than to drop down upon you again meanwhile old boy can you lend yours truly pony until we meet again leaving in hurry like this rather upsets one don you know house in the country never knew the time when bob was not being upset or that he did not want the useful sum he mentioned however was much too seedy to refuse now so having got what he wanted he shortly after took his departure murphy driving him over to rather should say he driving the captain was enjoying blissful the noise of voices whispering and the sound of the rustling of petti coats roused me from my reverie my wife had arrived îjî ïjî week hence we left longchalke my wife characterising it as the most place she was ever in in her life more than that have promised her never again to take house in the got at trainer story sot trainer story you may talk of jockeys and stable boys being got at from time to time by unscru pulous people and betraying the secrets of their employers in order to put few paltry pounds into their own dis honest pockets but never one of them ll be bound to say was ever got at so neatly as myself was some years lady too the artful little puss lord when think of how was taken in and done for it makes me positively wild it does thus spoke genial john truman the trainer at whose hospitable table had just par taken of most excellent lunch after delightful morning spent in his company on horley down watching the doings of the long string of race horses under his got at you don say so replied why you re the very last person in the world john should have thought anybody could have wormed any thing out of that you wanted to keep to yourself how was it am really quite anxious to well if you ll fill up your glass and light one of these cigars handing me box of the latter as he spoke ll tell you all about it said john though added he positively ashamed to do so for it tells so against myself you understand at the time am speaking of began john had not long commenced my career as public trainer and as you may imagine was naturally anxious to make name for myself in the racing world with all possible speed especially as had married wife and had got young family springing up around me luck has good deal to do with success in our profession as no doubt you are aware trainer may go on for years and have succession of bad horses in his stable is worse may have perhaps good one or two which he expects to do wonders and then they break down or go wrong in some way or another at the last moment there is nothing in my opinion so breaking may trainer as break down to the favourite generally speaking within few days of the race he is going for the racing public little know all the anxieties the sleeplessgot at nights the endless worries that fall to the lot of the trainer it is thankless task too for if he does succeed in getting his charge talking mind of delicate horse to the post and he wins it is the jockey always it seems to me who gets all the fat in the way of praise from the public at large at all events it is the the whom all the presents are lavished after the race but to return to my story in this particular year had four horses in my stable all belonging to one owner the late hazelwood the millionaire all good worst of the four indeed being far above the all entered for the derby you can imagine therefore the anxiety of the british public who were followers of hazel as they called man to find out which was the one from amongst the illustrious quartette that would carry the stable money on the derby day they very naturally went for the best public performer of the lot as and this was play actor who had won all his races including the champagne at doncaster and the criterion at newmarket and was in consequence firm winter favourite for the blue riband un fortunately for their judgment and as rule the public mind you are right we had another one at home who owing to temporary ailments of one sort and another had never been able to be rattled along and got properly fit for his engagements got at but had been tried at home to be better than any thing in the stable this was chestnut colt by the marquis out of convention called house an especial favourite with hazelwood whose greatest hope was to win the derby with him and with it large stake in bets which latter he could easily do with comparatively small outlay seeing that the chesnut was the worst favourite of the lot scarcely mentioned in fact in the betting whereas it was hard to obtain any thing like decent price about play actor with the spring coming on and not shilling of stable money as yet on the outsider you can imagine how important it was to keep claverhouse real merits to ourselves must tell you that though entered in the two thousand guineas we had no intention of running him therein the idea being to win it with play actor if possible starting stable companion called sharpshooter to make the running for him if play actor won which contingency none of us doubted for moment he would naturally become very warm indeed for the derby and we should be consequently able to get on the real article at long odds to win perfect fortune well the guineas was drawing nigh and was coming home with the horses one morning when who should come across on the road just as we were leaving the downs but lady standing all by herself as an old girl as you see anywhere ii fair stranger on the downs got at and quite one of the order ap parently she had ringlets and red nose pair of blue spectacles hat cotton gloves and dowdy old dress with ap parently no petticoats underneath and pair of awful boots with the tags hanging out to finish up with could see she wanted to ask me some thing so pulled up my pony and inquired if could be of any service oh yes she replied indeed you can have you may ask seen anything of maidservant carrying basket and butterfly net looking as if she was in search of anybody the fact is only arrived in these parts yesterday having taken myrtle cottage on the axminster road for the summer and going out for walk on the downs this lovely morning suddenly found that there were quantities of the most blue butter flies flitting about am great entomologist you must know so immediately sent my maid sarah back for my butterfly net telling her to bring out my luncheon with her at the same time and where she can have got to goodness only knows and here am so frightened and tired really don know what to the poor old thing looked so flustered and put out that hang me if didn think she meant faint ing or something so down got and suggested as we were only quarter of mile from my house that she should come on with me and wouldgot at drive her home later on accordingly offered her my arm as polite as possible and she took it in the most gracious fashion thanking me over and over again thought she would never have done indeed she informed me going along that her name was that she was the only daughter of the late admiral trimmer of whom perhaps might possibly have heard in connection with the baltic fleet in the crimean war no well she was surprised at that for the late admiral was most distinguished officer having pretty well worn out the subject of herself she must needs begin about the horses who were walking along just ahead of us what pretty creatures they were what darlings so quiet too did this one go in harness you should have seen the face of the lad on the back of play actor when she said this and do you give them all names what do you call this dear creature with the two white legs then claverhouse oh dear how charming how very charming he reminds me very much of horse that my late papa the admiral used to drive about years ago at cheltenham he died one day right in the middle of the promenade there just as we were driving home from an archery party at the timmins and remember so well my papa the admiral who was quite what people term sea dog calling him such dreadfulgot at names and shouting to him get up you lub ber but of course the poor thing couldn get up when he was dead could he when poor dear papa found he was really dead am sorry to say that he called him wickeder names than ever for daring to depart this life at such short notice or without any notice at all as one might say in such public place wasn it shocking hope you never swear at your horses trueboy beg your mean and have only to look at your face to know that the name is quite in accordance with your character or am no judge of physiognomy you don only at the lads occasionally and no doubt they richly deserve it the young rascals at and so she went on all the way to the house oh she was trimmer can tell you well sir in she came and having made her and the missus acquainted went to see after the horses while dinner was getting ready lor bless you when came back there she was sitting along side of my wife on the sofa as thick the pair of em as if they had known each other for years miss trimmer had got the baby on her lap vowing it was the finest she had ever she had seen good my little boy tommy was snuggling by her side trying with all his might to examine the interior arrangements of her gold watch with all the confidence imaginable dinner was announced soon after and missgot at trimmer made as hearty one as ever saw she said the lamb was delicious and the cham pagne exactly as she liked it neither too dry nor too sweet afterwards when we adjourned to the room she was pleased to give us little music particularly fond of music so she sat down to the piano and sang home sweet home to us in manner that went to our hearts my wife who had lately lost her mother fairly sobbed and as for me am susceptible man and own it felt as soft as ever did in my life the odd thing was that the croaking way she had when she talked seemed entirely to have dis appeared and her voice when she sang was that of fresh young girl it was the most remarkable thing ever knew another thing noticed too was that for such an aged one as she was she had one of the most lovely rows of teeth ever saw that though did not think much of for as my wife remarked afterwards when mentioned it to her they get up those things so well nowadays john that it impossible almost to tell the real from the the end of it was that the sprightly miss trimmer having stayed to tea took as affectionate farewell of my wife little tommy and the new baby as if she was on the eve of departure for china and finally went off to myrtle cottage in my pony carriage bound down in her own got at recognisances to pay us another visit before the week was out well now said my wife as soon as she was out of sight she not much to look at that certain but that the dearest old soul john ve met with for many long day the way she took to baby and baby took to her didn oo my own precious was something wonderful sure she wants to be its godmother she hinted as much john and what good thing that would be for am certain she rich and tommy too before she went away she gave father what the lady gave you ick un replied tommy grinning with pleasure ick un exclaimed his mother what does the child mean owed it bob ma an he said it was ick un said tommy producing sovereign as he spoke from out of one of the pockets of his knickerbockers why it thick un he trying to say explained to his mother who was not best pleased at her son and heir picking up such low expressions as she called them and requested me to keep him out of the company as much as possible for the future did not expect to see our new friend quite so soon again however the very next morning as was out on the downs with the horses it hadgot at been very wet in the early part so didn take them out until after breakfast who should see in the distance running in the most frisky manner after the small blue butterflies that are found in such quantities on the downs about here with large green net but our new friend miss trimmer couldn do otherwise you know than ride up and inquire how she was so did accordingly of course nothing would serve her but she must come and see the horses meanwhile it appeared she had driven on to the downs in her pony cart which she had left in the road and which now went and fetched for her and very neat turnout it was little pinewood village cart drawn by just about the prettiest little exmoor pony you ever saw and driven by maid having pioneered her to her mistress we joined the string once more and sent the lot gallop much to the amiable spinster delight who apparently took the keenest interest in the proceedings naturally take pride in my horses consequently could not but be gratified at her encomiums on their condition and good looks and should have been still more pleased had she not made so many silly remarks such as comparing my charges to her late papa stud and so that clearly showed she did not know one horse from another she took tremendous fancy by the way to play actor who certainly was as handsome as paint butj got at rather peacocky gentleman withal and not patch as regards looks on claverhouse who was as near perfect as possible in every respect why do you think she was so fond of play actor she said ha ha ha laughed john at the bare recollection why because his beautiful brown coat had such polish upon it when his clothes were removed that it reminded her of her papa the admiral mahogany when the butler removed the cloth after dinner previous to putting on the dessert did you or anybody else ever hear of such comparison scarcely day passed now without either my self or my wife seeing something of her either she would be on the downs catching butterflies when was there with the horses or else she would drive up in her cart to the house to see how little tommy and her future were thriving and as she never came without present of some sort for locket for my wife on her birthday some or toys for tommy or rattle for the visits needless to say were very welcome to my family if rather irksome to myself it was within week of the guineas when one afternoon as was sitting at tea with my trimmer who had dropped in as usual making one of the telegram was brought to me which at once opened and read anything particular john inquired my at well yes replied it from hazelwood saying that he and lord burlington and some friends are coming on saturday by the ten clock train from town so that you ll have to look up your best bib and tucker old girl and see that the commissariat department is in good order they ll take lunch directly they arrive no doubt and the trial must be in the afternoon as sam landham and tiny coates can get here from newmarket to take part in it until one trial broke in our visitor oh am so fond of trials must come too may truman where is it tell me all about it do why you ve never seen trial surely said looking at miss trimmer in astonishment oh haven was the confident reply why attended regularly every day in november last year when that dreadful woman was tried at the old bailey for poisoning her poor husband and fainted clean away the moment the learned judge produced his black cap oh yes and ve been to ever so many in the divorce court besides oh you don know me see my dear truman ah the trial am talking of is of very different kind to those you have witnessed and am afraid won interest you galloping our derby horses together just to see which is the best don you got at oh but should like to see it all the same if may declared my persistent visitor well have no objection sure said if you don mind sitting in our bedroom you can see it all from the window oh that will be lovely exclaimed miss trimmer in real or affected rapture how good it is of you to gratify all my foolish little fancies well saturday came and with it my employer accompanied by lord burlington his confidential friend and adviser and one of the most knowing cards on the turf sir george punter another swell who wasn born yesterday as the saying is and captain tom topper the gentle man rider our first act after luncheon was to make dash for half dozen touts who were on the watch in small plantation hard by these we collared after struggle and having brought them along in triumph locked them into barn until our business was over that feat accomplished out came the horses and having mounted the two jockeys from new market on play actor and claverhouse and lads on the other two the trial duly came off with no onlookers besides ourselves on the spot and poor dear harmless old miss trimmer at my bedroom window no need to describe the trial suffice it to say the result proved to us most conclusively that claverhouse was in his very best form and that bar accident the derby wasgot at as great certainty for him as the guineas was for play actor directly after the newmarket race the public would be sure to rush on play actor at short price whilst jock hazelwood and his friends were quietly taking all the long shots about his stable companion poor public thought though not by any means capitalist may add that before the party left for the station requested hazelwood so good thing did deem it to let me stand in with him to the tune of monkey on play actor and claverhouse respectively and an extra fifty on the double event was precious when sat down to tea can tell you sir and my first words were well miss trimmer do you want to back the winner of the derby at fifty to one because if you do now your time ma am fifty to one good gracious me exclaimed miss trimmer here let me see if put this note on that dear play actor whom am so fond of shall noughts are nought ten fives are fifty why that five hundred should really win five hundred pounds truman oh dear how useful it would be just now for that orphanage am so interested in and so in want of funds too as that good man the reverend silvertongue wrote me word only last week that what you win miss trimmer suregot at enough replied only you would not do it by putting it on play actor claverhouse is the one between you and me and the post ma am play actor won run in the derby at miss trimmer as woman of business grasped the situation readily that of course explains it at once she said understand exactly all about it play actor is the better horse but for reasons of your own you are not going to let him compete in this great equine contest that is so is it not very good then here truman is my note for immediate investment on claverhouse what do you call the race the derby oh yes shall remember that until get home and then will write it down think of the song darby and joan know it then sure to remember all right miss trimmer said laughing as put her note in my pocket and wished her ll see to it for you this very next monday and if you re not gainer of five hundred pounds by the transaction may never execute commission for lady again well sir play actor won the two thousand though not quite so easily as anticipated and of course the public made him favourite for the derby the odd part of it was though that when our commissioner put in feeler by way of seeing what he could get about claverhouse hegot at found to his astonishment that every one of the big books had been snapped up previous to the race for the guineas here was pretty go and how to account for it did not know not tout looked on at the trial that was certain for we scoured the only place of concealment they had little plantation on the and locked them up in barn afterwards as have already described the stable commissioner himself was not even aware of our tactics until after the two thousand the only person literally who knew anything was poor harmless old miss trimmer who by the way my wife wrote me word to newmarket had been suddenly telegraphed for to cornwall to the bedside of sick relative and to think of her in the matter was simply absurd the upshot was that hazelwood and his friends instead of getting the long prices about claverhouse they expected had to put up with what they could get it was sell of course somebody for once was cleverer than we were and who that somebody was we should uncommonly have liked to have found out we managed to discover who the taker of most of the long shots certain gay young spark named lawless who until lately had held com mission in one of her majesty cavalry or infantry regiments forget which and who having got tired of the army had taken to the turf he was after due consideration written to on the subject io got at and was threatened by hazelwood that if he did not disgorge some of the spoil claverhouse would have the pen struck through his name for the derby instanter what do you think this impu dent young dog reply was you can guess no should think not indeed it was simply this scratch away old fellow yours in liquor frank old jock hazelwood was in such rage when he got this reply to his letter that really think he would have scratched the horse if he could have got at got decent price about play actor but there again he was forestalled by the public so as have said he had to make the best of bad job jock hazeluwod got at and get the best price he could the commission believe averaged to all round when the money was got on and not before play actor was withdrawn from the derby to the chagrin of the public for whom am bound to say felt sorry had the horse run though he would never have beaten claverhouse who was street in front of him and who won in canter so it was all the same in the long run had been so busy with my charges previous to the derby that had hardly given miss trimmer thought however on our return from epsom for took the missus you may be sure we found letter from her dated from an hotel in london congratulating me on claverhouse victory and saying that she was returning to myrtle cottage on the following monday and would do herself the pleasure of driving over in company with friend who would be with her to see us the very next day if it would not put us out she added she would come to luncheon at one clock then my wife and were on the at the front door and very shortly we saw the village cart drawn by the pretty exmoor pony coming along at best pace but as it neared the house my wife suddenly exclaimed why john who on earthcanitbe it her right enough but the lady driving is not miss trimmer and there gentleman along with her whom ve never seen before to my well up to the door they drove and handinggot at the reins to her companion out the lady as pretty girl as ever saw jumped running up to my astonished wife she gave her hearty kiss and then coming up to me held out her hand and said in the croaking voice of miss trimmer how ye do truman got any trials going forward for me to look on at out of your bedroom window nearly tumbled backwards into the passage in my astonishment and the truth of the whole business flashed across my mind in an instant there was no longer any mystery as to how it was that we were forestalled in the market lord how had been fooled and by woman too forgive me both of you said the whilom sportive dragon holding out pretty little hand to each of us plead for your bad wicked god mother cried she seeing suppose that looked rather put out appealing to the baby and stooping over to kiss it as it lay in the arms the baby in answer held out its little arms and cooed as much as to say do all she snatched the child away from its nurse and smothered it in kisses who could resist such an appeal from young and pretty woman my wife who of course began to cry and hugged the fair penitent on the spot couldn for one and couldn for another and now said she after returning the baby to the nursemaid and turning to the gentleman in got at the cart having made it up all round suppose introduce to you my husband frank well of course we made friends with him too and we sat down five minutes afterwards to lunch the merriest party of four that ever my had inside its walls open con fession is good for the soul they say and when the cloth was cleared and the servant had left the room lawless née trimmer made clean breast of the matter and told us all about it she was an actress she informed us yes and one too thought to myself when frank lawless fell in love with her and married her and as his father quarrelled with him in consequence and he had nothing to live upon but small sum left him by his mother he left the army and went in for the turf mentioning one day to his pretty wife that he thought he could make his fortune straight away if he could only ascertain which was the right one of jock hazelwood lot for the derby she determined to give him the benefit of her experience on the stage and endeavour to find out accordingly they took myrtle cottage and down she came got up in the character of sportive dragon her first appearance in the part as she what success you are aware her husband landed the best part of forty thousand pounds on the double event for which he had to thank his wife entirely judging bygot at the affectionate glances saw him perpetually stealing at her fancy he was not ungrateful that loving cup you see on the sideboard yonder with an equestrian model of the celebrated john graham of claverhouse on the lid was their joint present to me in honour of having trained the winner of the derby as for the presents lawless lavished on her little god daughter and tommy to say nothing of my wife they were too numerous to mention the boys came in too for their share the boy who looked after claverhouse especially having reason to remember lawless bounty but what pleased me most of all was that the little woman kept her word to the letter about giving the five hundred won for her on jock hazelwood colt to charity for she divided every penny of it amongst different useful institutions in need of help so you see some good came after all from my being the queen of the ijc piteen of fije mu chapter you don really know what has become of miss nelly can give me the slightest clue to her present whereabouts indeed indeed don edward you might trust me sir to tell you if did even if miss nelly had forbidden me to tell soul would have broken my promise to her on your account would truly but since she went away after the sale of the old place just fifteen months ago ve had no tidings good or bad of her saw her off poor dear in the train to london third class ticket she took she as had never travelled in any other but carriage in all her born days before and that the very last saw of her you let me hear from you from time to time miss nelly won you said just before thei the queen of the arena train moved off and she promised me she would sir but except letter with no address saying that she had arrived safe and sound iir london and was looking out for employment have never heard from her from that day to this or whether even the poor darling is alive or dead no more know than you do edward and that is indeed edward arden eldest son of country clergy man and lieutenant in her majesty navy had left england in his ship just two years before for lengthened cruise in the mediterranean having previous to leaving plighted his troth to sweet nelly craven the only daughter and child of craven of headley court close by his father rectory one of large family and arden his father having little besides the stipend derived from his for him good one the chance of speedy marriage for the lovers seemed remote one afraid nelly we shall have to wait long while said ned with sigh promotion is slow you know darling and feel certain your father would object to anybody under post fear so too dear ned was nelly reply nestling her head as she spoke upon her lover shoulder but am not afraid to wait dear ifthe queen of the arena you are not she continued looking bravely up into his face and trying her hardest with but poor success to restrain the tears that would keep welling up into those liquid violet eyes of hers at the thought of the inevitable parting on the morrow the lovers corresponded regularly at first nelly letters were as cheerful as could be and evidently written in the best of spirits after while however ned arden always anxious as true lover should be fancied he could detect false ring about the apparent assumed by the writer was there some hidden trouble he knew nothing about to make his brave little girl unhappy he thought to himself he chafed and worried himself so at the bare idea as to cause his messmates to wonder what on earth was the matter with their friend ned as rule as jolly sailor as ever broke bit of biscuit is tooth or is swateheart ned me boy inquired pat mahon rallying his brother officer after his quaint irish fashion on his lowness of spirits if it your swateheart sure and symathoize with ye heartily yes indeed moine know is perpetually making me feel unasy the decateful little divil and many toime do feel inclined to say to ye all and jump overboard because of her oh it miss norah the flirt intirely never mind ned me boy said the irishman taking his friend sj the queen of the arena arm as he spoke come down in the and we ll have glass of grog and forget all about ned was not kept long in suspense for in nelly next letter out came the secret she was very very unhappy she wrote so unhappy ed couldn think my poor little girl exclaimed the lieutenant at this point giving the letter fond kiss ere he resumed reading she was sure something dreadful had happened to papa some terrible money loss she feared by his manner he wandered aimlessly about all day and at night contrary to his wont for as rule he was the most abstemious of men when by heavily she had begged him tothe queen of the arena let her share his trouble whatever it was but he to laugh away her fears indeed by assuring her it was only her fancy that he was merely out of sorts strange men too had been to the house to see him whose visits had the effect of leaving him more depressed and queer in his manner than ever she wound up by saying that she could not help thinking losses on the turf had got something to do with it for instead of going to newmarket for the autumn meetings taking her with him as he usually did he had this year for the first time in her recollection announced his intention of remaining at home she was sorry for this for both their sakes for they always did him good those visits to newmarket and if there was one amusement in this world she liked more than another it was galloping about on the heath it was second only to hunting in her estimation and that was saying good deal ned was terribly exercised in his mind about this letter he had heard when he was last in england sundry rumours of craven heavy losses on the turf his father the vicar indeed had told him gravely on one occasion that if the squire went on much longer as he was then doing he very soon would not have roof over his head he had taken little heed however of the remark at the time knowing as he did the vicar prejudice against racing and its attendant the queen of the arena he had no doubt now in his own mind that nelly was right in her conjecture and that the squire had sustained such loss as to bring about serious crisis in his affairs all he could do was to hope for the best and await the arrival of the next batch of letters for further news with what anxiety he waited may well be imagined and could he have foreseen the news that was in store for him when they did arrive he would indeed have found it hard to contain his feelings it was nearly three months after he had received nelly letter telling him the trouble she was in about her father that ironclad the thunderer to which edward arden belonged arrived off naples in due course the letters for the ship amongst them three for ned which he hastily took to his cabin to read better come into the and have glass of grog first ned me boy if your heart gone off with another chap it cheer ye up and make ye careless like sung out his irish friend pat mahon who had evidently not got letter from his swateheart as he called the pretty girl who was waiting patiently in dublin until her saw his way to marrying her but ned paying no heed to his friend natured chaff hurried down into his cabin and at once proceeded to overhaul his letters one hethe queen of the arena saw was from nelly one from his father and the other superscription was in strange hand he opened his father first at the same time you receive this wrote arden you will doubtless get the formal intima tion from your late uncle the admiral lawyers of the good fortune that has befallen you my poor brother should tell you died last week you are rich man now my dear boy what on earth does he mean exclaimed ned and pray as such accept all our heartiest congratula tions of course you will now say to the navy get leave for the present at all events and come home as fast as you so far the contents of his father letter had only astonished him but the next and concluding paragraph fairly horrified him thus it ran and now must give you piece of bad news as long ago predicted there has been complete crash at the court the squire being missing one evening at search was made with the result that he was found lying dead in the park the doctors said it was heart but have reason from something that has come to my knowledge since to think otherwise it is sad business and feel his loss terribly for he was good friend to me and gentleman every inch of him the queen of the arena misfortune did not end here am sorry to say on the squire affairs being gone into carefully it came out that he had been gambling for years to an extent that we none of us even dreamt of not only was he himself absolutely penniless when he died but unfortunately poor nelly fortune has gone with the rest she having sold her reversionary interest short time doubt for the purpose of helping her father poor girl the whole fact been sold and believe the sum realised did not cover the squire debts by some thousands of course we offered nelly home here but she was not to be persuaded and went off to london early one morning before any of us were aware of her intention taking with her the chesnut hunter that the squire bred and which she was so fond of what has become of her none of us know as she has never communicated with soul since she left she was always wild wayward girl but we were all fond of her and do hope she is in good hands happy of course she can not be know you will be sorry for your old playmate in her great sorry oh god groaned poor ned hurling his father letter to the ground in frenzy of grief fancy talking in that callous heartless way of my poor little girl my mother and sisters and all of them probably calling her proud because shethe queen of the arena declined to stay at the vicarage suppose in their they thought it would be good for her to look at the dear old home she loved so well every time she went to the window pah it makes me sick to think of it think can see her poor darling going off to london but as brave as ever but your trouble shall not last long nelly not long it will go hard if don find you out wherever you may be before many weeks if not days are over my in his excitement ned had quite overlooked nelly letter he now tore it open and read as follows dearest ned is over between us forever my poor father is dead and leave here for good and all to seek my livelihood try and forget that we ever met it is very very hard but it will be best for the last time dear ned and so you re gone to london to seek your livelihood eh nelly mused ned poor little girl sighed he fancy can see her at this moment trudging along through the snow with that same plucky look on her face that have seen come over it when she was riding at bigger fence than usual out hunting seeking for situation as governess in the queen of the arena family or companion to an elderly lady or some thing equally unpleasant never mind nelly your troubles won last very long now not if can help it at and ned having first impressed kiss on his lost mistress missive placed it carefully away in certain black satin embroidered with blue heaved deep sigh and proceeded to turn his attention to the remaining letter which still lay unopened on the table it proved to be the very one mentioned by his father as likely to be received at the same time as his own from the solicitors to his late uncle admiral arden the letter which was long one was in effect notification that their late client had bequeathed to his nephew edward arden whom by the way he had never so much as seen the whole of his him everything he possessed in fact and as that everything was good for the admiral besides being decidedly was of penurious not to say miserly disposition father the vicar was not very far out when he told his son that he was now to all intents and purposes rich man the lawyer after passing sundry encomiums on his late client many virtues went on to con gratulate his successor on succeeding to such fine property any instructions it should please him to give to his firm he might depend wouldthe queen of the arena receive their very best attention he took the liberty too of mentioning that should edward arden be in want of any ready money for imme diate use he begged he would draw upon the firm to any amount ned gave prolonged whistle well exclaimed he wonders will never cease that very certain an hour ago was miserable lieutenant in the navy with not copper beyond my pay and now here am bloated landed proprietor with ten or fifteen thousand year and bigger swell than the skipper himself my poor old uncle hated my father too it my belief it was my being in the navy did the busi ness well it rare bit of luck anyhow and be off and show the lawyers letter to the captain at once by jove exclaimed ned as he gathered up the said letter and prepared to leave the cabin if only knew where my nell was and could feel assured that all was right with her should be the happiest man in the universe at the present moment io the queen of the arena chapter ii being readily ob tained from the who whilst congratula ting his lieu tenant on the stroke of good luck that had come to him took the op portunity at the same time of expressing his regret that the service was about to lose such promising young officer made the best of his way to england as fast as he could arrived there his first act before even going to the pater nal rectory was to make straight for headley court this he found shut up and in charge of caretaker who being stranger in these parts as she said of course knew nothing of poor nellie bonner at the west lodge she thought the most likely person to give him any information he required ah of course the very person wonder didthe queen of the arena lt not think of her before exclaimed ned brighten ing up for he suddenly recollected that bonner was nelly old nurse of whom she was very fond and consequently the most likely per son of any to know her whereabouts thanking the woman for her trouble he jumped impetuously into his hired fly and bade the driver go to the lodge as hard as he could bonner was at home and that glad to see the lieutenant as she couldn express she told him but alas the moment he mentioned nelly name her face fell for as has been already related at the commencement of this story she was unable to give him any information about her whatever at first he thought that the old nurse was deceiving him purposely nelly possibly having forbidden her to betray her whereabouts indeed he hinted as much bonner however stuck to her story with such pertinacity and seemed so hurt at his sugges tion that he had no alternative at last but to believe her grieved and disappointed he bade the flyman drive to the vicarage with his things and say that he would follow on foot to say the truth he felt strongly inclined to go back to town there and then and probably would have done so but for the fear of being thought unfeeling by those at home the fact was he could not bear the sightthe queen of the arena of the place now there was no nelly on the scene and always sensitive he dreaded the remarks his parents and sisters would be sure to make about the fiasco at the court the latter were ing girls enough but as is often the case with people who live all their lives buried in country village to degree they had never either been very intimate with the squire daughter for not only did they not possess single taste in common but nelly had always politely declined assisting at mothers ings and institutions all of which were needless to say extensively patronised by arden and her daughters nelly though in spite of this terrible remissness on her part was made very welcome in the cot tages whenever she paid any of them visit the inmates liked to look at her pretty face as they said and listen to her pleasant different to the miss ardens who were always bouncing in and out of their cottages and cramming re ligion down their throats whether they liked it or no those ladies on the whole by no means approved of their brother undisguised admira tion for miss craven and were perpetually making spiteful little speeches about her for his especial benefit which made him wince again and long to retaliate in no measured terms but for fear of showing his hand for they knew queen of the arena they might the true state of affairs between nelly and their brother what pity it is that nelly craven when she sings is so dreadfully theatrical in her manner her voice is really very tolerable one but in my opinion she takes away all pleasure to her hearers by singing in the forced style she thus the eldest miss arden for the benefit of her family generally as they walk back from at headley court poor nellie she had had the ill fortune to be taught by the eminent mistress who had taken her in hand not only how to use her voice but to pronounce her words so that people could hear and understand what she was singing about passionately fond of her art and sympathetic to degree she seemed to pour her whole soul into her song and it was this that gave offence to the virtuous miss ardens those ladies on the contrary would go through series of duets such as oh wert thou in cauld blast in manner calculated to freeze one blood on the hottest night no wonder then that ned fond though he was of his family should rather dread facing the music other words having to sit down and look pleasant whilst his amiable sisters made disparaging and uncharitable remarks on the one person he loved best in the whole of the wide world the queen of the arena as he walked along smoking cigar there were two things he made up his mind to do one was to keep his temper whatever was said the other to be off to london the very first thing in the morning the whole of his family were assembled at the evidently on the for him as ned towmi entered the vicarage demesne and he was imme diately seized and gushed at by the female portion until he was nearly breathless they were indeed all unfeignedly glad to see him and momentarythe queen of the arena sensation of remorse struck ned when his mother remarked in an injured tone of voice we thought dear edward you would have come here straight from the the proverbial fatted calf was killed to greater extent than usual that evening in honour of our hero arrival and his coming into his uncle property to the latter event may possibly be attributed the appearance during dinner of wine hitherto quite unknown at the vicarage table the miss ardens positively got quite frothy under its genial influence and in the excitement of discussing their brother windfall and trying to find out what he meant to do with all his money etc they totally forgot to fire off one or two spiteful little shots against absent nelly craven which they had expressly prepared for the which dispensation of provi dence edward needless to say was exceedingly grateful after dinner however when the ladies had retired and ned had the vicar all to himself he lost no time in begging his father to tell him all he knew about the sad affair at the court and nelly in particular about the former the old gentleman as mat ter of course had plenty to say and could have gone on indeed if necessary all night about it but as regards miss craven he was no wiser thanthe queen of the arena ned himself he had offered her home an invitation thought fit to the good vicar here put on his most pompous manner she never made confidante of your mother and sisters which really think she might have done after knowing us all her life as she had and finally left the stealth might almost went off to london with no other companion but that horse of hers queer girl the vicar shaking his head solemnly as he filled himself glass of wine and passed the decanter on to his son ned saw that he could do no good by seeking further information in that quarter so he very wisely changed the subject tired as he was it was but sleepless night that he passed under the paternal roof his mother in the adjoining room heard her pacing up and down impatiently long before day break and attributing it at once to neuralgia her own pet no doubt on board that horrid damp draughty ship went down to breakfast armed with an infallible remedy for the same she always carried about her in small bottle the smell of which was of ous nature and pervaded her whole person which she had made up her mind to administer to him on the spot adding an injunction to remain in histhe queen of the arena own room all day the infallible remedy being of not the slightest avail without that accompani ment poor arden all her trouble had been taken for nothing on entering the she found her son as she expected looking ill and careworn her daughters sulky and the vicar evidently by his manner put out about some thing she was not long in finding out the reason ned had just given out his intention of leaving them that very morning for the queen of the arena chapter iii arden isn it too bad of this dreadful frost to put in an appearance the very first day of your visit too it really looks as if the clerk of the weather does not approve of your hunting and has done it on purpose shipley manor too is one of our best meets and we should have been sure of run not only that wanted to show you that pretty girl we were all talking about last night who has been down hunting in these parts lately and who swam the river and pounded the whole field last week wish knew who she is she is so pretty give anything to know her thus pretty lovell his hostess to our friend edward no longer detri mental but man of property and in consequence most welcome guest in country houses more especially those in which there were marriageable had arrived at longfield park the night before with couple of hunters for the doublethe queen of the arena lg purpose of having day or two with the old away hounds one of the most celebrated packs in england and shooting the longfield coverts and who now appeared in the arrayed in suit of tweed instead of the scarlet coat snowy leathers he had hoped to have worn and would have but for the inter vention of that inveterate enemy to jack ned was quite as disappointed as sporting lovell for though fond of shooting rather should say riding over his complaint as he himself would say far better am afraid ned was an indifferent sportsman in the true sense of the word for he knew nothing and probably cared less for the science of fox hunting drawing wood especially big one fidgeted the impetuous sailor to death nearly but when they got away and the galloping and jumping set in in earnest then he was altogether in his element an indifferent horseman and possessing not an atom of judg ment he atoned for both deficiencies by the reck less way in which he as the master said as if he had spare neck or two in his pocket when he first took up his abode at his late uncle the admiral house and started hunting down there the two or three crack men of the who not only possessed nerve butigo the queen of the arena judgment as at ousting them from their position went out with the full intention of taking the shine out of him as they termed it but it was no good master ned reckless horsemanship backed up as it was by the good cattle he rode proved too many for them and they were forced at last much against their will to give in jump over some big posts and rails on to the line right in front of an express train leav ing him some three fields ahead with the hounds all to himself effectually settling the question of supremacy even the huntsman declared that he never saw such an audacious chap to ride in all his born days it was now nearly twelvemonth since ned hadthe queen of the arena igl left the navy and set up as country gentleman and though he had been indefatigable in his search for nelly both on his own account and through paid agents yet he had not as yet been able to find single trace of her he began to fear the worst and his gloomy thoughts concerning miss craven almost drove him mad at times no wonder he rode in the reckless style he did it was his only solace poor fellow shooting somehow did not answer the same pur pose at all his thoughts would keep wandering to his lost sweetheart in spite of him causing his friends to declare as they watched rocketer after rocketer fly away unhurt that though there was no denying the fact that ned arden could ride like good one he was shocking bad performer with gun the mammas too couldn make him out at all sailors as rule said they are only too fond of flirting with every pretty girl they meet but this young fellow seems quite an exception to the general and they put him down at last as one of those silly selfish young men who care for nothing but their hunting and other horrid amusements you see these good ladies knew nothing about nelly craven we left edward arden at breakfast in country house lamenting the sudden appearance of thefrost the queen of the arena hunting of course being out of the question there was nothing for it but for the host and his guests to have resource to their guns pour passer le temps accordingly word having been sent to the that the intended beating some of the small coverts near home the guns were got out and all were ready for start when as if the elements were determined to spoil sport down came the snow ah well we re done brown now and no mis take exclaimdd lovell keenest of nimrods and man never happy unless in the pursuit of some sort of sport or other no matter what snowing hard and looks like lasting too continued he with glance of disgust out of the window at the gloomy landscape beyond there nothing for it now you fellows afraid but baccy and and baccy ned my boy give you ten in hundred and play you for fiver there was indeed nothing for it as the squire observed but an adjournment to the where later on they were joined by lovell and the ladies staying in the house very noisy pool was in full swing when the door opened and there entered sprightly lady of decidedly sport ing appearance at whose arrival shout of ap proval went up from all present fernely prettiest and blythest of her sex was indeed popular character with both highthe queen of the arena and low the men worshipped her and even the ladies liked is saying great deal shan like that woman know thought ned to himself as the new arrival chattered away with the greatest volubility chaffing everybody right and left and making the ring again with her laughter he was not fond of these very sporting ladies as rule but in the brief space of how ever this lively lady had somehow or another entirely made him change his opinion and by the time the sounded ned arden like the rest had become one of her most devoted admirers and now my dear exclaimed she addressing lovell what do you do you think ve driven over here for this nasty snowy day what should you say if told you had found out all about the girl in the brown habit who has been down here hunting of late and cut us all down one after the other no exclaimed in her turn her friend lovell clapping her hands with delight do tell me all about her rose dying to know sure she got said so from the first now hasn she well restrain yourself you impetuous person replied her friend and you shall hear all about it you weren out last wednesday you little the queen of the arena stupid when we had that good thing from tackley wood but no doubt lovell whom know to be raconteur of the first water told you all about it so need not enlarge upon it now can only repeat it was good best gallop we have had this season to my mind well my dear before we started for the meet said to my husband tom dear whenever they find at tackley the fox invariably makes as you know for middleton now as want several little things in the town and the doctor tells me must not do too much just now think if you don mind ll order jenkins to take the brougham into barleyford get what want and wait for me at the crown can then drive home com capital plan replied tom and having given orders accordingly off we started for the meet where the first person we saw with everybody staring at her as usual as if she were wild beast instead of very pretty girl was as tom and had christened her between ourselves well they found almost directly as you know and away we all went and self well in the van my dear was on dear old whitelegs the best horse ever rode and the best tom declares he ever had in his stable but can assure you the queen of the arena though flatter myself can go bit above the average wasn in wasn in they ran into him in the open at last and was one of the happy few who got to the end but got there before me and when lord naseby came up to me to present me with the brush insisted on his giving it to her instead and what is more rode up and congratulated her couldn help couldn poor little thing she looked so pleased and made the noble master such pretty little speech that he fell in love with her on the he told me afterwards well my dear my lord got his second horse and away they went to draw for an afternoon fox and tom along with them whitelegs had had about enough of it however and so had to tell you the truth so as captain ward and his wife were going my way turned my back on the hounds and went along with them dear old whitelegs looked as he was turning his head to see wistfully after them with those great kind eyes of his as much as to say you fellows don half like leaving you tired as dear old whitelegs we had very pleasant ride to barleyford the three of us eating our sandwiches and empty ing our flasks on the way at the crown the wards and parted com pany and having seen whitelegs drink some nice queen of the arena warm gruel and kissed his dear nose got into the brougham which was ready waiting for me and having got one or two things wanted in the town started for home well we had just got as far as the crossroads as you know are about two miles out of looking out of the window who should suddenly see but my little friend miss on foot if you please leading her horse which was and she herself in tears pulled the as you may fancy and was out of the brougham like shot much to the coachman astonishment my dear child screamed running up to poor little what is the matter have you had fall or what she sobbed it isn that but my horse is and shall miss the train it was then just ten minutes past and dear me don know what shall do for there is not another until seven clock and that will be too and the poor little woman quite broke down put her head on my shoulder and cried fit to break her heart nice romance weaved for myself can tell you disappointed lover waiting at the station and biting his moustache in manner of things the queen of the arena there my dear said soothingly never mind you shall catch your train my footman shall lead your poor horse back to barleyford and you shall jump into the brougham and whisk you to the station before you know where you are come there not moment to lose if you want to catch the train so jump and before you could say jack robinson letty dear had given her poor lame horse into the footman care and charged him to lead it quietly along to the crown he didn half like the job could see pushed into the brougham bade the coachman drive best if tom had been there he have said drive like the old gentleman the station and away we went best pace the bay oss as the coachman persists in calling crusader laying himself down to his work in his very best style well now had had by this time by the way wiped away her tears and looked quite to myself pro ceeded to make much of her poor little thing and told her hoped that some day she would come and pay tom and me visit at the grange to my astonishment she refused firmly indeed that for the moment am bound to confess felt rather queen of the arena she noticed it and taking my hand in hers and looking pleadingly up in my face said don be angry with me please don but really can you little know what am or you would never propose such thing my dear child replied quite taken aback what do you mean am quite sure you are lady and as to your there is no disgrace in woman earning her living that can see any more than man perhaps you are an artist adore artists or an authoress you don know what tremendous am professional singer or musician perhaps worship music though can play bit or sing either though strum bit sometimes just to amuse myself and squall dtcasionally to please my husband no said am none of those dear fernely shaking her head sadly wish then what in the name of fortune are you exclaimed rather impatiently fear for we were not far from the station by this time and was afraid she would get away and me none the wiser you must make heaps of money whatever you are thought to ride the horses you she turned round looked me straight in the face and replied the queen of the arena fernely my name is nelly delorme and they call me the queen of the my dear you could have knocked me down with feather as the saying is was so astonished the queen of the arena gasped out good gracious you don say so am indeed she said so you see can come and see you however much should like to your husband am quite certain would not care to have poor in side his house and you must see yourself it is out of the question can say like it she went on and that you will understand when tell you that am probably of as good birth as yourself but am not ashamed of it for all that there is one thing can say she added draw ing herself up proudly here the tears made their appearance again and that is not soul can breathe word against my fair my dear girl said hugging her to me feel quite sure of that now tell me where do you act or whatever you call it tell me all about it and if you won come and see why must do as mahomet did to the mountain and come and see you tell me quick dear for here we are at the station you find me at smitherini circus in the queen oe the arena lisle street she replied am on every night at nine clock and on saturdays in the afternoon as well at four and now dear fernely and many many thanks for all your and giving me kiss she jumped out of the brougham and was away and into the station before knew she had gone scarcely there said little fernely that my story and now tell me all of you what you think of it think of it exclaimed the squire why that it as good as any novel ever than most in fact and that the sooner the lot of us cut up to town and visit the queen of the arena in her native sawdust the better that what say on the haw capital idea observed major brown twisting his moustachios as he spoke hard time like the why not make it major brown exclaimed his hostess you are positive are indeed had no idea you had it in you why it will be the very thing being saturday there is an afternoon performance too that why you named that day of course thoughtful man look here then ladies and gentlemen she went on addressing the company queen of the arena with regard to major brown suggestion which by the way beg to second would propose is this that we all of us run up to town by the eleven clock train morning lunch at the métropole or the grand go to the circus and return by the seven clock train which will land us back again just in time for very late dinner there that the programme if anyone can propose better let him hold up his or her hand as the case may not single hand being raised the motion was declared duly carried and now said that lady luncheon is ready so come along good people and we drink the queen of the arena very good and as they marched into luncheon edward arden who for some reason or another seemed strangely agitated got hold of fernely and begged her to give him the minutest description possible of her protégée that lively lady laughingly complied at the same time remarking to ned with roguish look should uncommonly like to know arden what you want to know all these par ticulars about girl you ve never set eyes on before for wait until after luncheon and you shall replied ned another romance thought the little lady to herself oh this is too charming the queen of the arena chapter iv snow lay deep on the ground the next morning the country generally looking like an enor mous as lovell remarked at breakfast wonder now if that an omen thought ned arden who had overheard the remark and who superstitious as sailor should be was quite ready to accept the slightest encouragement as regards the one matter that affected him so par ticularly as he had promised he had confided his story to little fernely after luncheon the previous day and the result of it was that they had both come to the conclusion that was ned own lost nelly and no other feel as positive about it exclaimed fernely as if knew it for certain what brave girl too can tell you how long to see the meeting between you by the way arden will you promise me one thing before we part my dear fernely replied the grateful ned there nothing in this world wouldn promise you only give it name what is it the gueen of the arena well it is this was the reply of course there will be wedding and that soon am right am not arden hope so replied ned with blush very well then said fernely promise me that you will be married from my house don disappoint me please for have set my heart upon it besides your nelly has got no home recollect and she must have somewhere to go to so let her come to me and be sister to her if she ll let me promise me arden repeated fernely looking pleadingly into ned face ned gave the required promise with the greatest possible pleasure as may be readily guessed and felt strongly inclined to hug the fair pleader into the bargain bleak and cheerless as the weather was that circumstance did not seem to affect in any way the spirits of the party who nearly filled carriage in the eleven clock express to london that morning the only quiet one among them being edward arden who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to care to join in the chaff and laughter going on around him his lively friends rallied him on his want of spirits at last one lady hazarding the opinion that arden must be in love she little guessed how well she had hit the mark at length after journey which passed like the queen of the arena lightning to the rest of the party but seemed an age to ned the train arrived in london and one of those convenient vehicles private omnibus being in readiness to meet them the whole party were whisked off at once to the hotel métropole as being the nearest point to the circus for the pur pose of luncheon which necessity like the omni bus had been ordered beforehand by telegraph that cheery meal being disposed of the omnibus was once more put into requisition and away drove the party to smitherini circus what state of mind our friend ned was in by this time may well be imagined nor was little fernely much better mind you tell me the moment you see her whether it is her she whispered to ned as she took his arm on alighting at the entrance of the circus won forget you may depend replied ned who was quivering with excitement from head to foot the next moment and they were seated in their places and soon afterwards noisy overture having been inflicted upon them by the orchestra the performance began this part of the enter tainment possessed no attraction for two of the party fernely and edward arden to wit and the marvellous acts of equitation by mademoiselle natalie the stale ones by the way the great little merriman the clown and thethe queen of the arena comical antics of some performing mules passed unheeded by them though greatly appreciated by everybody in the house including their own party and now what is it causes little fernely heart to throb with excitement and edward to turn pale and bite his lips glance at the programme will explain the performing mules have all but concluded their act and the next item is thus announced miss nellydelorme the queen of the arena on her renowned thoroughbred horse the red prince will appear in her daring hunting act as performed before royalty in the course of which she will leap over six gates in suc cession feat never before attempted by any as the mules at the close of their comic business disappeared wave of joyful anticipation seemed to pass through the vast audience like an electric current which was increased as sundry coated retainers of the establishment appeared in the ring each bearing high white gate these being duly placed in position the band struck up the old hunting tune hi ho chevy and every eye in the place was at once turned towards the principal entrance another second and great cry went forth of here she comes and amidst tremendous clapping of hands and waving of handkerchiefs young girl attired in ao the queen of the arena brown habit and mounted on magnificent horse cantered becomingly into the ring gracefully bowing right and left to the repeated plaudits as she halted in the centre of the arena it her it nelly exclaimed ned in whisper to fernely knew it and oh so glad was the reply meanwhile be good boy and moderate your transports dear arden said she laying her hand on the impatient lover arm for ned had half risen from his seat with the evident intention of rushing off wait quietly until she has finished her performance and then we frame an excuse and go to the dear girl at once if she was to catch sight of you now recollect it might upset her and spoil her bad fall of course what an ass was not to think of that replied ned thank you again for your good advice fernely you re wonderful person declare you re right about everything bravo exclaimed lovell delightedly clapping her hands as the queen of the arena and her black horse came to the end of their exhibition and pray where are you and arden off to rose may ask saido the queen of the arena she in the same breath addressing her little friend fernely who with ned had now risen from their seats only going outside for breath of fresh air letty dear replied that lady unblushingly we be back almost in another second they were in the lobby and inquiring of an official the way to the stables judiciously administered procured that worthy personal guidance to the spot few minutes later signor smitherini he spoke remarkably good cockney english for foreigner was considerably astonished when chancing to go in quest of his leading star to say word to her on business before she took her departure he found her reclining in dead faint in the arms of gentleman the while lady of aristocratic appearance and attired as he afterwards observed in the height of fashion was endeavouring to bring her to with the aid of an elaborately chased bottle great was that gentleman chagrin on learning the true state of the case for well he knew nelly departure from his circus meant large in his receipts you allow her to give one farewell perform ance ope sir said he obsequiously to ned arden when nelly having partially recovered the queen of the arena had retired to her with fernely certainly not replied ned decisively not one extremely sorry but it is quite out of the question do assure you any loss you may incur by miss delorme leaving you so abruptly her friends will only be too pleased to make good and that is all that can well that andsome cert nly said the crest fallen manager as it happens her agreement expires this day week so she is free from that day your coming here sir was most unfortu nate thing for me as it turns out for was just the queen of the arena coming to ask her to step round to my room to talk over fresh engagement and sign if possible for another six months at an increased salary when you arrive and spoil all well it can be helped sighed poor signor smitherini we ve always been the best of friends as think she tell you and whilst sorry for my own sake to lose her glad for her own that she as may say to better her self no offence sir trust in making that hobservation not bit replied ned heartily and held out his hand which the signor fer vour three months afterwards little fernely had her wish carried out to the letter for nelly craven and edward arden were married from her house one fine may morning and an uncommonly smart wedding it was too and very looking couple so everybody agreed were the bride and bridegroom there was one guest of the male sex who quite took the shine out of the others and excited great admiration amongst the rustic onlookers by the splendour of his apparel the name of this heavy swell was signor smitherini who had received special invitation under nelly own hand to her wedding his circus still flourishes but the signor has repeatedly been heard to say that since her queen of the arena sion from the business he has never succeeded in finding star who attracted the public like nelly delorme the queen of the uncle èn harles began my wife one night soon after we had retired to rest this really must not go on any longer if your uncle ben jamin continues to lead the dreadful life he is leading he will get rid of all his money and then what will be come of us should like to know you

fussy and he shall get your horrid disreputable old uncle locked up in lunatic asylum and kept there now do you intend to see about it answer me charles at insist you have no right to treat me like this sir and won stand it any longer oh yes you need not snore and make pretence to be asleep because know per fectly well you are now during this delightful ad ministered by my loving spouse had not really been to sleep or anything like it though as she justly remarked had pretended to be by puttinguncle ben in judicious snore occasionally on the contrary as it happened was quite as as she was and oddly enough actually turning over in my mind the very subject on which she was so eloquent all of sudden only was not going to be such fool as to tell her dear no ve not been married all these years not to be fully alive to the fact that once you let the wife of your chest imagine that she is cleverer than you are it is all up with your authority over her no the great thing you may depend is to make your wife think that yours is the not hers that it is you that she is to look to for advice in get her out of scrapes maybe that she is the inferior animal allround in fact well may as well say at once my wife was quite right my uncle benjamin browser was going on for an old one in as eccentric not to say disreputable manner as it was possible to conceive during my aunt eliza lifetime nothing could have been more decorous than my uncle behaviour breakfast at clock bus to the city as regular as again at russell square at at prayers at immediately after now and then this regular life was broken into by little mild dissipation such as uncle ben or visit to the theatre but these were very rare occasions my aunt eliza not encouraging the drama it having tendency in her opinion to corrupt morals generally she was in conse quence extremely difficult to please and she must beforehand be thoroughly convinced that the piece to be performed was absolutely sans raproche before she could be induced to go my uncle would very much have liked to have gone occasionally to the gaiety and would hint as much sometimes on which occasions my aunt would put her foot down as she called it at once where there are legs she would say in that awful voice of hers virtuous shudder at the same moment running through her frame don and then with snap you ought to be aware of that by this time should have occasionally she would add by way of solace if you must go somewhere benjamin there is that delightful entertainment of and german reed at george hall or there is know very charming concert at james hall to either of which should be pleased to accompany at which concession on his wife part poor uncle benjamin would give vent to groan he like everyone else was great admirer of the clever entertainers in question and was fond of music of lighter sort but he would have muchuncle ben preferred legs if he had had his own way in the matter providence not having blessed my uncle and aunt with family it was an understood thing that my uncle benjamin money would eventually come to me and mine my uncle had stood god father to my eldest boy my aunt ditto to two of our girls this was rather bore for of course we had to christen the children after them and if there are two names hate and detest more than any others they are benjamin and eliza naturally therefore the future was looked into by my wife and myself through glasses of the rosiest possible hue when my aunt died many were the conjectures on my wife part as to what my uncle would now do with himself would he live in solitude and save up his money for us ha ha and eventually pine away and die or would he as have known some dejected mortals do before now when his period of mourning was over launch out into life of fun and to go it in short as that popular comedian toole would say we were not long left in suspense for the space of twelve months uncle benjamin behaved himself with the utmost decorum and went to church more frequently than ever he in short deported himself generally in way that excited the admiration of everybody with whom he came uncle ben into contact including numerous single ladies every one of whom would have been only too happy to have filled the place so lately vacated by my aunt eliza and then grieve to have to record uncle ben casting aside his grief and his sombre garments at one and the same time emerged from his solitude and at once proceeded to go it in most alarming fashion by jove he did go it can tell you there was no sort of amusement really believe that that wicked old man did not have shy at and my wife and fairly trembled for the future the first thing the dear old gentleman did was to sell his share of the business in wood street cheapside to his partner for goodly sum with no chick nor child who have got to work for now she is gone he said to me when having told me of what he had done observed that in my opinion he had made mistake did not like to say so but had it on the tip of my tongue to exclaim you have got me and mine sir me your nephew with five children each one more hungry than the other and prob ably more coming who can tell the accounts we heard of uncle ben doings from time to time were positively heartrending big dinners at richmond and greenwich at which the company were not all gentlemen constant attendant at kempton park and ben down conspicuous first nighter at the theatres and regular frequenter of the halls his name only knows with what that of miss popsy tre maine of the hilar ity and finally this was the last quite name for himself as prominent patron of the amongst the members of which profession he was familiarly known as uncle oh it was enough to make his venerable father the founder of the famous house of turn in his grave with horror it was indeed as for us living as we did in quiet village in the heart of the country do you think we were ever honoured with visit from our venerable uncle ben relative now oh dear no in aunt eliza time the pair of them were only too delighted to stay with us for bit but things were all altered were far too slow for such young fellow as our sexagenarian relative don fancy the old boy did himself much harm racing for think he went to meeting entirely for the fun of the thing but his sudden and unaccountable penchant dor prize fighting confess did not like at all indeed was warned that he was not only squandering large sums of money upon it but was likely to get rid of good deal more before he had done unless stop was put to it my friend hopkins regular man about town and on whose word could rely wrote me as follows if this jolly old uncle of yours only confined himself to visiting the and looking on at the sparring it would be all right but notuncle ben content with that he must needs like paul dombey friend toots get hold of pugilist all to himself whom he has taken under his special wing as it were and goes about with on all occasions this fellow dreadful ruffian named bill barney alias the nobby un sticks to him like leech and no doubt bleeds him in proportion know for fact that he gets large sums of money out of him on pretence of having rescued him from imaginary robbers and dodges here is an example your uncle walking home to his rooms in john street after festive evening somewhere or another is suddenlypounced upon by couple of fellows who emerge from dark corner and demand his money with all sorts of menaces threatening him unless he stumps up with all manner of violence they are just pro ceeding to of them indeed by way of bringing the old gentleman up has just given him preliminary tap on the there suddenly arrives upon the scene the brave william barney who hitting out or pretending to left quickly puts uncle ned two assailants to flight and escorts him home in safety needless to say the latter is uncommonly grateful vows that the nobby un has saved his life and gives him cheque proportionate to his services take my advice old fellow wound up my friend get the old idiot out of this as soon as uncle ben possible or else this gang who have got hold of him will pluck him until he hasn got feather left to fly with don know how true it few nights ago they got him on to blind hookey and had five hundred out of him before you could say knife if can assist in any way pray command me yours truly fred this letter of fred to use slang expression made me sit up bit and was turning it over in my mind in bed and thinking what was to be done at the same moment that my clever her heart doing her level best to make night hideous with her one thing was certain something must be done and that quickly to choke uncle ben off this mad hobby of his once and for all and am glad to say that before went to sleep that night had devised scheme for my uncle benefit which if properly carried out would in all probability thoroughly effect its purpose accordingly immediately after breakfast the following morning shut myself into the apart ment the servants call master study and which usually term the and lighting large cigar instead of my usual pipe sat down and concocted with considerable care the following letter uncle ben woodleigh november th my dear uncle are so very quiet down here as rule that under ordinary circumstances should hardly have dared to invite you to pay us visit however venture with some confidence to do so now having great notion that shall be in position to afford you some amusement you are know and am proud to know staunch patron of in my humble opinion that manliest of all our english sports and pastimes the noble art of what can be finer sight or one more calculated to fill the bosom of an englishman with pride than that of two stalwart specimens of the race each striving for supremacy within the arena in other words the plaudits of hundreds perhaps thousands of their countrymen think can hear you exclaiming as you peruse this what indeed think it is the duty of every englishman to encourage and foster the noble art in every possible way for there is no doubt that proficiency in the use of nature plain english to be able to use one dukes well great way towards doing away with the cowardly use of the knife and murderous weapons so much in vogue in other countries with this object in view few friends and myself have arranged little match between two novices from this neighbourhood for purse uncle ben subscribed for amongst ourselves the two combatants have been in training for the last six weeks and as both are good men and thoroughly game we may anticipate with confidence the merriest of one of my the principal in inviting you to come and witness the contest is that we are much in want of some sportsman of unimpeachable integrity who is thoroughly conversent with the to officiate as referee make no excuse for asking you to take this perhaps unenviable office on your shoulders in the full knowledge that can think of no one so capable as yourself to undertake the duty if can induce you to consent and indeed all concerned shall be deeply grateful need scarcely impress upon you the absolute necessity for keeping the little affair as dark as possible as if it was to get wind not only would there be danger of police interference and they are excessively zealous in these parts but it would certainly cause the rough element to put in an appearance in large numbers at the an event which am sure you will agree would be decidedly incompatible with our personal comfort may ask you therefore as particular favour not to mention the affair to living all to any professional pugilist no matter how great your faith in him the projected fight ben to come off next thursday week that ever is we having fixed upon splendid piece of ground on slopperton common some few miles from here any day you like to come will suit me can only add the sooner the better with best love from my wife and the children believe me my dear uncle your very affectionate nephew charles plausible benjamin browser and having popped this precious mass of lies into its envelope gummed it down and stamped it went out to find my wife and report pro gress and shortly after sat down to luncheon feeling that had done very good morning work by return of post came uncle ben reply thus it ran john street berkeley square november nth my dear charles me on monday evening next by the express from town would have come before dear boy but for the fact that have little dinner on on the sunday few theatrical folk don you you old rascal thought wouldn miss the mill for any amount of money for though have itnclf witnessed many turn with the gloves ve never yet seen the real thing shall have very much pleasure in officiating as referee say it that shouldn don know where you find one better fitted for the post than myself am quite with you also as to keeping the affair if possible eh and as far as am concerned it is case of mum the word and no mistake love to laura and the dear children and believe me your affectionate uncle benjamin certain rough but honest creature who looks after me whenever go the rounds is very anxious to know where am off to told him was going to auncle ben funeral and asked him if he would like to come too oddly enough he declined ha ha hurrah exclaimed addressing my wife and throwing the letter over for her to read that all old reprobate coming off my love to make all the necessary arrangements ha fight so you won see me again until in all tell me what you re going to do charles dear won you pleaded my wife as prepared to leave the room all right my charmer you shall know when the time comes replied gaily how inquisitive the women are to be sure uncle ben arrived on the monday and the fight and nothing but the fight was the theme of our conversation during the time that inter vened you never saw an elderly sportsman so keen he talked bless you of smashers on the point of the jaw and other pugilistic terms as if to the manner born on the eve of the great event we were to have composed entirely of men my wife spending the evening at the vicarage so as not to be in the way at two in the morning my uncle and were to uncle ben start in the dogcart for my friend banbury five miles off where we were to breakfast and from thence walk to the scene of the encounter which was close by what dinner it was and you should have heard uncle ben proposing with many hiccups the toast of the noble art of then proposed his health as the guest of the evening in rising to respond to which the jolly old gentleman tumbled under the table and was promptly conveyed to bed at proceeded to rouse my uncle from his easy task can assure you at last with the aid of bottle of soda water got him to understand that it was time for start and he proceeded to struggle into his clothes half asleep we hoisted him into the dogcart and away we drove into the darkness such morning as it was raw and cold and drizzling rain falling at last we pulled up at banbury and very acceptable was his comfortable with its blazing fire after our cold drive can tell none more so than my uncle who stood blinking and winking like an owl his teeth chattering with the cold like pair of castanets twos and threes the other conspirators arrived and shortly after in came the servants with soups savoury grills and devils and all manner of good things to enable us to face theuncle ben elements pop went the and clatter clatter went the knives and forks early rising evidently agreed with us my uncle too who by this time had just got over the effects of the wine at dinner pegged away as heartily as any of us he was evidently popular character for every soul in the room kept asking him to take wine with them my host at last with wink at me suggested tnat if we had all done we had better be off lo and behold though my uncle is on his legs hurrah speech he couldn allow us to hiccup he said without giving ush hie toast the noble art of hiccup was glorious institooshun and should be who wash that hie laughed hic cup suddenly exclaimed my uncle looking fiercely round the delinquent was young frank lovel who was leaning back in his chair in fits of laughter my uncle fixing him with glaring eye stag gered round the table and aiming blow at frank now helpless with laughter lost his balance and fell upsetting his opponent in so doing chair and all well uncle said cheerily as entered my relative bedroom by his request at noon the following day and how are you capital fight wasn it uncle ben thousand pities it not that poor chap was so hurt they say he will die that the worst of it however we must hope for the best the worst of it is went on quite regardless of my uncle horrified countenance the worst of it is that if anything does happen they ll be down upon you for being referee it was pity too you were so dreadfully abusive to the chief constable when he turned up lord how aston ished he looked when you threatened to land him one on the and if that wasn enough you spoil his boko for him he so proud of his nose too good god exclaimed my wretched uncle sitting bolt upright in bed his eyes nearly start ing out of his head with excitement and fear combined am gone mad charles for don remember single thing about it can call to mind single circumstance in connection with the give you my sacred word can charles my dear boy send for the doctor at once for must be going feel am and my wretched uncle sank back on his pillow quite exhausted and rushed hastily from the room to give way to my own emotion oh the sight of his face shall ever forget it the doctor to whom you may be sure impar ted the secret arrived in due course and having adminisftred soothing draught his patient wasuncle ben soon himself again and two days after was well enough to return to town am pleased to be able to state that my ruse was completely successful for the result of it was that my uncle acquired thorough dislike to pugilism he severed his acquaintance with bill barney alias the nobby un much to that per son disgust and bade to the prize ring and all in connection with it for evermore uncle ben is still under the firm impression that he actually attended the fight was sup posed to get up for him and if you ask him will give you most graphic account of it he invariably winds up his story thus and can tell you what was very nearly getting into serious scrape over that little affair being caught by the police acting as referee was bad enough but when losing my temper was fool enough to threaten to land the chief con stable of the county one on the boko it became beyond joke what new way to pay old the damsel delight and the chaperone fear he is voted trump amongst men his father allows him three hundred year and he lay you thousand to ddy low his chris tian name was george but every body called him doddy lieu tenant in the th hussars besides being voted by common consent the and youngster in the regiment was far and away the fastest and most extravagant man in it and seeing that the gallant corps in question was by no manner of means the slowest in the service that meant good deal you may depend how on earth he managed to do all he did on new way to pay old debts the small allowance his father made three hundred perfect enigma to everybody who knew him there were several wealthy men in the regiment perfect crcesus in comparison to doddy yet he not only managed to keep pace with them all but rode and drove better horses kept smarter servants and betted more heavily than any one of them the question one and all asked was how does he do it he himself when questioned on the subject would reply in his usual airy frolicsome manner that having long been convinced that the one great secret of success in this world was never to part he had determined to follow it out most religiously for instance said he when confounded dun gets me into corner don promise him windsor castle but never part by any chance why bless your innocent hearts should be in week if played that sort of silly game waiter get me well doddy maxim as laid down by himself went on successfully for while but the worm will turn and in like manner in process of time poor doddy creditors began to think amongst themselves that the capting promises were like piecrust made to be broken new way to pay old debts and as consequence began to make themselves extremely unpleasant in many ways to that light hearted sabreur to make things worse the regiment was under orders for india and this circumstance naturally made those gentry more pressing in their attentions than ever not that doddy was in the least put out what idiots they are he would say as he lit cigar with peremptory epistle from some tradesman they ought to know by this time that they can not get blood out of stone but they will keep on bothering just the the same hang em actually got letter from cox yesterday telling me had over drawn always thought bankers liked one to correct thing to do in short told em when wrote to put things doddy notion of putting things straight at his bankers turned out to be sending them cheque on themselves well the upshot of it all was that the colonel was so pestered by his extravagant subaltern creditors that at last he could stand it no longer but sent for doddy and told that young gentle man plainly that if he wanted to remain in the regiment he must settle his debts before they left for india impecunious doddy gravely assured his chiefo new way to pay old debts that this should be done without fail and bowing left the room the day before the ship sailed for india doddy with an extra large cigar what he was pleased to call roofer his mouth in glass the size of aa new way to pay old debts stable bucket at his elbow and bran new cheque book of gigantic dimensions in front of him sat himself down at his table for the express purpose of keeping faith with his colonel and settling up with his credi tors there were exactly of them little and big and to each of these did doddy send cheque on his bankers for the amount owing there exclaimed he with an air of satisfac tion as he gummed down the last envelope of the batch that welief to my mind getting wid of all those wapacious wascals after all he added philosophically the colonel was quite wight it was the only thing to do for the future said doddy grandly addressing circle of admiring friends shall go on the operwative pwinciple and pay weady money for everwything oh yes you fellows may laugh but it comes much cheaper in the end well the wegiment as doddy called it ar rived in due course in india and shortly after his arrival our friend received the expected letters of acknowledgment from the creditors to each of whom he had so generously forwarded cheque curiously enough they none of them contained receipt and one and all were written as nearly new way to pay old debts as possible in the same words the following being specimen new bond street london august dear sir are in receipt of your letter of the enclosing cheque for account rendered on examination of the same however we find that you have accidentally omitted your signa ture we herewith therefore return the draft in question in order that you may rectify the omission apologising for thus troubling you we beg to remain dear sir your obedient servants creale binman to lieutenant brownlow th and when doddy who was lying comfortably on his back in his bungalow with large manilla cigar in his mouth and glass of by his side had read them all one after another he collected all of them into bundle presented them to the indian who wasa new way to pay old debts working the punkah and who received them with salaam and grin as if he quite entered into the spirit of the thing and then and not till then he threw his curly head back and roared with laughter black sheep of the filacli sbxcp of tljc jfamiln chapter dear georgiana exclaimed the elder miss coe as her sister entered the break fast parlour of their little house at dullchester one fine summer morning my dear georgiana who do you think have just received letter from indeed really can not guess elizabeth replied miss georgiana rather frostily for in the first place she did not feel particularly well on that identical morning and in the second if there was one thing in this world miss georgiana detested more than another it was being asked to guess anything in the shape of riddle the black sheep it was remarkable fact that whenever miss elizabeth felt perfectly well in herself and in con sequence bright and cheerful and in love with all the world it invariably happened that her sister would feel exactly the contrary and vice versa there was no doubt about it that on this identical morning miss georgiana felt extremely cross and pettish as the old saying is she had got out of bed the wrong the more crusty and disagreeable she was the more sprightly and amiable was her skittish in fact the sight of her quite aggravated miss georgiana but to return to miss elizabeth and her letter knew that you would never guess said she in triumphant tone of same triumphant tone that she always assumed when she had just made an extraordinary never was such woman for making bargains as miss found something detri mental to the character of someone belonging to her own sex to whom she had taken dislike in the latter case she was positively appalling in her hour of victory the look of withering scorn that would come over her face when she mentioned the name of the object of her abhor rence the cavalry tone with which she would exclaim told you so or now appeal to everybody did not say so all along were not to be forgotten in hurry by theof the family spectator knew she repeated that you would never oh dear me snapped her sister with stamp of her foot who is it from why on earth can you say at once elizabeth instead of beating about the bush so my dear georgiana replied miss elizabeth inherplacidest consequently her most aggravating manner why so touchy of course will tell you you haven given me time yet the black sheep stuff and nonsense murmured her sister would have told you am sure at first but that wanted to give you pleasant little surprise the letter continued elizabeth in an injured tone of voice is from jack our dear brother jack fancy that georgiana he writes in the most affectionate loving manner the dear fellow says that his health is vastly improved for his trip to the riviera in the spring that since then the hard work he has been doing has rather thrown him back and his doctor in con sequence has expressly ordered him to give himself rest for while and to go right away from the noise and turmoil of town and do nothing in the country for while he writes thus said miss elizabeth adjusting her pince nez and reading when it came my dear sister to answering the important question of where shall go to it struck me that could not do better than write and ask you and dear georgiana to give me shelter for whilejunder your roof the quiet peaceful life know you lead at roseleaf cottage will be the very thing for me shall be enabled to forget my briefs for while and consequently get rid of the which is now telling upon me exclaimed her sister parentheti cally what terrible word of the family complete repose is what want the doctor says and that know shall get with you best love to georgiana and yourself and believe me your affectionate brother john hartiboy has just struck me that about this period of the year you and georgiana generally go away to the seaside should this be the case just now pray do not put off any arrangements you may have made on my account with my books and your piano for company still keep up my music find it such solace at times can make myself quite cosy and comfortable in your absence never fear that is if you are not afraid of leaving your house in the charge of such careless rascal as myself by the way at the request of several friends of mine at the bar went through the ordeal the other day of being photographed in my wig and gown and now send the one for you and one for there said miss elizabeth folding the missive up with much complacency if that isn charming letter don know what is people were fond of calling poor jack from his earliest childhood the black sheep of the family and possibly he may at one period of his existence the black sheep have deserved it it is easy to discern however by the tone of his letter that our dear brother has altogether altered his mode of living is quite changed man in fact feel convinced of it most young men grow fine crop of wild oats in the earlier years of their life and the of whom jack is evidently process of time sow them others of course do not his photographs alone do look at them georgiana would tell people what he is what good expression he has what firmness about the mouth what eloquence in the eyes can fancy exclaimed miss jellicoe in one of her bursts of enthusiasm the most hardened criminal that ever existed quailing in the dock when our brother rises in his place in his wig and gown to address the jury and now said she as she sat down at the end of the table and proceeded to pour out the tea the next thing to do of course is to write and tell dear jack to come at once it is unfor we are engaged to go to the timmins next thursday but don see very well either how we can get off how ever said she brightening up if he comes we shall have him with us for week clear and we must hope that when we return at the end of our visit we shall still find him here dear fellow we must see that he is not dull georgiana during our absence uncle josephof the family must come and chat with him he usually has an hour or so for his disposal know in the after noon before he goes to the uncle joseph brother of the misses jellicoe late mother filled the important post of county treasurer and fancy was thereby in his own opinion at least person of much con sequence he lived at pretty place called noke lodge some ten miles off and came back wards and forwards to chester every day by train dear sopp too continued miss jellicoe am sure will call he smokes think have heard him say so he and jack will no doubt get on com fortably together don you think so georgiana observed miss georgiana with con temptuous sort of sniff as she seated herself at the table have my doubts about that sister for as you ought to know by this time the black sheep jack and his uncle never could agree and never will in all probability and as for poor sopp his views on things in general would naturally be so totally at variance with jack that in my opinion it would really be the height of absurdity to try and bring them well well replied her sister resignedly then there is nothing for it suppose but for jack to amuse himself as best he can until we return from our visit to the timmins anyhow she continued as she gathered up her letters and things and rose from the table will send dear ack telegram at once and say how delighted we shall be to see him as soon as ever he likes to come suppose you have nothing to say against that georgiana said miss elizabeth by way of parting shot as she prepared to leave the room oh dear no replied her sister so long as john behaves himself decorously miss georgiana always called her brother john when put out about anything am always pleased to see him don suppose however he will for single moment you recollect his last visit suppose elizabeth oh pooh replied her sister with toss of her head that was five years ago jack is altogether changed since that besides you must remember georgiana that he is jellicoe and the jellicoes never were like anybody else of the family chapter ii hat all right exclaimed in joyous tone of voice john jellicoe looking young man of somewhat dissipated appearance as sitting over late breakfast in his cham bers in pump court in the temple he tore open and perused telegram just put into his hands by the sharp london sparrow whom it pleased him to speak of in conversation as my clerk pretty conceit of his seeing that the business of the said clerk consisted in the main in blacking his master boots brushing his clothes waiting at table say ing at home or not at home as the case might be to the numerous visitors to his chambers both male and female and keeping at bay the duns who were apt at times to be more pressing in their attentions than was compatible with jellicoe personal comfort his master was immensely proud of spadger as he called him he can make as well as can myself and will look you straight in the face and tell lie better than any boy in london and what the black sheep higher praise can give him than that should like to know he would ask his friends the telegram that jellicoe had just opened and perused with so much satisfaction proved to be from his sister miss elizabeth jellicoe at chester with whom the reader has already become acquainted and ran thus delighted to see you come if pos sible as we are on the point of going away for fortnight on spadger shouted john jellicoe yessir replied that youngster running in from the adjoining room where he was busy brushing some clothes get me out the curaçoa and then run to the nearest office with this telegram one as he and when you have done that get the portmanteaus out want you to do some packing am going away for three weeks or yessir said spadger standing at attention please am to go too added he looking wistfully into his master face as the latter handed him the telegram go too well no don think shall want you this time so you have to stop here and answer the door you won be dull and there are sure to be lot of duns for you to the family cise your talents in the lying way upon during my absence replied his master should like to sir wery much should day in the country be wery benefishul to my constitooshun just now sir urged the disap pointed spadger well ll think over it said his master meanwhile look sharp with that telegram you have and come back directly mind and don go loitering about as you generally do looking at the shops or lick you like sack wery good sir replied the boy seizing the telegram and running downstairs three steps at time whistling loudly as he went he returned in an incredibly short space of time and was much gratified at his master in forming him that he had decided on taking him with him some doubts having arisen in that gentleman mind as to whether his boots would be properly blacked at his sisters establishment and he was as spadger was wont to say hawful pertickler about his and said john jellicoe mind you don get cheeking the other servants or getting drunk or anything of that sort you little devil you or you get the sack and in time too my sisters where we are going won stand any of that sort of nonsense can tell you wery good sir replied spadger putting on most innocent expression and retiring with the the black sheep breakfast things to the solitude of the pantry where he proceeded to relieve his feelings by indulging in sundry pantomimic gestures expres sive of much inward satisfaction six clock that evening saw master and man safely landed on the platform at dullchester and as there was plenty of time before dinner the black sheep of the family decided to walk to roseleaf cottage sending spadger on in advance in fly with the luggage and pray who may you be you lazy littleof the family monkey inquired miss georgiana still in rather captious mood addressing spadger and eyeing that unabashed youth with much distrust as he stood in an easy attitude with his hands in his and straw in his mouth looking on in the most unconcerned manner whilst the maidservant and the flyman between them lugged his master luggage into the house who am mum replied spadger swelling with indignation at being so addressed why mister jellicoe confidenshul walet to be sure confidenshul muttered the boy to himself with chuckle should rayther think was confi denshul indeed why don know wot the guv nor would do without me blessed if do the black sheep chapter iii lizabeth said miss georgiana jellicoe addressing her elder sister as they were leaving the one morning within day or two of the termination of their visit to their friends the timmins at honeywood hall must have word with you at once in private let us seek the privacy of the garden have begun miss georgiana in sepulchral tone of voice as soon as they had reached the shrubbery this morning received two of the most most letters it is possible to conceive thanks to jack elizabeth we shall never be able to show our face at dullchester again that is very certain warned you you will recollect at the time but you would insist on asking him down and we must now take the consequences of our folly he was reformed character you said reformed he is indeed good heavens me exclaimed poor miss elizabeth declare georgiana you have made me all of tremble what on earth is the matter do for goodness sake tell me at once of the family ôi oh wish had my with me feel sure you are going to tell me something to upset me oh my poor nerves can stand can georgiana must go back to the house at stuff and nonsense said miss georgiana unfeelingly insist on your staying whilst read these dreadful letters one is from uncle joseph the other rev sopp will read uncle joseph first now listen to this dullchester monday dear georgiana ventured to sug gest short time ago that in asking that respectable brother of yours to come and stay at roseleaf cottage you were making very great mis take was as good as told by your sister elizabeth in that polite manner she always puts on to me to mind my own business consequently prefer to write to you and leave you to judge when you have read my letter whether my advice to you with regard to your brother john was good or whether it was not he had long ago given up all his old pursuits such as racing gambling you assured me and was now reading steadily for the bar as regards the first can only reply has he and as to his going to the bar should say the only bar at which he is ever likely to take prominent position is an hotel the black sheep or more probable still if he goes on much longer as he is now doing the bar at the old bailey this is very certain he has made name for himself with vengeance during his stay in our ancient city such trifles as poking fun at the dean and playing disgraceful practical joke on poor old simpson one of the best known and most respected men in the place were bad enough but when it came to his being the prime mover in bringing down horde of murdering ruffians from london for the express purpose of indulging in the brutal amusement of there is nothing more to be said the only excuse for him that can find is that as your sister is so fond of saying jack is jellicoe every inch of for once she is absolutely correct he has succeeded to perfection in doubt to congenial task of keeping up the family reputa tion and adding fresh lustre to its long roll shall say great deeds the fight duly came off on crawley down and most disgraceful scene it seems to have been one of the combatants whose principal backer by the way was your delightful brother being all but killed the police appeared just in time to save the poor wretch life and not quite in time to arrestof the family john jellicoe who disappeared at once and has not been seen since the unfortunate is at this moment in the county hospital from whence he will be removed to gaol where in all probability your brother will be keeping him company before long warrant having been issued for his appre hension together with the other principals who ever they are sincerely hope they will all be caught and justice meted out to them with unsparing hand need scarcely tell you that this disgraceful conduct on the part of your brother has to certain extent affected your own good name in dullchester you can touch pitch without being defiled you know some malicious per sons have even spread about report that you and elizabeth went away for while pur posely in order to give your brother freer play to bring off his brutal this of course has made me very angry as doubt it will you and strongly advise you therefore to return at once so that you can personally con tradict the canard all people of course know per fectly well that you are both quite innocent in the matter indeed have heard the strongest possible expressions of sympathy from nearly everyone of your acquaintance you would have had mine as well under the black sheep ordinary circumstances but seeing that warned you all along what the consequences would prob ably be if you ever let your scamp of brother again inside your house confess am not sorry for you one bit your aunt sends her love with mine remain your affectionate uncle joseph there elizabeth said miss georgiana when the letter came to an end what do you think of that hope you are proud of your favourite jack to think that we have lived all these years at dullchester respected believe by everyone with whom we came into contact and then to have our good name trampled in the mud by our own brother oh it is too disgraceful it was all your doing elizabeth whimpered miss georgiana for as uncle joseph says in his letter he warned you all along and so did you can not deny know you can not and now she continued perhaps you would like to hear what dear sopp has to say bother sopp exclaimed miss elizabeth stamping her foot can bear the man georgiana both he and uncle joseph hate and detest poor jack and believe they have pur posely exaggerated the whole affair sopp has got no earthly business to meddle with ourof the family affairs and consider it exceedingly impertinent of him to write to you at all as shall tell him to his face the very first time see him am quite ready to go back to dullchester as soon as ever you sooner the better indeed and arrived there shall make point of showing myself in public as much as possible jellicoe afraid of the opinion of such people as uncle joseph who never as you know has good word to say for sopp what next indeed and the indignant miss elizabeth having thus spoken her mind turned on her heel and with contemptuous toss of her head walked off to the house leaving her sister speechless with horror and amazement bravo miss elizabeth say we the following letter from john jellicoe to his friend and frank somerville written just about this period will possibly explain what actually took place better than any words of ours king bench walk july dear frank promised to give you an account of my doings at dullchester so here goes have just got back from that slowest of towns and as you prophesied before you went the black sheep away have succeeded in making the place too hot to hold me any longer what my sisters will say to it all when they come back don know bless their old hearts the first thing did to distinguish myself was week after my arrival in the place winning fifty pounds from an old ass named simpson great man in the club here and much respected as they say it was the talk the town can tell you my boy old simpson must tell you fancies himself at billiards most himself second john roberts really believe the stupid old fool when gave him twenty out of hundred and beat his head off the very first day was put down for the club the old gent conceived violent dislike to yours truly from that moment and lost no opportunity of abusing me like my back of course our quarrel was great source of amuse ment to the members of the club generally doesn take much to amuse people in place like dullchester as you may imagine there was always kind friend ready to repeat to me the things the old idiot was good enough to say of me do you know that fellow jellicoe temporaryof the family member friend of timmins inquired little bob trippit the most mischievous little beggar in the club one day in the most innocent manner in the world know him sir certainly not roared simpson know him indeed he snorted why wouldn be seen going to with him much less know him now this remark rather nettled me and determined if possible to have my revenge and that quickly accordingly that night thought the matter out carefully and over quiet cigar when reached home arranged my plan of action for the morrow before went to bed had got it all worked out as pat as possible the following afternoon after lunch down marched to the club as usual and having first of all taken bob tripptt into my confidence entered the prepared to do battle with mine enemy there he was as usual as large as life and on extra good terms with himself for he had just succeeded in taking the whole pool mornin simpson said in my cheeriest manner mornin growled he in response have game at billiards went on in casual sort of way taking up cue as spoke and begin ning to knock the balls give you forty the black sheep out of hundred and play you for pony if you like added never play for money sir he answered surlily getting red in the face with anger for the whole room full one was in titter by the way simpson went on before leave this delightful place want to do the cathedral and all that sort of thing don you know am told you know more about it than anyone want to know if you ll take me under your wing morning and show me about take it most kind of you if you certainly not sir roared the now thoroughly roused british lion am not siserony sir cicerone suppose you mean said with wink at the company but simpson went on joking apart do hope you come shall lose ten pounds if you don for bob trippit betted me that sum you would decline and took him on the spot simpson reasoned is one of the creatures under the sun and feel sure will never refuse me especially when he knows have money depending on the event come now simpson say you do as wish do nothing of the kind sir roared the old fellow rising from his seat like an angry if you choose to make foolish bets you must take the you really won said the family no won sir yes you will said quietly be if do he shouted amidst roars of laughter all round the room pretending to be much disappointed left the room on pretence of going to write letter now came bob trippit part in the pro gramme no sooner was out of the room than he began at the old gentleman afresh awfully obliged to you simpson said he you ve put tenner in my pocket that have growled the old gentleman who detested trippit because he was always poking fun at him don make too sure of that not certain that sha do as jellicoe requested me if only out of regard for his sisters whom have the greatest possible respect greatest possible respect for besides which don wish to appear churlish especially to stranger yes on second thought shall is if he asks me bet you level fifty you don sneered bob simpson shook his head hundred to fifty then said bob by jove sir ll take you shouted simpson excitedly you are all of you wit nesses said he appealing to the room generally the black sheep trippit bets me hundred pounds to fifty that don escort young jellicoe to all the places of interest in the city morning is that correct trippit right you are replied bob start from here say at eleven go down the high street look at queen eleanor cross then round the close do the cathedral then on to the museum and then back here to lunch that the pro gramme and now go and fetch jellicoe he may refuse to come in which case the bet off but think he come as know he is anxious to see heverythink as old middlewick would so saying bob joined me in the and having carefully shut the door we both in dulged in an immoderate fit of laughter went back to the where was immediately tackled by now all smiles for the old humbug was in blue funk lest should cry off and thereby prevent his landing good thing there was nothing he liked so much as betting on nearly certainty we both knew he was always indeed making thought out before entering the club house you may depend said he when we parted company eleven clock sharp mind and we spend pleasant morning amongst the lions eh ha ha of the family and away he went chuckling to himself all down the high street you should just have seen his face and his start of horror when trippit calling him out the next morning he saw me waiting for him outside in the garb of brushes and all it an imposition and fraud he shouted appeal to the members of the club but the said members couldn speak for laughing and he could get no satisfaction from any of them he was mean old rascal too and had won money from them so often that they were the black sheep delighted at seeing him caught in the trap the more he gesticulated the more they laughed at last goaded to desperation he declared his intention of winning his bet at all hazards come on sir said he to me come on and actually taking my arm in the excitement of the moment away we went with crowd after you should have seen us striding along the high street people running out of the shops to look at us where do you want to go to first sir gasped poor old simpson the cathedral said choking with laughter come on sir come on this way sir we turned into the close and was just wondering what the vergers and people would think of us when my guide suddenly stopped short good heavens he gasped out it the dean and sure enough not hundred yards off was to be seen the portly figure of the dean approach ing with measured tread reading book as he walked along poor old simpson waited for no more but casting at me an indescribable can call it hatred that shall not forget if live to be hundred and muttering hearty the black sheep benediction let go my arm and ran away as fast as ever his legs would carry him much to the astonishment of his reverence the dean who stood staring in amazement wondering as well he might what on earth it all meant as for me made the best of my way home to change my unsavoury garments after which repaired to the club and made one of particularly festive assembled together to celebrate the event our victim sent cheque to tommy trippit in the course of the afternoon which cheque we carefully divided saw simpson no more during my stay in dullchester it was reported indeed that he had taken to his bed so disgusted was he with the whole proceeding of course the little affair was very quickly all over the town and under the head of practical joke appeared with sundry additions in the columns of the dampshire chronicle and dullchester advertiser altogether made quite name for myself hardly had the excitement cooled down over this little affair than woke em up with another yes dear boy we brought off the mill between bill buster and tom the tinman in which you know took such an interest in style picked out the spot for em crawley down where the fight came off is aboutof the family eight miles from here on the borders of two counties as very well knew so that if the bobbies did interfere we had nothing to do but to shift our ground and laugh at em we all got into couple of hired for the occasion and drove to the spot as comfortably as possible buster won by the skin of his teeth and landed five hundred unfortunately he all but settled tom the tinman and the bobbies coming down in force before we could get the latter away we were obliged to leave him to their tender mercies he is now in the hospital under poleece supervishun as your friend spadger whom have left behind me writes me word only hope he won die meanwhile warrant is out for not only bill buster and the seconds but for yours truly as well awkward ain it am in consequence off to boulong to night and there put up at the hôtel de paris which address will find me until tommy trippit writes me word that it is all tommy must tell you is cousin of the dean of chester wife so if anybody can square the matter he will no more now from yours ever john the black sheep the black sheep of the family had indeed managed to keep up the family reputation during his stay in dullchester as his sisters found to their sorrow on their return and the expressions of pity they got from the numerous callers at roseleaf cottage nearly drove poor miss elizabeth mad john and spadger too had managed somehow during their stay to totally demoralise the interior economy of the establishment mary anne the had during the sisters absence acquired taste for ribbons of fancy character and had become flighty in her demeanour things that miss georgiana could not and would not brook the cook too was discovered in liquor one fine night circumstance that had never happened before when remon strated with by the sisters she burst into tears and producing letter from her pocket kissed it with much emotion calling wildly as she did so on her blessed blessed spadger to come to her old enough to be his grandmother too as the now thoroughly disgusted miss georgiana observed as she returned to the after giving cook month notice the two ladies indeed were thoroughly put out with everything and everybody uncle joseph arriving brimful of abuse of john was tackled to such tune by the angry miss elizabethof the family that he was forced to retreat in the wildest disorder finally the rev joseph sopp thinking to take advantage of her brother indiscretions to work on miss georgiana feelings and induce her to marry him was sent about his business to use an expression common enough amongst the vulgar with flea in his it will be long time we fear before the black sheep of the family and his familiar spirit spadger get another invitation to roseleaf cottage as miss elizabeth is fond of remarking with sigh dear john is such jellicoe you know game to the last same ta tlje tale of the turf many years past more indeed than care to remember has been my invariable custom as christmas time comes round to pack up my traps and repair to off shire in order to spend the festive season in company with my dear old friend and school fellow roger blake and should say no two people in this world were ever better suited to spend christmas together than the pair of us to begin with we are both bachelors and so far as know likely to continue so each of us have the same tastes in common with each other to remarkable degree roger favourite dinner is rumpsteak and oyster sauce with boiled game to the last to follow my favourite dinner is rumpsteak and oyster sauce with boiled to follow roger swears by port wine swear by port wine roger solaces him self after his day work is done with music do the same the only difference in our mode of action being that his instrument is the violin mine the violoncello finally we have both been so to speak com parative failures in the battle of life no it can not be said that either of us have what is called got on in the roger blake though as he says turning sixty is still only the parish doctor john jones at the same age or just about am what have been for the last twenty years managing clerk to messrs grooby pluckem and pyke the solicitors of lincoln inn fields stay when mentioned just now that roger blake and were one as to our likes and dislikes was not strictly accurate for in one respect our tastes most certainly differ and in this way whereas cockney bred and born pine for green fields and all the delights of rural life roger who has not been up to london dozen times since he walked the hospitals as lad is always talking with sigh of the pleasures of the nothing pleases him better indeed than to refer back to those halcyon days when he was student at guy though it must be yearsgame to the last since he visited theatre he keeps himself posted through the medium of the newspapers with all the latest information respecting the stage and all pertaining to it and knows far more about it than living on the spot do that is certain it is very funny when you come to think of it we two old fellows sitting over our pipes and grog of night each riding our respective hobbies he we ll say criticising the last new play at the lyceum which he has never seen and probably never will enlarging on the superiority of this over that am great upholder of the sport of kings though rarely go to race game to the last and never bet or the meets of lord pack of foxhounds verily believe for the moment that we are both under the impression that we are thoroughly well up in all we are talking about knowing roger penchant for theatrical gossip of all sorts make it my business sometime before starting for my annual christmas visit to my friend to collect all the latest anent the profession expressly for his benefit whilst he like the good fellow he is does the same by me as regards matters connected with sport of any kind in his calling of parish doctor he of course visits the workhouse and in that last refuge for the destitute he often am sorry to say comes across some poor old man who at one time or another has been shining light in the sporting world and who in all the garrulity of old age is only too delighted to dilate on his former glories whenever he can obtain listener from such as these then my friend roger culled many and many an story and treasured it up in his sometimes committed it to paper for fear he should forget the time came for me to pay him my usual visit which visit he always declares and believe he means it he looks forward to with more pleasure than any other event in the year well one christmas some years was agame to the last rare one went as usual to shire and roger blake there was only one regret that crossed my mind as looking out of the carriage window whilst the train was in puffed along surveyed the wrapt country which was that unless there was very sudden change of which apparently there was very small prospect should not witness that sight of all others always looked forward to during my meet of the hounds no the more looked at the weather the less liked it as one of my remarked stamping as he did so his benumbed feet on the floor of the carriage as if to give emphasis to his words we are in for stinger and no mis take at all about it no there would be no hunting no coursing no no nothing this time that was tolerably certain so quite disgusted with the prospect from the window lit cigar leaned back in my seat and amused myself with thinking over the stories of london life had got together for roger benefit and wondering whether he would have anything out of the common to tell me as usual when got out of the train at my journey end found roger waiting for me out side in the gig drawn by the old chestnut horse that knew so well the sight of them both and the greeting got game to the last from my old friend was so cheering that positively for the moment quite forgot the cold my luggage including the barrel of oysters without which never started on my christmas holiday being stowed away roger set the old horse going and away we went into the snow bound country at as good pace as could be expected under the circumstances we had only some three miles to go but the cold was so intense and the road so bad that it was which of the three of us was best pleased when we arrived at the doctor or the old horse it had been agreement between us that anything very special in the line that either of us had to tell was to be kept until christmas night so until that time arrived our conversation of an evening was confined to general topics and the relating to each other of our respective experiences since last we met we will therefore skip over the intervening days and the reader must please to imagine the christmas dinner over the cloth removed the spirit decanters lemons the materials in fact requisite for brew of hot the table and my host and myself each puffing away at cigar from the depths of couple of cosygame to the last in front of blazing fire on the top of which bright copper kettle is singing away merrily for some minutes we both sat smoking in silence and there is no saying how long we might not have gone on doing so had not the kettle evidently highly indignant at our behaviour on such an occasion suddenly boiled over and brought us to our senses roger now proceeded to brew the punch and when he had finished his congenial task once more sat down remarking as he did so well old boy hope you ve got good yarn this time for yes think have replied two or three if that all and you roger well ve only got one he rejoined but by jove it startler can assure you and what is more has the merit of being least fancy it has if you are ready to hear it tell it to you now added he and so saying he took pull at his punch settled himself in his chair and began as follows it was just about six months ago as near as can recollect that returning one evening from my usual round tired and dusty and looking forward to quiet evening all alone with my violin found message waiting for me request ing my immediate attendance at woodbine cottage small house on the bedminster road game to the last some three miles off to see gentleman there who had been taken suddenly and seriously so urgent case did it seem according to the messenger that did not even wait to swallow the cup of tea so much needed but turned the old horse round and drove off as fast as could arrived at woodbine cottage was received at the door by lady of middle age and of some what faded and careworn appearance whom recognised as having seen about the lanes when had been driving about and who had been pointed out to me as the new tenant of the cottage maiden lady of the name of beechcroft according to all accounts she was very reserved austere sort of person keeping entirely to herself and not seeing soul from one week end to another nobody in fact seemed to know who she was where she came from or anything at all about her and as there was nothing parti cularly wonderful in lone single woman of mature age settling down in cottage all by herself and as in addition she paid her way and went to church as regularly as clockwork twice of sunday no matter what the weather was the gossips could not if they would find any thing to say against her character so seeing that she was not inclined to be sociable they ceased after while to trouble their heads about her or her affairs later on however visitor arrived at thegame to the last cottage one fine day in the shape of man who it was quickly ascertained was no less person than miss beechcroft brother come to reside with his sister permanently now said the neighbours perhaps we shall see something of the interior economy of wood bine cottage but alas they were doomed to disappoint ment for if miss beechcroft was re served this brother of by name was still more so and ac cording to all accounts morose and surly into the bargain big gaunt man with haggard expression of coun tenance and scowl instead of look or word in exchange for friendly greet ing the good village folk very soon gave it as their opinion that there was mystery attached to him if there was not to hi sister game to the last oh he had rare skeleton in his cupboard according to them can tell you it was to see this george beechcroft that had been summoned so hastily to the cottage and after few words in private with the sister accompanied her upstairs to the sick man room quickly saw that it was case of paralysis which might or might not be fatal my patient though man of strong physique had all the appearance of man who had taken every sort of liberty with it not only that could not help thinking as noted the furrowed lines about the face that there was great mental as well as bodily trouble one of these two enemies is bad enough but when medical man has both to tackle then say he has superlatively difficult task before him his sister answer to my question as to what had been his occupation in life more than con firmed my suspicion her answer was comprised in two short and they were uttered with sigh and such sigh the turf asked for no more information for wanted none my sole thought now was how to bring the man back to health if it is only question of bodily ailment may have chance thought as looked at the great game to the last gaunt muscular frame before me but it is the mental was sure there was am afraid will master me well am only as you know tom poor parish doctor and had in consequence ample time to devote to this particular case in fact had beechcroft been millionaire he could not have had more undivided attention than he received from me felt too an interest in my patient apart from professional view and if the truth must be told certain amount of curiosity as to what was troubling his mind for felt sure there was something and was equally certain that his sister was not aware of it whatever it was well we triumphed in the end when say we am not alluding to my poor services alone but to miss beechcroft tender nursing which no words of mine can sufficiently praise and don really think ever felt more pleasure in my life than when one fine day found myself able to tell my patient devoted sister that her brother at last was not only out of danger but with proper care had every chance of ultimate recovery beechcroft got stronger every day thanks to his grand constitution but there was still something troubling him could see the very fact of which was quite sufficient in itself to retard my patient progress in his journey towards con valescence game to the last what this was was determined to find out if possible for reasoned that if he could be induced to make clean breast of anything that lay on his conscience to anyone in whom he had trust and confidence it would possibly be the means of relieving his mind to certain extent if he knew his trouble was shared by another person he and were very friendly by this time so one fine summer day when his sister had gone for walk broached the subject to him as delicately as could rather to my astonishment he was not in the least angry on the contrary he com plimented me on hitting off he called real reason for his illness you re quite right doctor he said have great trouble for forty years past has this demon been sitting on my shoulders like the old man of the sea and now when with one foot in the grave think of the past and what have done doctor declare to goodness am the most miserable wretch in existence in existence did say why am not fit to live if you knew all you would spurn me from and my unhappy patient buried his face in his hands and completely broke down come come beechcroft said sooth ingly this won do you know take glass of port wine and then come out into the garden andgame to the last sit quietly under the cedar yonder and tell me all about this great trouble of yours perhaps may be able to advise you for your good will if can you may he did as bade him swallowed glass of wine and taking my arm we sat ourselves down under the tree as had proposed and he at once commenced his tale forty years ago doctor said beechcroft there was no better known figure on the turf than mine my father had been bookmaker game to the last before me and when he died stepped into his shoes with reputation ready made as it were my father though was very different sort to his son his betting though large in its way was on comparatively small scale compared to mine prided myself on my dash and ness good many people called was always ready to lay point more than anybody else and rarely refused bet however big the amount most members of the ring would have been satisfied with the reputation of being the largest and most dashing bettor of them all was not so in order to make myself still more famous in the turf world started string of on my own account at first carried all before me and it really looked as if couldn go wrong it was not for considerable time that experienced anything like reverse when did though it was veritable facev in certain important handicap three horses trained in my stable were entered one be longing to me the other two the property of certain noble lord these three short time before the race we tried together with the result that my horse beat the others so decisively that the race in question appeared the greatest certainty out for him we quickly decided therefore that we would at once proceed to back one of the horses belonging to the nobleman just mentioned as blind the public would be sure to rush to getgame to the last on and make him great favourite we should then be enabled to back my horse at long odds at the same time that and my agents were laying against his stable companion as if he was dead what coup it would be to be sure backed my horse to win me an enormous sum and laid against the other to lose fortune right up to the fall of the flag the race was run imagine my rage and consternation when saw my noble confederate horse come clean away from his field and win in canter mine who had beaten him so easily in the trial coming in bad third when thieves fall out know the old saying well that was what happened now and before settling day managed to extract the whole particulars of the robbery from one of the small betting fry who had been mixed up in it and who imagining himself badly treated by his principals had promptly rounded on them as it is termed the whole affair can be explained in very few words the trainer and his noble employer when the trial took place had purposely deceived me as to the weights the horses carried and so far from my animal getting the best of it as thought the one who eventually proved the winner had something like stone in hand the best part of hundred thousand pounds mm vi the outsider to the last that little affair cost me but paid up every shilling on the monday with smiling face pre tending to know nothing about it whilst in my heart vowed revenge how that word rang in my head revenge revenge revenge sleeping and waking thought of nothing else bided my time like cat waiting for mouse and at last it came my noble confederate owned the favourite for the leger yes the corsair had won the guineas and the derby in canter and no wonder therefore that the stable looked upon the great race at doncaster as their own there was one man in the ring though who apparently did not think he would that individual was myself never ceased laying against the horse and the last bet laid to his owner in person indeed on the saturday before the race was ten thousand to five finishing up by taking four thousand to two that he did not get place on the monday morning the racing world experienced such shock as it had not received for very considerable period in the course of the day the news had spread all over the country that the favourite for the leger had been found dead in his box poisoned too everybody said game to the last yes the report proved to be perfectly true the corsair was dead and his noble owner irre trievably ruined perfect howl of indignation went up through out the land the jockey club offered reward for the discovery of the poisoner poisoned the horse was without doubt government offered another with the result that shortly after professional named dan riley was arrested on suspicion evidence was very strong against him he had been seen hanging about the yard of the inn at doncaster where my lord horses were and the lad in charge of the favourite owned to slipping away for five minutes to buy some as he said leaving the other in charge whilst he did the prisoner was committed by the magis trates to take his trial at the assizes the grand jury after reading the evidence returned true bill the judge himself patron of the turf summed up dead against him at the trial and the end of it was that in less than month from the leger day dan riley found himself lying under sentence of death in the condemned cell of york castle it was strongly suspected that the culprit had confederates in the crime and who these were some of the more energetic members of the jockey club strained every nerve to find out myselfgame to the last was called before that aristocratic body and made to show my could prove that had backed the horse as well as laid against him so they could make nothing of me meanwhile petitions were got up to the king asking for respite and every induce ment was held out to the culprit himself to make him confess who were his companions in guilt neither were of the slightest avail and who so active as in trying to make poor dan confess did not go to york and visit him every day at the prison and all to no effect the culprit last day upon earth arrived was the first to enter his cell and the last to leave it at night got the credit not only in the prison but out of it of being philanthropist of the genuine type oh if my admirers could have heard poor dan final whisper to me that night as bade him you sure it ii be all right master right as the mail dan whispered back it arrive at the last moment never you fear and then you be free once more and rich man for life dan think of that and cheer what would my admirers have said if later on that night they could have overheard con versation between me and the common hangman at the latter lodgings why should have been game to the last disguised with false beard and moustache why did count out hundred pounds in gold upon the table reminding him in hoarse whisper as did so to which he nodded an assent of his promise to do the job the second somebody was on the scaffold and even if reprieve did appear at the very last moment the man in the beard inquired it be too late if there was fifty on wasgame to the last the other reply as he locked the bag of gold safely away in desk poor dan suffered the next morning doctor and never to my dying day shall forget the wild look of anguish he cast around before the cap was drawn over his eyes in another second the drop fell with thud and was safe fell down in fit and my so doing gained me greater kudos than ever doctor said beechcroft gazing into my face you know the skeleton in my cupboard now need not tell you it was prompted dan riley to do as he that the least regret the actual poisoning of the favourite for that was simply case of tit for it was who buoyed him up to the very last moment with the hopes of reprieve thereby stopping his mouth for poor dan was very fond of life and openly declared to me that he would what he called split upon the whole business unless it was made properly clear to him that his neck was safe trust you master trust you the poor fellow would say when for the hundredth time had assured him that it was all somehow doctor wound up beechcroft though dan riley death without confession not only cleared me but actually did me good from social point of view never prospered afterwards game to the last eventually had to leave the betting ring altogether or it would have left me luckily for myself in case of accidents had bought sometime before handsome annuity for myself and settled money on my sister here as well so was all right in pecuniary sense but am miserable man and always shall be to the end of my days can you wonder at it doctor no replied can not the bishop of bc of giirb pat ijt fhmtiitg bishop of nay the celebrated wild horses so useful from time immemorial to writers of fiction shall not drag from me the name of his diocese was one of the jolliest was going to say chaps but that would never do fancy calling bishop chap how about the bishop of bath and wells though one might call him chap bath chap eh no must not be irreverent so try again the bishop of was one of the jolliest that won do either there is decided lack of dignity about the word fellow somehow that renders it unfit to apply to bishop must try another the bishop of was one of the jolliest pre lates hurrah ve got it at last that ever donned pair of lawn sleeves yes though say it that shouldn like that expression very much indeed the word donned too is very nice when the bishop of you come to analyse it there is quite soupçon of oxford and cambridge about it there is no doubt about it certain words are strangely applicable to certain people for instance if was writing about house breaker might say chris crowbar was as looking burglar as ever slipped into rascal you will observe how appropriate the words slipped into and rascal are to the profession crowbar adorns or again speaking of sportsman one might describe him as as jolly johnny very popular word johnny notice at the present time as ever popped into red coat on hunting morning and so on to return to the bishop of by jove do you know was as near as toucher just then letting out the name of his diocese he really was without exaggeration one of the jolliest and most popular prelates that ever donned lawn say nothing of bree oh dear me there am at it again mean and gaiters most jolly people you find are good doers as rule in the eating and drinking line and my bishop was no exception to the rule jolly people too are always stout and your thin sort of people may be pleasant enough but not jolly man to be strictly jolly must weigh at leastthe bishop of thirteen stone my bishop was all right in that respect also and credit to the episcopal butcher in every way now when man indulges freely night after night in the pleasures of the table his share of champagne at dinner and his bottle of claret after dinner say nothing of little extras such as whitewash in the shape of sundry glass of brown sherry such brown sherry my bishop really don know its equal anywhere glass of kummel say after the and ditto of ancient brandy with his coffee stands to reason that unless he takes proportionate amount of bodily exercise to balance matters as it were with his internal economy and keep it in good order he is extremely than likely to get that most distressing of all ailments namely the liver of course for an ordinary person of such habit nothing is easier than to keep use slangly but most expressive but odd though it may seem it is next door to an impos sibility for dignitary of the church like my bishop with penchant for good living and knack of laying on flesh to do so if his path lay in another walk of life there are hundred and one ways by which he could keep his weight down such as hunting shooting bicycling etc but situated as he is not one of these amusements is open to him the bishop of whoever yet saw bishop standing well away from covert with loader behind him knocking over or trying to rocketing pheasants as they skim over his head or blazing away in warm corner until his gun is red hot what respect would his clergy have for him if they were to see their beloved chief skimming over the ground on bicycle at the rate of hundredthe bishop of miles an hour he is even barred from tennis all this is really very hard in my opinion field mar shal or lord chief justice can do all these things with im punity why not bishop well regret to say that pre cisely what have been de scribing as likely to happen to gentleman of full habit if he did not take sufficient bodily exercise befel my own particular bishop bishop of won say where possessing superlatively good cook not one of your second rate french chefs but sympa thetic female woman who had graduated underthe bishop of no less person than the renowned francatelli him self and being blessed with an appetite that enabled him at all luncheon and to do full justice to the good things she dished up for his benefit it is not surprising that he not only succeeded in laying on large amount of superfluous flesh that he could have done very well without but that in process of time he began to feel what he himself was pleased to term very he was wont also to feel depressed and low at times especially in the much so that many and many time about twelve clock he would have given his eyes for that excellent restorative brandy and soda had he been the colonel of crack cavalry regiment he not only could but the bishop of would have rang for one on the spot but being he daren and that all about it ja what would have happened to his might have been understudy to the archbishop of canterbury so dignified not to say pompous was his master done such thing good ness only knows the long and short of it was this that after suffering in secret for some considerable time he did at last what he should have done at first called in the doctor one reason must tell you and the principal one that my pet bishop kept his sufferings to himself was that he was mortally afraid of the physicking he would to certainty have received at the hands of his wife bishop regret to say was the very opposite in every possible way to her lord and master say regret because think there is nothing pleasanter than to see jolly man married to jolly wife and lady jane oh yes she was an earl daughter and took care to let you know it can tell you had less jollity in her bishop of position than any woman ever yet came across she was tall thin and bony bony indeed that when in low dress her shoulders looked so square and stiff that they always conveyed the notion to my irreverent self that if they could have spoken they would have said say old boy hang up your hat and coat on us please her nose too might have almost expressed itself in the same way it was of the shape known as roman and very highly coloured so much so indeed that if did not know for fact that its honourable owner drank habitually nothing but should have given her the credit of being as partial to glass of good wine as her worthy husband physicking people was her special weakness the vendors indeed little knew what friend they had in her or they would feel certain have clubbed together for presenting her with the most costly testimonial that ever was seen or heard of it would have been worth their while to have purchased the for her if it had been in their power she was so impartial too one man was not favoured bit more than the other to day one was told that cockle pills were the only things to take nothing would go down with my lady but the equally renowned anon mother siegel syrup would have turn and so on the bishop of eno fruit salt and somebody else py retic saline went up and in down her ladyship estimation like game of battledore and shuttle cock it was quite case between the pair now we go up up up now we go down down the good bishop was well aware of all this and trembled in his very gaiters when he thought of how his wife would physic him if she only knew how he was and said he to himself ll take very good care she do accordingly instead of doing like nine bishops out of ten would have done remaining in bed and sending to his doctor to come and see him he without saying word to anybody just put on the episcopal hat one fine morning after breakfast and assuming his jauntiest air whilst he hummed bar or two from the hallelujah chorus for the express benefit of the archbishop of canterbury understudy who condescended to open the front door for him walked off to see his bishop of chapter ii if the doctor whom our bishop went to consult had been one of the ordinary run of doctors the chances are that after listening with deferential attention to his patient account of himself and his symptoms he very long face you may be proceeded to frighten his victim out of his wits by the vague hints he threw out casually and then after writing out prescription of fearful import intelligible to no living soul except himself and the chemist ordered him off to algeria or possibly siberia for doctors nowadays are funny fellows and it is hard to say where they won tell you to go or what to take but not being one of the perpetually washing his hands in invisible soup gentry with an oily tongue and as full of fads as an egg is of meat on the contrary being man of few words and plain of speech as his which was brief inspection of his patient he summed up the situation in very few words your liver all wrong my lord that what the bishop of the matter with you said he you must put the muzzle on and take rrfore exercise else be hanged if you won be in queer quite see that answered the bishop but it all very well for you to talk about taking exercise my good friend you don seem to realise that person in my position can not take his recreation like an ordinary mortal what would people say for instance if went shootingthe bishop of or hunting or fenced or boxed about on bicycle can even play how about riding said the doctor horse exercise would be the finest thing of all for you if you cared for it nothing like it assure you brings into play nearly every muscle in the human body without used to ride great deal in my salad days when was up at oxford replied the bishop and there is nothing should like better than to have good gallop occasionally if thought people would not say it was infra let em exclaimed brown contemp tuously shall send you blue pill to take and my advice rather my orders are yourself horse as quickly as possible if not sooner and go out for good ride every day of your life believe me it the best cure for dyspepsia will exclaimed the bishop heartily rising to go and here my hand upon it by the way added he perhaps you wouldn mind letting it be known that you have ordered me horse exercise in case people should talk don you know never fear said the doctor ll see to that you may and off went the bishop to his palace with step so jaunty and so pleased an expression of countenance that everyone he met wondered at the cause the bishop of arrived at the palace he retired straightway to his study and setting himself down at his indited note to his chaplain requesting his presence at luncheon as he wished to see him on very important business having transacted which little piece of business the good man betook himself to his own particular easy chair and indulged in prolonged and hearty chuckle then the thought suddenly occurred to him how will lady jane like my appearing on horse back and he looked quite grave but twas only momentarily for he reasoned to himself even she can say anything when the doctor distinctly orders me to and once again the episcopal countenance was wreathed in smiles another thought then crossed his mind it is extraordinary what odd things do cross our minds occasionally what if should come across the hounds when am out for ride one fine day and what if my horse my naughty wicked horse should take it into his head to run away and join em and this jocose idea so tickled the bishop that he leaned back in his chair and laughed till the tears ran down his countenance just then the rumbling of the gong announced that iuncheon was ready so wiping his eyes the bishop wended his way to the wherethe bishop of he found lady jane and his chaplain who having received his note had just arrived now the good bishop invariably made hearty meal in the middle of the day and his wife there fore was considerably astonished when she saw her husband refuse the hashed dish she knew he was particularly fond himself with the wing of chicken and slice of tongue and instead of his accustomed claret taking glass of sherry well diluted with seltzer water you seem to have lost your appetite robert said lady jane in her deep voice eyeing her husband severely as she spoke am ill replied her husband in such grave tone of voice that the chaplain and the solemn butler quite started am ill have been to see brown he says there is only one thing for me jane good man voice trembled at this point and that exercise taken regularly once day but it is so unclerical said to him can help that he replied it is your only chance and if you don take it will not answer for the so see nothing for it my dear said the bishop with sigh of resigna tion but to bow to the inevitable and purchase horse with all possible despatch and with that view littledale said the venerable prelate turning to his chaplain wrote to you to come here to lunch in order that we the bishop of might consult together as to how this is to be could brown suggest nothing else but that you should take to riding on horseback en quired lady jane solemnly othing replied her husband stay though he added am wrong he did say something about my going algiers think he said for year or so but knowing as did my dear your dread of travelling at once knocked that idea on the said lady jane evidently somewhat mollified journey of that description of course would be as you say quite out of the least so far as am much as dislike the idea of your appearing in public on horseback suppose there is no alternative but for you to obey your and so saying she rose from the table and swept in dignified manner out of the room and now said the bishop taking his reverend chaplain familiarly by the arm let you and go into the library and have talk about things in general and horseflesh in the rev charles littledale chaplain to the lord bishop of had his admirers and his detractors the former declared that he was all that young english clergyman should be looking with manner that was taking alike with his equals and his more humblethe bishop of friends where would you find man better qualified than he for the charge of country parish his detractors amongst whom was lady jane expressed their opinions freely that in entering the church littledale had sadly mistaken his vocation how could man be good church man who played cricket football and dressed habitually in the unorthodox style adopted by the bishop chaplain they argued remonstrances were of no avail either with him privately or his patron the bishop the former declared that the soft squashy head gear usually sported by the curate of the period would fidget him to death not being used to wearing anything soft on his head and as for an and high if he knew it at any price the younger son of country squire he was naturally conversant with the habits and ways of the rural population the sports of the field in which he so freely indulged when at home naturally throwing him very much amongst them in point of fact during his early boyhood he was uncon sciously educating himself for the post of parish priest his education proper was conducted at eton and both of which places we are bound to say that he distinguished himself more in the cricket field than at his studies not that he was idle far from it he was too the bishop of conscientious to his father to be that he was simply fair scholar and no more there was no denying his prowess however in the world of sport and as for popularity it would have been hard indeed to have found his equal from among his fellows we have mentioned his partiality for cricket but it was at hunting that during his time at the university he distinguished himself most his father kept one horse for him and with this hiring occasionally from charley symonds and frequent mounts from friends he usually managed to get his four days week all through the season with the heytlirop lord macclesfield and the bicester our friend figured in silk too on more than one occasion at aylesbury during his sojourn at the varsity with such marked success indeed that had he chosen to have gone in for steeplechase riding on an extensive scale there is no doubt that his services would have been much in request on his taking holy orders he at once dropped his hunting confining himself to day shooting or fishing now and again it caused deal of heartburning you depend when the day came for charley littledale to put away for good and all the red coat the leathers and that had so often figured in the front rank in quick thing from bradwell grove or steeple aston the bishop of that cerise and jacket and cap too would sometimes even now take them out of the drawer where they were put away in laven der and look at them with sigh of regret what pleasant recollections of his salad days did they not recall the bishop of when would he ever feel so proud again as on that day at aylesbury when he did the veteran rider captain downey on the post by short head feat achieved by nothing but sheer horsemanship so the sporting journals of the day declared yes those gallops between the flags were im mense fun and he would uncommonly like to have them all over again the breaking of his leg and rib or two included this then is slight sketch of the gentleman whom the good bishop now ushers into his bishop of turn to consult with on the purchase of horse and we think it will be admitted that he could not have made better choice the bishop first act on reaching his sanctum sanctorum was to change his coat for looking garment of black serge his next was to take cigar case from drawer which he first handed to his chaplain and then helped him self from the two cigars well under weigh and the smokers settled down in their the prelate opened the proceedings as charles was aware he said brown ordered him horse exer cise and needless to say in order to carry out the doctor orders he must purchase horse now want said the bishop leaning forward in his chair and emphasising his words by tap ping his chaplain knee with his forefinger want two of the best hunters to be had for money and am going to ask you to run up to town and buy em for me can you start certainly my lord replied the rev charles considerably astonished but may ask what you want two for surely one would be enough would it not the other one is for you my boy replied the bishop for you and nobody else detest riding by myself and object to groom so intend you to accompany me on all occasions the bishop of and great many pleasant rides we shall have together have no you re very good sure my lord gasped charles his breath almost taken away shall be only too pleased of course about the horses he enquired suppose you like them thoroughly quiet and well replied the bishop of course should like as safe conveyance as wouldn but at the same time don at all object to horse with little go about him don run away with the impression charles that because bishop have never been on the top of horse bless you ve figured in silk jacket at aylesbury before now as well as your you dog you here the bishop worked his arms as if he was finishing and as for hunting kept three horses and hack and hired as well all the time was up somehow had sort of idea all along my lord that you had been sportsman in your youth said his chaplain with grin well you were right returned the bishop and now said he there nothing else to do but to hand you the sinews of war in the shape of blank cheque and then you can be off as soon as you like here it is see there is no occasion to hurry back you want to see thethe bishop of horses jumped no doubt and perhaps get on them yourself and that all takes oh you want horse that can jump well inquired the chaplain of course do charles why supposing in one of our rides we should accident of come across the hounds and my horse and yours persisted in joining them you wouldn put me on the back of brute that couldn jump would you what and the bishop apparently much amused at the notion he had conjured up and clapping the rev charles littledale who was evidently much amused also heartily on the back pushed him out of the door and bade him start off to london with all possible despatch on his expedition the bishop of chapter iii few days time the rev charles littledale wrote down to his pat ron to say that he had been lucky enough to pick up two nags at lord bonniboy brown and at three hundred and the other at two hundred and fifty he had every reason to believe were perfect treasures he had at the same time taken it upon himself to engage groom expressly to look after them valuable hunters like the pair he had purchased as he justly remarked requiring more skill and attention than lady jane serious coachman was likely to bestow upon them he wound up by expressing hope that he had not encroached too heavily on the bishop cheque book and said that he and his new purchases with their attendant groom might be expected on the following day by the train that arrived at at grimes the serious coachman who was highly indignant at being treated in what he considered shabby and underhand other words that he had been done out of his just dues in notthe bishop of being sent to buy the horses instead of the reverend sulkily down to the station pre pared to pick any amount of holes in the new purchases on their arrival to say therefore that he was rather taken aback when he recognised the quality of the two horses as they stepped quietly on to the platform from their respective boxes is hardly the word well what do you think of them grimes inquired the chaplain nice lookin osses enough sir nice lookin osses enough sir replied the coachman with slight touch of his hat ope they re sound sir ope they re sound he added as much as to say all is not gold that sound exclaimed the rev charles with laugh if you re only half as sound grimes you do and that all about glad of it sir glad of it growled the dis gusted coachman in tone of voice that said plainly doubt it very much all the great was the sensation as tom trim the new groom having got his two charges in marching order mounted one and leading the other pro ceeded to make the best of his way through the town towards the episcopal stables be lad inquired stiggles the stuttering saddler rushing out as they passed his shop in the high street the ejaculated he in the bishop of as tom trim answered his query well ham and forthwith divesting himself of his white apron he scuttled down the street to his house of call the white hart where rushing into the parlour he informed the inmates that he had two osses belonging to the pass up the good enough to win the the major magsby the recognised paul pry of the place strutting up the high street with his glass stuck in his eye in his usual aggressive manner was the next to take stock of them and bid tom trim stand and deliver two minutes afterwards old squibsby who did not know horse from cow pulled him up short in like manner tomthe bishop of trim might well begin to wonder when he should get home it is really astonishing what lot of interest people take in their neighbours affairs the bishop ok chapter iv bishop new purchases turned out complete success he and his chaplain went out for quiet ride two days after the horses arrived and it was hard to say which of the two nags they liked best by previous arrangement the bishop and the rev charles until they got clear of the town endeavoured to appear as ignorant of the art of equitation as possible for the benefit of the public at large and it was treat to see the way the good bishop held his reins and his whip and how he stuck his heels up and toes down his chaplain the same anybody looking at the pair of them would have put them down as two of the veriest muffs that ever got astride horse not only would have but did for as matter of fact the eccentric horsemanship of the bishop and his companion was the cause of much derisive comment on the part of the bystanders as they rode through the streets if the said bystanders though could have seen the objects of their mirth some bishop of wards when they reached the downs they would fancy have been rather astonished to say the least of it this is delightful perfectly delightful ex claimed the bishop as he and the rev charles after riding the road for some time suddenly found themselves at point where the downs stretched away as far as one could see to the right and the left of them this is delightful repeated he again taking his horse on to the turf and putting him into canter delightful indeed echoed his chaplain how do you like the bay my lord by this time he enquired the bishop of the nicest horse ever got on perfection can find fault with him replied the bishop leaning for ward in his saddle and giving the bay hearty slap on the neck an endearment which the animal reciprocated by making playful bite at his lord ship boot wonder which is the fastest of the two charles presently observed the bishop as after canter they drew rein and pulled up into walk once more wonder which is the fastest of the two do you know should be almost in clined to back the nag you are on at mile he not so big or powerful quite as the bay but he bit better bred should say and quicker on his legs what do you say charles fancied his patron horse was the fastest and said so though he added the extra weight the bishop rode at least two stone heavier than he did might tell how would it be he suggested to get on to the racecourse grand stand belonging to which now loomed in sight and have regular trial there nobody about to see us he added coaxingly as he saw the bishop looking round him suspiciously on hearing the proposal really think we might do you know re plied the prelate with smile besides added he his eyes twinkling with merriment the bishop of if anybody did see us it would probably only appear to them as if our horses had got little out of our hands what just so replied the chaplain trying to smother laugh and failing signally in the attempt lead on then said the bishop and let us to business at so the rev charles littledale turned his horse head and followed by his patron con tinued gaily along in the direction of the race course as they neared it he suddenly pulled up quite forgot all about the rails my lord exclaimed he how stupid of one to be sure if we want to get into the we shall have to jump here my answer to that quoth the bishop sending his horse without moment hesitation straight at the rails the bay jumped them like bird his jolly rider flourishing his in the air as they rose he then turned round to watch his chaplain performance which need less to say was equally artistic both as regards horse and man let me see observed the latter looking about him this is the straight run in where we are now so yonder as he spoke to post discernible in the must be where they start for the mile to this point the pair accordingly made theirthe bishop of way and having arrived there turned their horses round and prepared for the coming struggle there was no delay at the post you may be sure merely off we go from the bishop and away they went the rev charles on the brown making strong truth being that that noble animal had got trifle out of his rider hand the latter soon pulled him together how ever and when the pair got into the straight for home there was very little to choose between them one moment the bishop looked like winning the next his chaplain it was in truth very devil of race and had it taken place in public must have led to anytamount of betting as the bishop of the horses were running the end of it was that my lord bishop won somewhat cleverly though between ourselves we can not help thinking from what has come to our knowledge since that the rev charles littledale out of deference to his superior officer did not exert himself quite as much in the final struggle for supremacy as he might have done that may or may not be at all events the bishop showed that with increasing years he had not forgotten how to finish that he was un commonly pleased with his both horse and himself goes without saying and his face was study when turning round to his chaplain as they rode quietly homewards he told him that he felt almost like boy again already as for brown he couldn say sufficient in his praise he must really buy the doctor some little present he thought as memento of his extraordinary skill in the treatment of that ailment we are all so subject to the liver complaint hooray for good brown say bishop of chapter the expiration of week the in habitants of the old cathedral town had got so used to the daily appear ance on horseback of their reverend bishop with his familiar spirit the rev charles littledale in attendance that they scarcely took any notice as the pair jogged along through the streets in all the pride of apparently most indifferent equestrianism so well did they act their respective parts indeed that they even took in lady jane serious coachman the great grimes who would declare to tom trim the hunting groom charles littledale had brought with him from london that it was in his opinion puffect shame to putt two such muffs as them alluding to his master and his chaplain on two such splendacious tom trim however being shrewd fellow had his suspicions and would say nothing in reply the bishop being well aware of all this thought that the time had now arrived when he and his chaplain might with safety make themselves trifle more comfortable not to say sportsmanlike about the legs the bishop of accordingly one fine day in lieu of the episcopal gaiters appeared most workmanlike pair of butcher boots the chaplain leaner extremities being adorned in similar fashion the bishop in moment of playfulness had suggested to the rev charles that he should mount pair of those extraordinary contrivances known as antigropelos as having more clerical appearance than the napoleon or butcher boot but at that notion the chaplain struck at once no no my lord laughed he fair play jewel don you know like master like man so far as regards boots at any so you shall charles returned the jolly prelate clapping his chaplain heartily on the back it was only my fun only wish we could don leathers and tops once more eh my boy well it was funny thing but the very first day this worthy pair put on their new boots the strangest adventure befell them that you ever heard tell of that day was indeed day in both their calendars and one venture to say that will never be forgotten by either of them they had made an earlier start than usual that morning the horses having been ordered at half past ten instead of eleven and enough when they got clear of the palace number of other equestrians seemed to have taken it intothe bishop of their heads to choose the same hour for ride in the country dear me exclaimed the bishop where can they all be going to wonder shouldn wonder my lord replied the rev charles with sly twinkle in his eye if the old harkaway hounds think they call not meeting somewhere in the neighbourhood and now am positive he added for look my lord there is red coat just ahead of us oh yes there is evidently meet somewhere close ah well said the bishop we must avoid the meet charles suppose you don happen to know in which direction the fox is likely to make if they find him do you because if you did we might accidentally meet them don you know if we could do so without danger of heading the fox wouldn be guilty of that great sin for anything said the bishop with shake of his head haven hunted in this country since was boy my lord replied the chaplain but think know where to place our two selves so that we shall see some of the fun without the trouble of going to the just then some mounted men cantered up saluting the bishop as they passed who in his turn inquired where the hounds met at norton priory colonel blazer place the bishop of they told him the colonel was going to entertain his friends at breakfast they added so that there would be very large meet they it sure find too either in long wood or the osier bed chimed in another sportsman so we re pretty certain to have good specially if the fox makes for hoggesden remarked third sportsman ah well wish you good sport said the bishop as they once more saluted his lordship and trotted on their way and now come along my lord exclaimed the rev charles as they came to place where three roads met we ll branch off here if you please and make for point of vantage know of from whence fancy we shall be able to see all that is going jogging on gently for couple of miles or so the rev charles at last came to full stop am rather in doubt said he and should like to ask question before we go any further wonder if there is anybody about chop chop chop went the billhook of farm labourer who was mending the hedge overhanging the road little higher up and whom he had not perceived until now which is the way to peartree farm my man said he riding up and feeling in his pocket for bishop of muster longman ye mean replied the man after hearty stare yes replied the rev charles at venture that be it over theer said the rustic pointing straight across the road but you can git to it until you git into the lunnon road about arf mile furder on and then tis the fust turnin on yer well but if it only just beyond that spinney yonder said his questioner surely we can reach it nearer than that can we get through that gate and follow the path and then through the wood the bishop op the gate be locked was the reply and you can take it off the hinges said the chaplain that nuisance ah well thank you all the same and here trifle for you at the same time handing the man as he spoke the sixpence he had got ready for him thankee kindly said the man resuming his work as if nothing had happened nuisance not being able to get through the gate observed the rev charles it is said the bishop but stay my young friend he exclaimed here is stile at the side surely we can manage that between us oh certainly replied his chaplain mutter ing to himself what an old gamecock it is to be sure should have proposed it only did not know if you liked that sort of fence shall give you lead my lord do replied his lordship the chaplain accordingly took his horse back pace or two and sent him at the stile alas blackbird flying suddenly out of the hedge startled the horse and made him refuse before he could right him again the bishop had trotted his horse up to it and had hopped over it like bird the chaplain horse then followed suit the next gate they found open and then enter ing the spinney beyond they finally found them selves close to peartree farm past this theythe bishop of rode and keeping along the field road they finally drew up on an eminence overlooking the river slush which ran parallel with them two fields off beyond that again being succession of vast pastures finally terminating in long range of wood there said the rev charles as he pulled up his horse and pointing with his whip to the distant wood that is where expect they will draw first at least they always used to and if they find in the and the fox crosses the river we shall nick in with them beautifully hark thought heard the so did said the bishop cocking his head on one side to listen the more readily they both listened most attentively for some minutes the horses as if quite entering into the spirit of the thing keeping as still as mice not sound was to be heard but an occasional champ of one their bits suddenly the chaplain broke the silence with that holloa for pony by jingo so it is exclaimed the bishop waxing as unclerical in his language in the excite ment of the moment as his subordinate yes and bydhe lord harry there the fox said the rev charles in great state of excite ment see my lord yonder he goes just beyond those cows that shepherd dog has gone at him and turned him from his point and the bishop of he cross the river lower down as sure as gun if he does the field will have to come right back here for there is no ford for miles down that way and they ll all be clean out of it unless they swim it there go the hounds too my word how they re running come along my lord we will get forward and we shall not only nick in with them but shall have em all to our selves it strikes me by jove what lark muttered the chaplain to himself as he set his horse going best pace wouldn have missed this for bishopric and away he and the bishop galloped and pulling up under tree some three fields off had the satisfaction of seeing the fox cross the river just below them not until they had seen him well away did they move on to await the arrival of the hounds yow yow yow on they came so close to gether that sheet would have covered them splash they go into the river over the water to my lord says the chaplain with grin not soul was with them but one of the whips and two youthful swells in scarlet evidently riding against each splash goes the whip horse as he lands right into the middle of the river he then begins to swim like duck and in another minute they scramble up the other side and away again the horse of one of the youthful swells stopsthe bishop of short sending his rider over his head into the water whilst he himself gallops off in an opposite direction the other refuses altogether and find ing it is no use trying to make him face the water his rider at last cropping him heartily turns him round and gallops off after the rest of the field in search of friendly ford meanwhile the hounds are running hard and only four people with them these four com prising the lord bishop of his chaplain the first whip who rides along with his tongue in his cheek and butcher boy on pony with basket of meat on his arm intended for the early dinner of the household of peartree farm the butcher boy and his pony and his basket presently the bishop of getting hung up in bullfinch the number is reduced to three quite mile behind the master his huntsman and the field come pounding along grinding their teeth and anathematising the fox for having crossed the river just where he did and the river for being in the way at all wondering at the same time who the two chaps in black are who have got the hounds all to themselves will they never check yes at last they do at the top of yonder hill and dashed if one of the hasn taken the pack in hand and is making cast on his own aking cast and with good effect too for see the bishop of they ve hit off the scent and are off again at score the master grins with rage as the two and the scarlet top the fence and disappear over the brow of the hill he is so angry that he can scarcely see where he is going and the next minute he is bonneted by bough of tree as he rises at fence and nearly knocked off his horse never was in such rage at last he and his train band bold reached the brow of the hill over which he had seen his hounds disappear and as they did so an unmistakable came wafted on the breeze to their angry ears no need for the shepherd in the far corner of the field to shout and point with his finger to the valley below the hounds could be plainly seen baying round figure in scarlet whilst two men in black were on foot by their horses it was an unmistakable kill in the open never was so done brown in my life muttered the master sending his horse along down the steep hill at pace that was perfectly appalling and by bishop too he exclaimed in astonish ment as he galloped furiously up to the pack well am and they said he couldn ride too you seem to have had good thing my lord said he as the bishop approached him most enjoyable canter indeed sir george replied the in bishop of canter thought the baronet that good one wonder what he calls gallop when my by the way let me introduce to you the rev charles littledale george my chaplain and started for our little ride this morning we little thought that we should meet the hounds and that our horses would insist positively insist sir george much against our will of joining them but so it turned out however as all well that ends well and we have been lucky enough to ride the run without accident we must not complain exclaimed sir george should think not indeed minutes over the grass as hard as ever you could go with the hounds all to yourselves and kill in the open to wind up with is not thing to complain about don think only wish had been in your shoes know by the way sir continued sir george turning suddenly round to the rev charles may ask are you any relation to my old friend henry littledale of hawley grange only younger brother sir george replied charles smiling give me your hand delighted believe me to make your acquaintance and on such an occasion said sir george now in the best of tempers and shaking him warmly by the bishop of nope he added this won be the last time sh all see you out with my hounds by good and now my lord said the turning again to the bishop trust you
